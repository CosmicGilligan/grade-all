1. Why was the Electoral College not able to choose a President in 1800?
2. Why was the House of Representatives deadlocked and unable to choose a President in 1800?
3. How was the election of 1800 resolved? (I'm asking about how the conflict was settled, not who won)
4. Why did Jefferson call the election of 1800 a "revolution?" (Hint: what is a revolution?) Why is this election a world changing event?
