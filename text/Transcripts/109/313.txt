In this segment we will consider the first two consequences of the great war for empire that contributed to the American Revolution. The first we will refer to as creole patriotism. After that, we will examine how british indian policy enraged Americans during the war. The british parliament enacted the Quartering act. This act mandated that colonists house and feed british soldiers stationed in America. Imagine the intrusion enjoying your Saturday evening at home when a contingent of soldiers demands entry and sustenance. The act was a clear violation of privacy. However, the issue went beyond mere practicality. It reflected a broader european attitude that viewed the Americas and everything within it as inferior. This sentiment wasn't unique to the British. Spanish and french colonists likely faced similar prejudices. A french naturalist, Georges Louis Leclaire Kont de Beaufort, even used a zoological comparison to illustrate this point. He contrasted the mighty war horses of Europe with the weak, passive deer of America. This underlying arrogance permeated all social classes and undoubtedly informed the behavior of british soldiers stationed in the colonies. They likely viewed the colonists as uncultured and backwards, ignorant Hicks. This disrespect would naturally breed resentment among the colonists. In response to this treatment, a sense of american identity distinct from british identity began to solidify. Historians refer to this phenomenon as creole patriotism, emphasizing the colonists'emerging sense of self and their growing attachment to their american home. Let's first clarify the definition of creole in this historical context. While the term is often associated with New Orleans, it has a broader meaning. Here, a creole is an individual born in the Americas whose parents emigrated from elsewhere, typically Europe. In New Orleans, this meant people of french descent born on american soil. Similarly, within the spanish colonies, someone born in the Americas to spanish parents would be considered a creole. In the british colonies, a large portion of the population would fall under this definition, as many were born in America with english ancestry. Fueled by british arrogance and their constant denigration of the colonists, the creoles began asserting a distinct identity. They countered arguments of american inferiority by highlighting positive elements of their society. They emphasized the abundance of land, cleaner environment, higher infant survival rate, and general prosperity they enjoyed. In contrast to Britain, this counterargument served as a turning point. The creoles began to view their differences not as deficiencies but as strengths. This shared experience of being looked down upon by the british fostered common ground. It sparked the emergence of a unified american identity, one that the creoles proudly embraced and defended. So why is this shift in perspective? Significant unity fosters strength. Remember, we're building towards the American Revolution, a fight for independence from Britain. How can a revolution for american independence occur without a unified american population. Recognizing their distinct identity from the British was essential. The british arrogance then inadvertently fueled this nascent nationalism we call Creole patriotism. It instilled a minimal sense of unity among the colonists, while regional identities remained distinct. A shared identity as American began to take root. This realization that they were fundamentally different from the British became a critical development in forging the belief that America could exist as an independent nation. Another consequence of the war was american resentment of british indian policy. Tensions rose between the colonists and the crown regarding westward expansion. During the war, colonists were motivated by the potential for acquiring land in the west. Many, in fact, were promised such land for their service. However, british policy postwar directly contradicted these expectations. King George II issued the proclamation of 1763 establishing a boundary line, the proclamation line that restricted colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. This restriction infuriated the colonists for several reasons. Firstly, they felt they had earned the right to westward expansion through their wartime contributions. Secondly, many colonists held promises of land grants in the very territories now declared off limits. This perceived betrayal by the crown fueled significant resentment among the colonists.
