Let's see how this works in a real world example, okay? And the first thing we have to do is we have to think a little bit about mexican history. Okay? We've already discussed briefly the independence of Spanish America when we talked about the Monroe doctrine. What happens in Mexico is that there is a long civil war. It starts in 1810. And if many of you, if you know anything about Mexico, you know that Mexican Independence Day is September 16 and die cis. And it is the anniversary of el Grito, which was the cry of liberty that was announced by Hidalgo on September 16, 1810. So that's the day that they celebrate independence, but they didn't actually gain independence until 1821. Okay? So it's kind of like in the United States, we celebrate american independence on July 4, but America didn't actually gain independence until 1783. You guys follow what I'm saying? So, at any rate, the point here is that Mexico becomes an independent country in 1821. When it becomes independent, the first government that's installed is a constitutional monarchy. But that government doesn't last very long. Let me just say. Let me say it this way, that the controversy that plagued the United States in the first administration over what kind of a country is the United States. Is it an economic powerhouse, a conservative state, or is it a liberal state? Every other independent country attaining independence during this period of time experienced something similar. So in Mexico, instead of calling them federalists and democratic republicans, they call them centralists and federalists, okay? And the centralists were the more conservative ones. And the centralists believed that the Mexico, the independent Mexico should be ruled in the same way that it had been under the spanish monarchy. Because under the spanish monarchy, the people that were in control had made lots of money. Right? So centralism basically says everything has to be ruled from the center. During the monarchy, the center was the king. But now that they're a republic, the center is the government in Mexico City. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. But at the same time, the government that Mexico installed was a federal government, meaning a government like the United States that has two levels of government, a federal government and a state government. But in the mexican constitution, the state governments were much more powerful than the governments in the United States. Okay? And the result of that was that the federalists believe that most of the authority in the country should reside in the states rather than in the central government. So it's really. It's very similar to what happened in the United States. The problem is that in the United States, we saw that controversy between centralism and federalism or between federalists and democratic Republicans become the subject of american politics. And the differences between the two different ideals are worked out in the ballot box, and that's because of the election of 1800 and the peaceful transfer of power. But that doesn't happen in Mexico or anywhere else. Right. What happens instead is that when the original group is voted out of office, they refuse to leave office, and after every election, they have an uprising. Essentially it's called a pronunciamiento, right? And they fight it out. So the way that it works in Mexico is going to be that they have the election, and then whoever loses the election refuses to give up, and then they fight it out. And whoever wins the battle wins the government, essentially. Right. That makes sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? You guys are following me here. And the division between the centralists and the federalists is as bad or worse as the division between the democratic Republicans and the federalists in the United States. And essentially what it means is that they're willing to kill each other in order to gain control of the government. All right, you guys are all with me with this. Questions? Comments? So the first government that was actually enacted in, like I said, in Mexico was a federalist government. And during this time of the federalist government, there was one of the problems that Mexico had was the northern frontier, because the northern frontier, let me just show you a map here. The northern frontier consists of all of these territories, okay? And these territories are very sparsely populated by Mexicans, okay? Mexican. The Mexican, the hispanic lifestyle. Hispanic culture is an urban culture, and they don't want to live out in the middle of nowhere, a little house on a prairie, right? And so most of the population of Mexico was, was concentrated in the cities. And since there really weren't any cities in this vast northern territory, hardly anybody went there. And they couldn't even get people to go there. They couldn't even, they couldn't even lure people there or bribe them to go there. And the problem was that the border between the United States and Mexico was, was fluid. Nobody actually really knew where it was. And beyond that, that Americans and others, particularly Americans, I mean, the Russians and the British, also had their eyes on California. Right, and Texas. But the Americans are very aggressive about their ideas of, of taking this territory. So Mexico. So Mexico, when it becomes independent, is concerned about the integrity of their border. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? You guys are all following me here, right? Okay. So now, in the 1830s, 1820s, there was an economic downturn in the United States, and there was a group of people who decided that they wanted to emigrate to find better opportunity. And they were led by this guy Moses. Not Moses from the Bible, but Moses Austin. Right? Moses Austin went to Mexico City to negotiate, moving into Texas, bringing a group of people into Texas. And he received permission to bring these people into Texas. The idea, the agreement, was that he could bring in 20,000 settlers, but that those settlers had to become mexican citizens, and they had to swear allegiance to Mexico, they had to learn how to speak Spanish, and they had to become Catholics, all right? And so here these people are faced with the opportunity to get free land. And keep in mind that land is still considered to be wealth, right? These people are faced with the possibility of attaining free land if they learn how to speak Spanish. And so they say, hola, I'm Mexican, right? And so they all move in, and there's actually a concentration of Americans in Texas. All right? Now we want to say, okay, well, this was supposed to solve the problem of the mexican government by actually creating 20,000 mexican citizens in Texas. And legally, technically, that was true, but in reality, the people that moved into Texas never considered themselves Mexicans. They always considered themselves american, and they always believed that at some point, Texas would become part of the United States. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so now, this guy, Stephen Austin, was the guy who led all of the people in. Here's what happens when we're looking at this centralist federalist controversy. When. When the Americans moved into Texas, one of the understandings that they had was that they would be self governing because this was under the federalist government, okay? And so their authority would be local to them, just like many people in the United States believed. And as part of that, they counted on the ability to own slaves, because the economy of Texas was a plantation economy, like everywhere else in the south, okay? And so when they moved in there, there was this understanding that Texas would be. Would be allowed to. The settlers in Texas would be allowed to use slaves, right, to own slaves, and that they would be relatively self governing, okay? But in 1826, the mexican government outlawed slavery. So there was a bit of a kerfuffle in Texas because the settlers in Texas were all upset because they thought they were going to lose their slaves. But they made a deal with the mexican government that they could keep their slaves for now, even though at some point, they're going to have to get rid of them. But, okay. So that kind of solves that problem a little bit. But there's another problem, and that is that even though there are 20,000 american settlers that were allowed to come in because they're there, a number of other Americans are crossing the border illegally to get into Texas to squat on the land. Right. So if you cross the border from one country to another country without permission, what do you call that? Illegal immigration. Illegal immigration. So Mexico had a terrible illegal immigration problem from Americans. You guys are following me here. All right? And so what they did is they decided they were going to close the border, right? They didn't. They didn't build a wall, but they were going to close the border to keep the Americans out. Right? And in the middle of all this, there's this political turmoil between centralists and federalists that's happening. And in 1836, the centralists actually overturned the government and rewrote the constitution. Okay? And that constitution then placed the power in Mexico, in the central government, which meant that Texas now could no longer rule itself, that it had to, that it was ruled directly by the central government in Mexico. You guys follow me here? And that meant that they had to get rid of their slaves. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? Now, I should mention in terms of. I mean, you don't know a lot about mexican history, but I do, right. That when the centralists took over, Texas declares independence. But Texas isn't the only place. There were a number of different states in Mexico that declared independence because they were. Because they felt that their power had been curtailed with this idea of the. What sort of. I'm looking for centralist government taking power away from the states. Okay? But what happens in Texas is that the Americans in Texas declare independence, and then they vote they create a government, a constitutional government, and they apply for admission to the United States. Okay? Now I want to mention a couple things here about that. The first one is when Texas declared independence, they declared their territory to consist of everything north of the Rio Bravo. And I don't know if you guys will remember, but a couple of weeks ago, we talked about how the border of Texas was understood always to be at the Nueces, and everybody agreed on that. The United States agreed on that. Mexico agreed on that. France agreed on that. England agreed on that. Everybody agreed that this was the border of Texas. When Texas declared independence, they said the border was at the Rio Bravo. Why did they say that? Well, the reason why was because, if you guys will recall, when they were negotiating the Treaty of Adams Onis, which was negotiating the treaty between the United States and Mexico over the boundary that the United States had opened its arguments with the. With the Rio Bravo or the Rio Grande, and that was an open kind of bargaining chip. Right? And at the end, they settled for the boundary here at the Sabine. Okay, you guys are with me. So, from the point of view of. After the Treaty of Adams Onis, from the point of view of the United States, the border of Texas was at the Nueces. Actually, from the point of view of both the United States and Mexico, the border of Texas was at the Nueces, and the border of the United States was at the Sabine and the red. And that the real Bravo wasn't anything. Okay, you guys, follow me here. You guys need to pay attention, because this is going to be important in a minute. It's a little complicated, but it's important. Okay, so. So Texas declares that its border is at the Rio Bravo, and then that's when you're going to see the invasion of Texas from Mexico, led by Santa Ana. Santa Ana was President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, and he leads an army into Texas to try to force Texas back into compliance, I guess, or into union with Mexico City. And he's defeated. He wins Adelaide, the Alamo. You guys have all. You guys have all heard of the Alamo, and if you've ever been there, you'll see that it's like a shrine where Texans celebrate their freedom, and we'll just leave it at that for now. But at any rate, the Mexicans won the battle at the Alamo, but they lost the battle at another place just near Houston called San Jacinto. The mexican army was defeated. Santa Anna was captured, and he was forced to sign a document recognizing the independence of Texas. Okay, so Texas becomes independent, theoretically, in 1836, even though what happens after that is that Santa Ana is freed. And then he denies that. He actually. He said he signed the paper under duress, and they. And everybody in Mexico denies that Texas is independent. And every mexican government swears that they're going to eventually force Texas back into the union, but they can't do it right now because they're too busy fighting each other. Okay, so the political unrest in Mexico prevents any trying to force Texas back into union, but at the same time, everybody in Mexico believes that Texas is part of the mexican territory. You guys follow what I'm saying? And it's a big political issue. If anybody ever says in Mexico only just let Texas go, they're considered to be a traitor. And any government that considers giving up Texas can't last.
