We talked about how the War of 1812 had led to the end of the two of the first party system because the Federalists kind of passed from the scene. The Federalists became. Were viewed as traitors, in a way, because they had been against the War of 1812. And so there's a period of time between 1814 or so and the 1820s when basically there's only one party, and it's the same as the democratic Republicans that were the first party. Okay? And as I also mentioned to you, politics at that time then becomes regional. Okay? And so what happens then, in 1824, there's an election, a presidential election, and the three major candidates are John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay from Kentucky, and Andrew Jackson from Tennessee. And the election ends up. The election ends up in the house because nobody, none of them actually gain a majority in the electoral college. Remember that in order to be elected president, you have to gain a majority in the electoral college and in the house, Adams makes a deal with Henry Clay. And that deal, essentially, is that if you give your support to me in the election, in the House, I'll make you secretary of state. Okay? It's very similar to what happened with Obama and Clinton in 2008, when Obama convinced Clinton to follow him or to give her support to him, and in return, she became secretary of state. Okay, so then what ends up happening is that. Is that the election goes to Adams. Even though Jackson had really won the popular vote, he had more votes than anybody else. So Jackson. Andrew Jackson. Keep in mind, Andrew Jackson is the hero of New Orleans, right? Is incensed, and he goes on a campaign to oust Adams from the White House in the next election, all right? He called this deal between Adams and Clay the corrupt bargain. And the idea here is that even though Jackson won the most votes, Adams became president, and it was because of this corruption, okay? And what it demonstrates to us is, in the United States called patronage. And so patronage is political favors in return for political rewards. Right? And I'm not going to really go into all this yet, just a second. But I wanted to mention that it was patronage. That it was patronage that caused the election to go to Adams. Let's think about patronage and how it works. Patronage is actually part of american politics even today, as I discussed with Jack, with Clinton and Obama. Right? And what it is is that you give somebody your political support, which represents votes, and in return, you get political favors, which is jobs. Okay? So in the case of Adams and Clay, Clay gave his support to Adams, and in return, he got secretary of state. You guys get what I'm saying Clinton gave her support to Obama and in return, she got secretary of state. You get what I'm saying here? Okay, so. So it works at that level, and it still works at that level today, right? Because all of the, all of the cabinet, like the secretary of state and secretary of treasury and all the people that Biden has just appointed in the last couple months are all serving at the pleasure of the president, right? So that means that their jobs depend on the president being in place. When the president leaves, they don't have a job anymore. Right? So, for example, secretary of state under Trump was Pompeo. When Biden became president, Pompeo is no longer secretary of state. You guys get what I'm saying? That's how it works. Okay? But what's going to happen, the thing that Jackson is going to do is he's going to mobilize all these new voters with a more expanded version of patronage. And in order for us to understand that, I want us to think about it in practical terms. Okay. And in practical terms, what we're talking about is whole neighborhoods, for example, in a city being organized to vote for a certain candidate. Okay? And this is how it happens. And this is one way that it happens anyway. That, for example, in the 1820s, there is a pretty big immigration from, say, Ireland. In the early part of the 19th century, there was a huge immigration of people from Ireland. What would happen would be that if you were an immigrant from Ireland, you more likely would be a young man, single, and you would come to a city like New York. And when you were in there, in that city, you would need a job. So you would go to the irish section of the city, and you would go to a hiring hall. And at the hiring hall, that was run by a guy who we call the boss, right? Not like, you know, bowser and Super Mario brothers, but a political boss. And you would ask the boss for a job, and the boss would give you a job, and you would work as that job on that job for the whole year until the next election. But on election day, your job was to make sure everybody got out and voted, because when everybody voted for the guy who was the police commissioner, that meant that the police commissioner could. Could allow the boss to continue to give out the police jobs. So your job as a policeman depended on the police commissioner being in office, and the police commissioner in office gave that power of jobs over to the boss. Does that make sense to you guys? Do you understand what I'm saying here? I know. I don't think I explained it very well, so, although I know what I'm talking about, I just can't get it. I can't communicate it. All right, do you guys get what I'm saying here? So if I'm an immigrant from Ireland or I'm an immigrant from anywhere, or I'm anybody, and I want a job, I go to the hiring hall. And the hiring hall. The guy who's in control of the hiring hall controls the government jobs. And the reason why he controls the government jobs is because the person who is in city official who is in charge of those jobs has given me that power in return for me delivering the votes for him. Does that make sense? You understand? I pretty much only see a bunch of blank faces. The ones I can see. Yeah, I get it. Okay. All right. So now, did any of you guys ever wonder, have you ever seen a Bugs bunny cartoon? Do you ever notice that on the Bugs bunny cartoon, the cops all have a certain accent? Whenever they have cops in a Bugs bunny cartoon, they always have certain accents. Let's watch. Okay, Clancy, take the boys and surround the house. Jiggas. Fellas, the cops. Open up. This is the police. All right, Rabbit, where's Rocky? Where's he hiding? He's not in this stove. Oh, he's hiding in the stove, eh? Would I turn on the gas if he was in there? You might, Robert. You might. Well, would I throw a lighted match in there if he was in there? Oh, no, you don't take me with you. Don't leave me with that story. I confess. I get it. I get it. Arrest me. Arrest me. So do you see that what I was talking. This is good demonstration of what I was talking about. And now you know why cops and Bugs Bunny cartoons have irish accents, right? And you thought this class was going to be a waste of time, but. So anyway, so that's the idea of patronage. And it's going to be endemic in american politics all the way through the 19th century. Okay? And you can go ahead and watch. You can go ahead and read this later on your own. The thing about it is that it creates loyalty on the part of people who are voters because their jobs are at stake. But it also creates problems. Right? And these are some of the problems that it creates. Corruption and incompetence. Right? Because people are put in positions that they're not qualified to actually perform. Okay, so at any rate, that's the issue of patronage, and it's going to become really representative of american politics. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments?
