The way that a state is created. Let me just say it this way first, okay? It has to do with the Northwest ordinance. The Northwest ordinance was enacted before the constitution actually was written by Thomas Jefferson. Right. And the idea what the Northwest ordinance did was it established a method for adding new states. Okay? And so the way that a state would be added would be that Congress would create a territory like the Ohio territory or the Indiana territory, and then they would appoint a governor to the territory. And then after that, the. The population would grow in that territory until it reached a certain level, at which point they would come together and write a constitution and apply for admission to the union. And then the Congress would say, yes, you're a part of the union, or, no, you're not part of the union. Right? You guys are following me here. Any questions about how that happens? Okay? Now, the one thing is that at this time, when you apply for admission to the union, you have to apply to be either a free state or a slave state, because there were slave states, states where slavery was. Was practiced, and that was all in the south. Okay. Or what? Basically the orange. The orange territory here, right? Okay. Or you'd be a free state. Okay. The slave states are the free states. All right? And you would have to. If you were going to. If you were going to apply for admission to the union, you would have to say, do I want to be admitted as a slave state or a free state? Okay? But now here's the situation, is that, as I mentioned to you, the free states have control of Congress, or at least part of Congress, because of the population. But do they have control of all of Congress? How can the south maintain their. Their significance in the congress? In the Senate. In the Senate, because the Senate grants equal representation to the states, right? So every state has two senators. So we could say, well, maybe New York has 30 representatives, but they only have two senators. You see what I'm saying? And maybe South Carolina has only got ten representatives, but they say they have the same number of senators. Two senators. Right? So the equality of the number of senators from free states and slave states is called parity. P a r I t y. Parity. Okay? And what the south wanted to do was to either increase the number of representative. Number of senators that they had over the number of free state senators, or at least maintain an equality, right? At least maintain parity. Because as long as they maintain parity, they had some influence over the. Over the federal government. You guys follow what I'm saying here? Questions, comments about this? All right? So when Missouri was when the Missouri applied for admission to the union, they applied for admission as a slave state. Okay? And that's. That's going to cause kind of a political crisis in Congress, because the voices of the antislave voices are really becoming louder and louder now. Abolitionism is becoming more and more important. And what ends up happening is that Congress denies Missouri's admission as a slave state. And this creates a crisis between the states because the southern states are going to say, well, if we're not going to. We can't even maintain parity in. In the Senate. We're not even going to be part of this. We're just going to leave the union. And so they come up with a compromise, the Missouri compromise. And the compromise is that Missouri will be admitted as a slave state and Maine will be admitted as a free state. Okay? Because Maine was. Before this, it was part of Massachusetts. So Maine becomes its own state and it's free state. And so what that does is it maintains parity. They have equal number of senators in the. In the south, in the slave states and free states. You guys are with me on this. Questions, comments? And then the final thing was that they drew a line, and the line was where the Missouri meets the Mississippi right here and going all the way west as far as it goes. Right all the way to the Pacific. And that line, the purpose of that line, the Missouri compromise line, is to state that no slave states can be admitted north of that line. Now, if that's true, and they did agree to that, how much territory is there for the. For the slave states to add to the union? If they want to grow their influence in the government, where can they do it? There's nowhere left for them to go, really. Exactly. Because this. This territory all belongs to, actually starts belonging to Spain and then belongs to Mexico. And all of the. All of the. Everything south of this belongs to the Spain. In fact, there's going to be a group of people from the south who are going to attempt to annex different places in Spanish America, among them Cuba, Brazil, and Nicaragua, for the purposes of creating new states. All right. They're not going to be successful. But at any rate, the point is that the compromise is a kind of a bitter concession on the part of the south, but they do remain in the union. So the Missouri compromise passes and the union survives. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. We're going to come back to this later. So I hope you guys remember what I just said. I just want to spend a couple minutes summarizing the Missouri compromise. The Missouri compromise occurred in 1820 after Missouri applied for admission to the union. Missouri was denied admission to the union as a slave state, at which point there was a crisis in which the southern states threatened to secede, and so there was a compromise that was made to save the union. The compromise was that Missouri was admitted as a slave state. Maine was admitted as a free state so that they could maintain parity, and then there was an agreement that parity would be maintained in adding new states afterwards. And then there was a limit on the extension of slave territory above the Missouri compromise line, which was a line that was essentially where the Ohio river meets the Mississippi river and going all the way west. So you can see on this little map that I'm showing you here, the Green Line is the Missouri compromise line, which turns out to be a bitter concession on the part of the southerners, because, in reality, there was no territory left south of that line that the south could organize into territories for expansion of slave influence on the national government.
