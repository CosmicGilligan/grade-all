Now, last thing I want to talk about, and this is an important thing for a number of reasons, right? But one of the reasons why the south believed that they could win the war in the beginning was because they were the major supplier of cotton to the british textile factories, and they believed that the British would try to preserve that relationship if they had to by allying with the Confederacy. Okay? And there was some. Some. They did consider it seriously, but it never happened. And the reason why was because by now, the british public is steadfastly against slavery, and Lincoln has, by now, made slavery the issue of the war. Right. He does it by this exact incident that we're going to talk about here. But we got to keep in mind that, remember that when Lincoln was elected, his promise was not to abolish slavery, but to limit slavery. And so even when we get to 1863 or even 1865, at the end of the war and after Lincoln is dead, slavery is still legal in Louisiana, Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware. These were all states that stayed in the Union even though they were slave states, and slavery was still legal in those states during the civil war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this, all right? But now Lincoln knows that if he can make the war about slavery, that will make it less likely that the British will intervene. And so what he's looking for is an opportunity to make an announcement about emancipation. Emancipation means freeing. Freeing the slaves, right? The problem is, as I mentioned to you guys, from the very beginning, most people think the south is winning, right? And so he feels that if he announces emancipation while everybody thinks the south is winning, it'll just be seen as a desperation move. Okay, so he waits until after the battle of Antietam. The battle of Antietam was, if you'll recall, the first major victory of the Union against the Confederacy. And then he announces his emancipation plan, right? His emancipation plan is that on the first day of January, 1863, all the slaves will be freed. Well, not quite. Okay, here's what it actually says. It says, on the first day of January, the year of our Lord, 1863, all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of the state. The people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward and forever free. Okay, how many slaves were freed by the emancipation Proclamation? It's an exact number. Zero. Zero. Do you see why? Do you see why the emancipation proclamation freed zero slaves crippled the south from any kind of, like. Well, yeah, it is that. Okay, you're right about that. But just think about what it says here, any state or designated part of a state the people were of shall then be in rebellion against the United States. What would that place. Where would those places be? Anybody can answer. How about Igor? In the south? Yeah, exactly. In the south. And how much authority does Lincoln's executive order have in the south? Do the southern States acknowledge Lincoln's executive orders? No. No. It would be like. It would be like if President Biden signed an order saying everybody in Mexico City gets ice cream. Right? Would that mean everybody in Mexico City gets ice cream? Who would connect? Who would, who in Mexico City would get ice cream based on Biden's order? Nobody. You follow what I'm saying here? And keep in mind that after the emancipation Proclamation, slavery continued in Kentucky and Missouri and Delaware, Maryland. Right. And Louisiana. Okay. All the way up until the 13th amendment, which is after Lincoln is already dead. Okay, so the emancipation proclamation doesn't free any slaves. Really? It practically. But what it really. What it does do is it makes slavery the issue of the civil war, and it prevents the British from actually intervening in the war. And it also, because the word gets out among the slave population in the south, it also deprives the south of labor because the slaves are going to start to desert their plantations and follow the Union army around. Okay, you guys are with me. So even though the emancipation proclamation doesn't actually free any slaves, it actually does help to bring about an end to the war. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Well, that's my story, and I'm sticking with it. Live long and prosper.
