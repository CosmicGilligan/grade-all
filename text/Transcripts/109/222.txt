The divergence in colonization motives between Virginia and New England largely centers around economic versus ideological underpinnings. Specifically, Virginia's colonization was primarily driven by economic pursuits. Conversely, New England's establishment was fundamentally influenced by ideology, with a significant emphasis on theology or religion, which itself can be viewed as a form of ideology. This delineates a clear distinction. One group of colonies emerged from a quest for economic gain, while the other was conceived from religious ideological convictions. Beyond motivations for colonization, there were significant regional geographical differences. New England's landscape sharply contrasts with that of the Virginia tidewater region. New England, characterized by its healthier environment, dense forests, and rocky soil, was ill suited for plantation agriculture. This geographical reality precluded the cultivation of tobacco or other typical plantation crops found in Virginia. Consequently, new England settlers predominantly established small family operated farms. These farms could not be sustained over time because of the inheritance practice among the protestant settlers, which differed markedly from that of their anglican or catholic counterparts. Traditionally, european inheritance through the Middle Ages was governed by the principle of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherits the entire estate, a practice that ensured the consolidation of wealth and estates within aristocratic families. However, in New England, a system of partable inheritance was adopted whereby every son received an equal share of the inheritance. To illustrate, consider an estate owned by a Catholic with seven sons. Upon his death, only the eldest son would inherit the estate, thus maintaining its unity and ensuring its perpetuation within the family. This mechanism was a cornerstone for the intermarriage among aristocracy in Europe aimed at preserving estate cohesion. In contrast, protestant settlers in New England divided an estate equally among all descendants. For example, if a settler had four sons, the estate would be subdivided into four equal parts, each son receiving a portion. This division process, repeated over generations, could eventually result in the land parcels becoming too small to sustain the families. This transition to partable inheritance had profound implications for the colonial New England economy. It fostered the development of numerous smaller farms, promoting a more egalitarian distribution of land, but also leading to challenges related to land fragmentation and sustainability. This system of inheritance, alongside the region's geographical characteristics, shaped the distinctive economic landscape of New England. Contrasting with the plantation based economy prevalent in regions like Virginia, many New Englanders are forced to seek alternative means of livelihood when they find their inherited farms too small to sustain traditional farming. Imagine being in Massachusetts during the 17th or 18th century. Faced with the dilemma of seeking financial stability without the option of farming, there was always the temptation to move west, seeking new lands. But westward expansion presented its own set of challenges, notably the presence of formidable native american nations and territories claimed by France. Given these constraints, limited farming opportunities and the complexities of moving west, many people turned their sights towards urban areas in search of employment. This shift led to the emergence of more mercantile economic activities. Timber logging surfaced as a viable industry, capitalizing on the abundant forests. This industry played a crucial role in shipbuilding, providing essential materials like masts. Consequently, shipbuilding burgeoned into a significant industry. Commercial fishing also emerged as another cornerstone of the New England economy, with Boston evolving into an important trade hub. In reality, Boston became notably central to the slave trade during much of the 18th century, with the english slave trade largely anchored in the city. Thus, we observe the development of a modernizing economy in New England, distinctly shaped by its geographical constraints and the ingenuity of its inhabitants. In adapting to these limitations, the economic development of New England mirrors similar developments toward modernization in England.
