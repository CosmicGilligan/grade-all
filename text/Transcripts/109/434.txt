So what happens then? Jackson is elected. And one of the ways we can see, I mean, one demonstration of how things change is that when politicians in Washington, politics in Washington had been controlled by elites from the very beginning, and the common people were pretty much just left out. But when, when Jackson was elected the first, on his inauguration night, he had a big party at the White House and he invited everybody over, right? He says, everybody, come on over to the White House. We're going to have a party. So the White House is filled up with all these common people, mechanics, farmers, different kinds of people. And it was chaos. It's kind of like inviting a bunch of college students to your party at your apartment. You can imagine what the place is going to look like the next day. Right? So, and this is what happened at the White House. And the only way they could get the people out was to move all the booze out on the lawn so that the people would go out to get the booze and they wouldn't let them back in. Right. But that shows this kind of movement towards a more common or more democratic atmosphere in american government. People who are, who are not elite, feeling that they have ownership in the government. You guys follow me here. Questions, comments about this? Okay, well, this is going to be shocking to the political elite, right? This is going to be something that causes a great deal of stress among the people who are the elite. And what the result of it is going to be is that the people who, people who don't have anything else in common, are you going to unite because they don't like Andrew Jackson? They want to get rid of Andrew Jackson. So they form a new party. And this new party is going to be called the Whigs. Alright? So we had, remember we had democratic Republicans and federalists before the federalist party essentially went away. Then there was no party. And now we have a new party, a new two party system with the Democrats being represented by Andrew Jackson and the Whigs being everybody who doesn't like Andrew Jackson. Right. So now, when we, remember, I think it was on Monday, we talked about the american system and we talked about how american politics was driven by regional concerns, north, south and west. Right. In this case, what we're going to see happening is that those concerns will remain. But the motivator behind the Whigs is going to be their hatred of Andrew Jackson. Right. So it's really people who really don't have anything else in common coming together and forming a party to, to oppose the man that's in power. Okay, you guys are with me questions? Comments about this? Anybody? Okay, well, so these people call themselves Whigs. Why do they call themselves that? Well, it's not because they put wigs on their head, because that's w I g. Right. Whigs are the party in England who are anti monarchy. So why would an american political party name themselves after an english political party that is anti monarchy? What monarchy? Are they against the english monarchy? No, these people, these american politicians are not against the english monarchy. What monarch are they against? An american monarch. Yeah. Which one? Andrew Jackson. King Andrew. Exactly. King Andrew. Right. So they believe that Andrew Jackson is acting like a king, and that's. That's basically their. Their political platform. Okay, questions? Comments? The last thing I want to mention about this is, do you. Does anybody. Have you ever wondered why the Democratic Party is represented by a donkey? Because Andrew Jackson, when people were. People who were opposed to Andrew Jackson, called him the jackass. Andrew Jackass. And so the jackass became the symbol of Andrew Jackson, and he was really the founder of the Democratic Party. Right. So that's why the Democratic Party has its symbol as a donkey. Okay, questions? It's still a jackass. They just don't call it that. They call it donkey instead. All right, questions? Comments about.
