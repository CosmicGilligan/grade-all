This week, we're going to start looking at the British Empire in North America, beginning with Virginia and New England. Today we'll focus on Virginia, and in the next segment, we'll turn our attention to New England. Before we do that, we need to finish the english history timeline we started last week, which will bring us pretty close to the end of the colonial period. In the previous discussion of the timeline, we ended with the English Civil War and the execution of Charles I. That conflict lasted from 1643 to 1649 and raised a critical question. Who should have the power to rule, the king or parliament? The Reformation saw England breaking away from the Catholic Church, which created a split between Protestants, particularly Anglicans and Catholics. Henry VI's break with the Catholic Church wasn't about religious beliefs. It was because he wanted a divorce. This sparked the English Reformation, which was more about political power and money than religious differences. Depending on who was king or Queen, England would swing between Protestantism and Catholicism. The reformation in Europe had set in motion religious wars between Protestants and Catholics. This religious tension played a role in leading to the English Civil war. Charles I leaned toward Catholicism and supported catholic efforts on the continent. By this time, most people were protestant and saw the Catholic Church as a great evil. When Charles ran out of his own money to support catholic causes, he was refused by parliament, which was opposed to spending money fighting against other Protestants. They also believed that the right to govern came from the people and not through divine right. When the king tried to suspend parliament and raise taxes on his own, England was torn by civil war between the king and parliament. The civil war ended with the execution of King Charles I, and the monarchy was replaced by the Commonwealth, which turned out to be quite strict. Under Oliver Cromwell, it was not a democracy. It was more like a religious dictatorship, with the government enforcing a strict religious regime. People were fined or publicly humiliated for not attending church. Shakespeare's plays were forbidden in London, what the Puritans regarded as sin, drinking, gambling, revelry, was illegal. In the end, people weren't happy with this regime, and after Cromwell died, the monarchy was brought back with Charles II. This period is known as the Restoration. In America, places like North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia are known as restoration colonies. Charleston got its name from Charles II. Charles was succeeded by James II, the Duke of York, who ruled New York for a time and after whom New York is named. James was an unpopular authoritarian who tried to assert divine right, which led to his daughter Mary and her husband, William of Orange, raising an army in 1688, which was sent to England to depose the king. This event is called the glorious revolution. It is called glorious because it was a bloodless coup. But James in exile did not relinquish his claim to the throne and set in motion decades of political turmoil in England. After William and Mary were placed on the throne by parliament, the question of who rules England was resolved. It was parliament, with the monarch reigning at the pleasure theoretically of the people, a constitutional monarchy. The political turmoil of the 18th century distracted british rule over the colonies. The period is called the era of benign or salutary neglect. The result in America was that the colonies were left to rule themselves, even though parliament still claimed sovereignty over the colonies. The effect of this will be significant when we come to the causes of the american revolution. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.
