So let's go in and move into what we were going to talk about today, and that is the so called era of good feelings. What was the last thing we talked about? Was it Andrew Jackson? Jackson going against the british army and winning? Okay. All right. And what was that event called? It was the war of something. 1812 or. Yeah, the war of 1812. Do you remember? Were all the states in favor of the war? Were all the regions in favor of the war? I want you to start thinking about the United States now for the next few lectures in terms of regions. Right. And the regions are the north, the south and the west. All right, so north would be New England and New York. And that area, the south would be all of the plantation states, essentially, the slavocracy, as they call it. And then the west would be like, for example, what we would think of today is Illinois. Iowa. Not Iowa, but Illinois and Ohio, Indiana. Those places in there. Right. So we were north, south and west. Tennessee would also be west. When we think about those three regions, were they all in favor of the war? Who were the Americans fighting against in the War of 1812? The British. The British, exactly. So now, was everybody in the United States, were all three regions on board with going to war against the British, or was there one region that was not in favor of that? What was that region? The north. Why the north? How about Danny? Danny, tell me why the northeast was opposed to going to war against the British. Wouldn't one of the reasons be because most of their money come from, like, international trade with the Brits? That's exactly right, Dan. So the northeast was against the war with the British. Right. And do you guys remember, um. In fact, tell me about the Hartford convention. They said that if they weren't going to pull out of the war, then that they would pull out of the Union. Exactly. They threatened to secede from the Union. So that shows the feeling of the. Of the people in the northeast, how strong their feelings were against being at war with their major trading ally. Right. Okay, so now, when did the United States win or lose the war? Well, I mean, it's kind of split down the middle because, I mean, they won in theory, but not really because the country still was divided. Okay. The way we would have to say it is you're on the right track, is that the United States didn't win the war, but they didn't lose the war either. Right. They kind of went back to the way it was before, which we call the status quo ante. Ante means before. Right. Okay, so the status quo ante, the way it was before. So in reality, the best that the Americans could say was that they didn't lose the war. But did Americans think they had won the war? Yeah. Yeah. And why was that? Anybody can answer. I'm done picking on Jacob. Anybody can answer. Did. Why did Americans believe they had won the war even though they. The best they could say was that they didn't lose the war. It had to do with the treaty. The people heard about the treaty. It was the treaty of ghent. Right. But they heard about something else before the treaty. Something happened, actually, even after the war was already over, theoretically. Right. But they heard about that first in the east, before they heard about the treaty. It's kind of what we were just, we started off talking about. Was it about General Andrew Jackson? Uh huh. Andrew Jackson. And what did he do? He, like, achieved a, like, victory in what battle? You're absolutely right. In the battle of New Orleans. Exactly. The battle of New Orleans. Jackson wins this really enormous victory over the british army after the war is already over because remember that the treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, but the battle didn't happen until January 12, or I think something like that of 1815. At any rate, he wins the battle against a much superior british force. And people in the east hear about Jackson winning this war against the. Against the British, and the next thing they hear is that there's a treaty, a peace treaty, right. And so Americans are convinced that they've won the war. Right. And there's this wave of patriotism that kind of erupts in the nation, if you guys will. Remember, when we read about the book about the constitution and when people started to really pay attention to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution was after the war of 1812, during this war, this wave of patriotism. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so now that being said, if the United States sees itself as the big winner and the northeast, the people in the northeast are seen, have been against the war, how does that make the rest of the country feel about the people in the northeast? What are the people in the northeast? They threatened to secede from the war, from the Union. They actually pulled their troops out of the war and threatened to secede, and we won anyway. So how do people feel about people from the northeast? Like traitors. Treason. Exactly. There are a bunch of traitors. They're chumps. Right. And now let's think about what political party was dominant in the northeast. The Federalists. Exactly. The Federalists. So what ends up happening then is that the victory in the war of 1812 brings about the end of the federalist party, right? Because the Federalists are seen. Federalists were actually governing in New England at the time of the war, and the Federalists were seen as chumps and traitors. And so the federalist party disappears, essentially. Right? It doesn't disappear, but, I mean, it ends. And so you guys will remember we talked about the first party system. The first party system was the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans. But the federalist party is going to fade away after the war of 1812. So we go into a period of about 20 years where there aren't parties, right? Essentially, everybody's in the same party, the Democratic Party or the Democratic Republicans, right? And because of that, there isn't a lot of political wrangling in terms of political partisanship. Right. And that's one of the reasons why they call this the era of good feelings, is that there's not a lot of political sniping. But it doesn't mean that there aren't any divisions, okay? Because the divisions that are evident at this point in time are not between political parties, but between regions. Okay? And remember that I told you that there were three regions just a few minutes ago. What are the three regions? Somebody tell me. The north, the south and the west. North, south and west. All right? So this is what I just talked about here. The first thing here.
