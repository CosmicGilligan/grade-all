All right, well, now, there's different groups of natives living in the Americas that the Spanish will encounter. As I already mentioned to you, the Spanish encountered the natives in the Caribbean first, who were a subsistence economy, and then later they would actually, they encountered the Mayans first. But their main advance, I guess, or aggression, you could say, was against this group of natives here, which we call the Aztecs. And if you look at, it's hard to see on this slide, but if you look on this map here or this map down here, the purple area is designated the aztec empire. All right, well, that's a misnomer in many different ways. Okay? So the first thing is that the group that is dominant in this area are called Mexico. And that's where we get the word Mexico. And the reason why they're dominant is because they were at one time a group of outsiders. Because what you'll see on this map, you see the colored area is the civilized area, and the yellow area here is the really non sedentary area. Okay? There are some civilizations up here, but for looking at the spanish empire, we'll look at this part. This area had been civilized for a long time. And if you look at this area here, you'll see. And again, it's very difficult to see on this screen, but there are a number, really, there are hundreds, almost 700 different cities in this area. And they're like the city states of ancient Greece. So each one has its own leader and its own rule set, its own culture, its own politics, its own gods, right? There's a common culture among all of these based on the language. And the language is Nawat, which is a language that's still spoken in Mexico, in the center of Mexico, because this whole area, what really unified this area wasn't politics. It was the language, right? The language and the culture, the set of gods and that sort of thing that went with it. And it's called Nawat, based on the Nawat language. Okay? So all of these little different city states had in common. It's very much like in Europe. If we think about Europe at this know, there was England and there was France, and there was Germany, and there was Spain, and each one of those little areas was divided up into a bunches and bunches of other little areas, and they all had their own languages and their own dialects. But there was a common language, the language, Latin, that all of the people spoke in common. That's called the langua franca. And that's what we see here. There's all these different little political areas, but they all have the one language in common. So each group would speak their own language plus nawat. Does that make sense to you guys? Okay. Now, when the Meshika, they were among the non sedentary people who moved into this area, they were interlopers. And the reason why this area was a target for the so called non civilized people was because this is where all the wealth was. Right? So if you could get into this area, you could take stuff. And in order to do that, obviously you had to be very warlike. And the Meshika were okay. And so they moved in here. They were not wanted. They were not welcomed by the other groups in the area. And so they were essentially consigned to an area in the middle of a lake in the valley of Mexico. And in that, what they did was they actually built a city on the lake. The name of the city was Tenochtitlan. And the center of Tenochtitlan is where the center of Mexico City is today. Right? So that whole area in the center of Mexico. I don't know if you guys have ever been to Mexico City, but there's an area called the Socalo, which is a square, a great square in the middle of the city that was underwater originally. And there's actually, if you're down there, they have a poll outside the national cathedral that shows where the water level was. So all that was underwater. But the natives built that up. The Meshika built that up. And then, being very warlike, they became dominant among the Nawat. Not by creating a land empire like we would think of it. Like, for example, in the Roman Empire, at this height of the roman empire, they built a wall, and they said, okay, everything on this side of the wall is the roman empire. Everything on the other side is not the roman empire. Instead of that, what the Meshika did was they essentially were shakedown artists. They would go to the different cities with their armies, and they would say, okay, let's make a deal. You pay up and we won't kill you. Right? Essentially. Right. And so what would happen would be then that they would subdue a city by demanding tribute. And then if the city agreed to pay the tribute, then they would be left alone except for collection of the tribute. The tribute would be like turquoise and cacao beans and gold and things like that. But the main point here is that as long as they paid up, they were free to do whatever they wanted. So they didn't have a sense of a unified nation. They didn't really owe allegiance to the Meshika. They just had to pay so you can imagine that that kind of a situation will lead to a lot of resentment because essentially what the Aztecs or the meshika were, were tax collectors, and nobody likes the tax collector. Right. And there wasn't any sense of unity among these different groups when the Spanish came. What they found was that there were a lot of unhappy subjects of the Aztecs or the meshika, and they could exploit that to bring about the fall of the meshika, which we'll talk a little bit about more in a few minutes. You might wonder why they're called Aztecs. And the reason why is because in the 19th century, there was a german scholar, I guess you could say, Alexander von Humboldt, and he theorized that the place where the natives came from, the meshika, was called Astlan. And nobody actually knows where Astlan was. That's what the natives themselves said, that they came from Asthlan. But if they came from Asthlan, then that would mean that they were azteca. Right. Ozlan leads to azteca. Okay, so that's where we get the word aztec. But nobody called them Aztecs until the 19th century. Well, okay, so there's two other groups we're going to talk about. The next group also is united by language, the Mayans. They're only united by language. And that's one of the things that's accurate about this map. If you look at the map, it says that it calls this the mayan cultural area. And what was is there were 52 different groups of natives in here who all spoke a similar language, Mayan. But they were always at war with each other. They were constantly at war with each other. And not only that, when the Spanish came, they found cities, but really nobody was living in them. And the question then becomes, well, were they not living in the cities because these cities were just for ceremonial purposes, or did they at one time live in the cities and then move out? And we don't really know the answer to that. But the second one probably is closer to the truth, because in the cities, they were vulnerable. And so what they did was they were driven out into the countryside where they could evade marauding armies from the other cities. Right. The main point here is that the Mayans were very warlike, very hostile. They were hostile to the Spanish and they were hostile to each other, and they would remain that way all the way up into the 19th century. All right, questions? Comments? If anybody says anything about the mayan empire, there was never a mayan empire. Okay. The Mayans were always divided, and the Spanish were able to take advantage of that. All right, then, lastly, we have the Inca of Peru. The Inca were different from the Mesoamericans because they actually were an empire like the Roman Empire. And what had happened within basically the last hundred years before the Spanish arrived was that a group of natives was able to conquer and unify all of this. And the strength of this was that everybody was acculturated into the Inca empire, which meant that everybody owed allegiance to the great Inca. But the problem with that was that all of the authority was located in the person of the great Inca, who at the time of the spanish arrival, was Atajualpa. What that meant was that whatever the Inca said, everybody had to do and what would end up happening is that Spanish, under Pisaro, will take Atawalpa hostage and force him to order the delivery of gold. And that's going to be essentially because they control the authority, they are able to control the empire. And so this mighty huge empire essentially will fall under the dominion of the Spanish because they were able to take away the leader. All right, so this is what we see the Spanish encountering when they come to America.
