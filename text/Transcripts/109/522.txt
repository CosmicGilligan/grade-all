Now, let's take a look at the two different sides here. The north. Again, the interest of Abraham Lincoln was to save the union in terms of resources. They had a larger population. They had an industrial economy, a booming industrial economy. They had industry. They could, they could manufacture things like guns and uniforms and stuff like that. And they had all the materials they needed because they controlled the west and they had the mines in Nevada and in California. And so the north had every advantage going into the war. Just like at the beginning of the American Revolution, the British had every advantage going into the war. Okay? So the strategy for the north is going to be, let's just crush them. Let's build a huge army and just crush them. And so the plan that was put in place to defeat the south at the beginning of the war was called the Anaconda plan. The anaconda is a snake, as you guys may or may not know. And the way that it kills its prey is by squeezing them to death. Right? So the idea here was that we were going to blockade the south to keep them from trading, to get money for their war effort. And at the same time, there's going to be an invasion in the west and in the east. Okay? And the idea then is to squeeze the life out of the south. That's the, that's the strategy of that, that Lincoln approved at the beginning of the war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. The problem with this is that Lincoln could not find a general to carry out his plan. And the reason for that is because the generals in the army generally were more concerned about politics than they were about winning battles. Every, all the generals in the army thought that they, or hoped that they would have a political future. And they all knew from the experience of George Washington and Andrew Jackson that the way to gain popularity is by winning battles. But the way to lose popularity is by losing battles. So they were very cautious. They did not want to fight any battles that they might lose because that would hurt their political chances. You guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? And so the result then is that Lincoln can't get the generals to execute his plan. And I'm going to show you how that works here in just a few minutes. All right. All right. So now the south, they're at every disadvantage, right? They, they have less population. Much of the population is enslaved. They don't have very much industry. There's a little bit of industry in Alabama and in Virginia. And so they're at a, they're, they're at a numerical and a strategic disadvantage. But they're fighting for their homes. One of the things that we need to keep in mind is that most of the civil war happened in the south, and that means that people were fighting to defend their homes. And it's more motivating to fight for something that's real right in front of you than it is to say, march 1000 miles from Iowa to Georgia to fight against somebody who we don't even really know what they're fighting for. Right? So the southern armies were much more motivated. Okay? And then they faced the superiority of the north or encouraged themselves with the idea that George Washington had won a war against an even greater enemy. And the reason why, according to their thinking, was because they were in the right. Okay? And the south, what we need to really understand about the south is that they believed they were on the right side. They believed they. That the issue of the abolition of slavery or the limiting of slavery was a. Was a violation of sacred property rights. Okay? And I don't know if you guys noticed, but I gave you extra credit. Right? Did you guys see the extra credit I put up? That's due next week? And there's no late, there's no late submissions on the extra credit. Right? But the extra credit talks of it. What it shows you is the declarations of causes, which is like the declarations of Independence, the southern states, okay? And each one of those calls out as a reason for secession that their rights as states had been violated by the national government or was going to be violated by the national government. Okay? And so that's where we can. We can get the. The assertion that the civil war was all about states rights. But you don't have to look very far to realize that the right that they were defending was the right to own people as property. You see what I'm saying? So you can't separate states rights from slavery. People today will say, oh, yeah, well, the south wasn't fighting to keep the slaves. The south was fighting to preserve their rights. Well, what rights? The rights to keep slaves. Right? So when people try to divert your attention from slavery as a. As the cause of the civil war, it's just smoke. They're blowing smoke. Slavery is at the very root of the cause of the civil war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? I'm gonna talk a little bit more about that in just a second. But at any rate, the point here then, is that the strategy that the south tried to implement was to just keep the war going, drag the war out, because the longer the war dragged on, the less interested people in the north were in fighting it. And that's really what had happened with the American Revolution, that the Americans just wouldn't give up. And eventually the british people said, we don't want this anymore. Just give up. And so that's going to be their strategy. And it almost works, as we're going to see before the end of today. Okay? Now, I want to just say one thing about the relationship between slavery and racism, okay? Because in the United States, slavery was race based. There were certain places. I mean, white slavery was unheard of in the United States, and. And there were places in the United States where you could not be black and not be a slave, okay? So slavery is absolutely race based in the United States, okay? Which kind of muddies the waters when we talk about racism, because we've come to think that if you're against slavery, that means you're also against racism. But this is not true, okay? That even though many people in the north now are seeing slavery as a moral evil, that doesn't mean that they recognize slaves as their equals. And in fact, most white people everywhere, the United States, see themselves as superior to black people, okay? And so when we talk about abolishing slavery, it's not necessarily true that we mean to make former slaves equal in terms of civil rights, okay? There. There were many people who believed that slavery was a moral evil, but couldn't imagine that these slaves could become equal citizens. And even Lincoln went through a phase like that where Lincoln said slavery was wrong, but he could never imagine the former slaves as being equal to white people. So his solution was to send them back to Africa. What's the problem with sending them back to Africa? Most of them have been born here, right? Yeah. They're not from Africa. They're born here. Right? That's why the 15th amendment says that in order to be a citizen, you have to be born in the United States, right? If you're born in the United States, then you're a citizen. It's for that reason that makes all of the slaves, the former slaves, citizens. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this? Okay, well, here's. Here's the thing. So anyway, the point here is then that when we talk about the animosity between the north and the south, this animosity isn't really an issue of race. It's an issue of union and property rights, okay? And those property rights center on the issue of ownership of human beings, right? And. But. And so we could say that maybe in the north. The north. People in the north were anti slavery, and people in the south were pro slavery. But in fact, generally speaking, people in the north couldn't care less about slavery. They wanted to preserve the union, and people in the south also could. Most people didn't own slaves, but they became convinced that the national government was violating states rights. Okay, you guys follow I'm saying here, but we can say that there was an equal amount of racism across the country. It's not like people in the north were not racist and people in the south were racist. Everybody was racist, okay? And that's going to be true all the way into the 20th century. Think about this. In 1952, I think, let's say 1947, Jackie Robinson was the first black player in the major leagues, right? Well, was that the southern major leagues or was that the american major leagues? You guys get what I'm saying here? And in 1952, Harry TRuman's integrated the armed services. Was that the southern armed services or was that the american armed services? You guys follow what I'm saying here? So slavery is. I mean, racism is something that's very american. It's not just in the south. Okay, you guys are all with me. Questions, comments about this. Okay? So now, the one thing about when the war started was that people in the north and the south, if there's some kind of an insanity that goes through people's minds when a war, when there's a prospect of a war, that it's going to be something really good. It's going to be really glorious. We're going to go and we're going to fight, and it's going to be like, we're going to go have a football game, and at the end of the football game, we. We're all going to gain glory, and that's going to make our lives so much better. But in fact, war is a destroyer, and it's not until you're in it that you realize how bad that it is. But there was a lot of enthusiasm, both in the north and the south, for signing up and going to war. Okay? Now, one last thing I want to do here before we move on is I want to. This slide I put together really, I think, encapsulates the differences between the north and the south that lead to the war. We've already seen this quote by John Calhoun from the south where he's saying that, that there is no. There's going to be no compromise on the issue of slavery. Right? And now this is something that you may or may not have ever heard from Abraham Lincoln where he said, this is actually toward the beginning of the war, I would save the union. I would save it in the shortest way under the constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the union will be to the union as it was. If there be those who would not save the union unless they could, at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the union unless they could, at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the union without freeing any slave, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. So now, what is Lincoln saying here? That all he really cares about is saving the union? He doesn't really care about slavery. So slavery is not his issue. His issue is union. He won't compromise on that. But the south won't compromise on the issue of slavery. Okay, you guys are with me. So this is actually just a couple of days before his death, before he was assassinated, he summed up the civil war this way. Both parties deprecated war. I mean, we thought it was a bad thing. Both parties deprecated war. But one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came.
