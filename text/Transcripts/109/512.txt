This is going to be another instance of when the southern states are going to threaten to secede from the union. Okay. Because they're going to say, well, let's. Let's go back and remember, why is it that the slave states were so adamant about adding new slave states? Why did the south. Because it helped them. It helped them politically and also economically. Well, politically is mostly the thing. Right. You're right. The idea here is that if you add new states, then you add new representatives and you add new senators. Right. And remember that one of the outcomes of the Missouri compromise was what was called parity. P a r I t y. What is parity? I might be a tad bit wrong, but isn't it like, kind of like the idea that, you know, they wanted some. The same representation that the non slave states were getting in the government. Right. Exactly. You're absolutely right. What part of the government did the south have? Have parity in legislative. Right. Which part of the legislative delegates. Almost. Try it again. Senators. Right. Because remember, they have an equal number of representatives from. In the Senate from each state, but a different number of representatives. Right. And the problem that the south had was that the population of the north was growing and the population of the south was stagnant. So that meant that the north was getting more and more representation in the House, but they could maintain parity in the Senate. Right. It's kind of like the Senate the way it is today. Right. With even split between the number of senators. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right. Okay. So now the idea then, that slavery can't advance into this new territory is going to break the government and the south is going to threaten to secede. So a number of people come together and they work on a compromise. And I want to talk about the four different approaches to solving the problem that were evident in this. In this compromise that came about as a result of the Wilmot proviso. And the first, there's basically four different people in american government at the time. All right. So Henry Clay, who was from Kentucky, said that what was really important was the union, and that in order to save the union, if you had to allow the expansion of slavery, that was fine. Okay. So Henry Clay said, we don't care if slavery expands or maybe we don't like it, but we think that the saving the union is more important, and so we should compromise on that issue. That's going to be one point of view. Okay, guys, with me, the next one, John Calhoun. We've already heard of John Calhoun. Before. Right. What do we know from John about John Calhoun? He thought that bringing in the Mexicans would ruin everything and weaken the United States. Okay. That's true. Okay. That is the last time we heard about him. We also heard about him when he was talking about how after South Carolina had passed its nullification, ordinance of nullification, that the south could see from the union if the union was imposing policies that were bad for the state or they wouldn't have to follow it. So that was back in the 1830s. And what we said was that John Calhoun, who was from. Does anybody remember what state he was from? Because I said this state that he was from was the kind of poster child for the white supremacist secessionist outlook of the South. South Carolina. Exactly. South Carolina. So John Calhoun is right there on the screen from South Carolina. Right. And he says that the issue of slavery is states rights, and that if basically the way that the people in the south think about this or not everybody but most people, many people think about this, is that the issue of slavery isn't an issue of morality. It's an issue of property. Okay. And if we'll recall going back to the american revolution, what is the purpose of government? To protect property. Property. Exactly. So when we read Locke, Locke said that if the government. If the purpose of government is to protect property and the government doesn't protect your property, but instead takes it away from you, what should you do? Rebel. Rebel. You should get rid of that government and establish a new government. And that was the. The justification for the american revolution. That's what we read about in the Declaration of Independence. Right. You guys are all with me. Okay, so what. What John Calhoun and the people of south are saying, that slaves are not people. Slaves are property. And that if the federal government is trying to limit our ability to own property or to take our property away from us, then we have a right to change the government. And the precedent was the american revolution. You guys follow what I'm saying here? This makes sense to you guys. So then, from Calhoun's point of view, there can be no compromise on the issue of slavery. And here's one place where he said it. It was in the Senate. Right. The south has no compromise to offer but the constitution and no concession or surrender to make. She has already surrendered so much that she has little left to surrender. Such a settlement would go, the settlement says, allowing slave states. Right. Such a settlement would go to the root of the evil and remove all cause of discontent. By satisfying the south that she could remain honorably and safely in the union by abandoning any limit or any attempt to limit or restrict slavery, and thereby restore the harmony and fraternal feelings between the sections which existed anterior to the Missouri agitation, which is Missouri compromise. Nothing else can with any certainty, finally and forever settle the question at issue. Terminate agitation, which means the threat to terminate slaver, to end slavery or abolish slavery or limit slavery and save the union. Okay, so this is part of that debate that we're talking about in 1850. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions, comments about this. All right, so now let's go back and what was Henry Clay's idea? How should we solve the problem? Compromise. Compromise. What is John Calhoun's solution? No. Compromise. Don't compromise. Exactly. Now, there's another guy, Daniel Webster, who's from Massachusetts, and he's going to say it's very important to save the union, and that the way to do that is not to legislate on slavery. Let. Let slavery go wherever it will, because it won't go everywhere. Right. So, for example, if you think about the purpose, the use of slavery in the south, what was slavery used for? Plantations. Plantations. Exactly. So now, how many plantations, how many cotton plantations do you think they're going to set up in the California mountains or in the Arizona desert? They're not, right? So what Webster says is, well, where the places where it could go, it might go, but where it can't go, it won't go. There's a natural limit to where slavery will be useful. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? So that's his input, I guess, to the conversation. And then the last guy you may have heard of, Stephen Douglas, senator from Illinois, he had you. You may. Where you had heard of him before was from the Lincoln Douglas debates. He had a famous series of debates with Abraham Lincoln, but his idea is popular sovereignty. Okay, so popular sovereignty means let the people decide. Okay, so if we make a new territory, and the people that move into the territory apply for statehood as a slave state, then if they chose that, we should allow that. Right? This is the most american point of view. The most american point of view is let the people decide. If they want slavery, that's fine. If they don't want slavery, that's fine, too. You guys get what I'm saying? It seems like the most american point of view. The problem, we're going to see what the problem is in a few minutes. But now let's look at how they finally compromised is called the compromise of 1850. Why do you think they call it the compromise of 1850? Because it happened in 1850. Because it happened in 1850. Good. All right. So now here's what they call the compromise is the compromise is there's a new fugitive slave law. Now. Let me just talk briefly about the fugitive slave law. The fugitive slave law was a law that made it illegal to assist a slave who had escaped from their master in the south, right? So now the way that it was viewed by the south was that slaves were property and that if somebody helped a slave escape, that was assisting in grand theft. Okay? Keeping in mind that the price of a slave was equivalent to what we would think of as the price of a car today, right? So what they're saying is that, well, this slave is my property, and if you try to help my property to escape, which is kind of odd for us to think about it, the car tries to escape by itself because you're a bad driver. Right. And somebody helps the car, somebody drives it, let's say, right, then you're assisting in grand theft. That makes sense to you guys? So that's the way the south looked at it. The north. Many people in the north. Now, not a lot, not everybody, but a lot of people in the north are starting to think of slavery as a moral evil, right? And so there is no compromise on a moral evil. But if we're thinking about slaves as property, then we have to say, well, okay, that if somebody helps my property to escape, then they should be prosecuted. That's what the fugitive slave law was. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? And they had had one before, but it wasn't really enforced very well. So the southern states were demanding that the north enforce this law vigorously. Okay, you guys with me? Questions? Comments? All right, so that's one. Ask one. One of the issues of the compromise, the next one. California is admitted as a free state. California had already formed a government and asked for admission as a free state, but its admission to the union was actually held up by this debate over the inclusion of the territory. But California then is admitted as a free state. And New Mexico and Utah, these two territories here, are to be admitted by popular sovereignty. What does that mean again? They get to popular vote, right? Let the people decide. Okay. And then they fixed the western boundary of Texas. If you guys remember the map that I showed you last week, Texas believed that their territory went all the way up into here, but the Congress fixed the western boundary of Texas to where it is today, which is basically where Mexico had fixed the boundary between Texas and New Mexico. Right? And then. And then they abolished the slave trade in Washington DC, but not slavery, which means that you can own a slave in Washington DC, but you can't buy and sell slaves in Washington DC. Okay, you guys are with me. So that's their compromise. And the compromise actually works to keep the union together for another ten years or so.
