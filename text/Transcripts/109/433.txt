Okay, so let's keep going and let's think about. Okay, we're telling this bigger story of Jackson, and he's angry at Adams because of the corrupt bargain. He has an ally named Martin Van Buren, who also will later be president himself. But what they do is they start a new process of organizing the vote. Call it grassroots organizing, but it's organizing based on patronage, just like I had, just like I demonstrated to you guys. So they would organize a whole neighborhood, say, for example, in New York. Right, or anywhere but, say New York. And the neighborhood would be organized. Everybody in that neighborhood is going to vote for Jackson. And this is a new way of doing american politics. And the opposition wasn't ready to meet the challenge. And so the result is going to be that Jackson wins the presidency in 1828. And his win, we could say, really, he is the first truly democratically elected president in the United States because he had been able to mobilize all these new votes. He wasn't just elected by the elites. You guys get what I'm saying? All right. Okay. So. And that's going to actually end up showing in american politics, because Jackson becomes actually is the first american populist president. All right, so here's another term we need to think about. What's populism? And populism essentially is when you have a strong candidate who identifies with the common people, and because the common people are so loyal to him and so supportive of him, he is able to defy conventional norms. Right? So, for example, one of the things that we'll see, you probably already saw if you watch that video, 500 nations, is that Jackson, the supreme Court ruled that moving the Cherokee from Georgia was unconstitutional, but Jackson ignored the constitution. Why could he do that? The reason why was because he was so popular, nobody could do anything about it. You see what I'm saying? So populism, let's just take a look at it here. Populism, like I said, populists identify with an appeal. The common man. Populists are anti elite, anti big business. The United States has had two populist presidents before. Donald Trump, Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt. Populist presidents rely on popular support to circumvent constitutional restrictions. As I already mentioned, Jackson and the Cherokee. And also Theodore Roosevelt basically defied Congress and took the Panama Canal from Venezuela, I think was warned it. But at any rate, the point here is there's two different kinds of populism. There's a kind of a. An authoritarian populism and a democratic populism. Right? Authoritarian populism. Is the election of a strong man. I'm going to fix it, right? And so when he's elected or that person is elected, that person is expected to fix all the problems. Right? And then the democratic populist is somebody who says, well, I'm not going to fix all the problems. We're all going to do it together. It's a kind of a communal thing. So there's really two different approaches to populism or two different manifestations of it, okay? But either way, you end up with the same situation. Right? So when we look at, for example, in 2016, where were two candidates who were running, Donald Trump for the Republicans and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats, both of them were populists. Okay? But they were, their approach was very different. You follow what I'm saying? So, so essentially, Andrew Jackson was the result. If Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders had a baby, he would be. He would be that, because he was both, he was both a strong man, but he had this kind of popular appeal. You guys are with me on this. Questions, comments?
