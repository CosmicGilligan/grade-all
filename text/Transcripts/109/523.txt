Let's talk about the war itself. And the first thing we want to really try to understand is why the war lasted so long if the north had such a great advantage. And it has to do with military leadership. As I mentioned to you before, Lincoln could not find generals who would win battles for him. Right? So one way that I've heard it described, and I think it's a good way to think about it, is to think about the military leadership of the north and south in terms of high school football. Okay? So in high school football, you have an a team and a b team or the varsity team and the JV team, something like that. You guys are with me. Right? You understand what I'm saying? Okay. And so the a team is a good team that fights the other a teams. Right. Or plays. I'm sorry. And the B team is the not so good team, but they play the other b teams, and they're all kind of on the same level. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? But in the civil war, the Union and the Confederacy both had an a team and a b team. Right? And the Union a team was Grant and Sherman. Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. Okay. And the Confederate a team was Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jackson. Okay. The Union B team was a bunch of different generals. We'll talk a bit about each one of these in a few minutes. Right. McClellan, Burnside, hooker, and Meade. Right. And the Confederate B team was another set of lesser generals. Albert Sidney, Johnson, John Bell, Hood, and there's a number of others. Right. But what you'll notice is that the Civil War is fought in two theaters. Let me just show you here. And I'm not talking about movie theaters. Right. But let's say. Let's take a look at this one right here. Right there. This is the western theater here. Right. And this is the eastern theater here. Right? So you can see that most of the battles that are fought in the eastern theater are fought in Virginia, and most of the battles that are fought in the western theater are fought in Tennessee and Georgia. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, now what we saw happen at the beginning of the war was that the Union A team was in the west, and the Confederate B team was in the west. And the Confederate a team was in the east. And the Union B team was in the east. All right? So we have a mismatch in leadership. Okay? In the west, the north has the advantage, the Union has the advantage, and in the east, the Confederacy has the advantage. Right. You guys get what I'm saying here? But now, where do most of the people in the United States live in 1861? In the north. In the east, or in the west? In the east. In the east. Exactly. All right. So. So that means that people are going to know a lot about what's going on in the east and they're not going to know as much about what's going on in the west. You follow what I'm saying here? And so what happens is, because the Confederacy is winning a number of battles in the east, people in both the north and the south will believe that the south is winning the war. All right? And even though the Union is winning enormous battles in the west, people don't realize that. Right? So up until 1863, with the battle of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, most people believed that the south was winning the war and couldn't be beaten. Okay? And that's one of the reasons why the war kept dragging on is because people believe that they were fighting a defensive war rather than an offensive war in the north, I should say.
