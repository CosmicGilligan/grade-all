So now let's talk about the political parties here. Okay. And you guys will remember that the first party system was democratic Republicans Jefferson and Federalist Hamilton, and that the federalist party lost influence after the war of 1812 because the federalists were in New England and they were against the War of 1812. And the Americans won the War of 1812, right? Yes. Americans thought they had won the war. Why did they think they had won the war? It has to do with two things. The Treaty of Ghent and the battle of New Orleans. So what was the Treaty of Ghent? It was the peace treaty that ended the war. Okay. And what was. What was the. What was the settlement? Who won? Who won what? Who won? Who lost what? Everything stayed the same at the end. Exactly. So that means that the United States didn't win, but it didn't lose. Right. Americans thought they won because what did they hear about before they heard about the treaty? I just told you what it was. Andrew Jackson won the battle of New Orleans. Exactly. So they thought that was the thing that ended the war and that the Americans had won. And that leads to the era of good feelings, as we talked about before. Right. So, anyway, because the federalists had been against the war, then they really lost influence after the war was over. And then there was a period of time when there wasn't any party system until Andrew Jackson comes along, and then there's going to be two parties. The Democrats were kind of the original democratic Republicans. Kind of. Right. And the Whigs. And do you guys remember who the Whigs are now? This is not that long ago, and it has absolutely everything to do with Andrew Jackson. Who are the wigs? So Andrew Jackson was a very popular politician in Washington. Right? I mean, the establishment political establishment really loved him. Right? No, they hated him. So they formed this new party called the Whigs. Remember that? The Whig party was the party in England that was anti monarchy. So now we have an american political party that's named after an anti monarchy party in England. Why would they name themselves that? Which monarchy are they against? The american monarchy? Which was. Who was the king? Andrew Jackson. King Andrew. Exactly. All right, so, so then what really binds the wigs together? They come from the north and from the south and from the west. And the thing that really binds them together is what? Their hatred over Andy Jackson. Right. They hate Jackson. Okay, so now we're in the 1850s. Where's Jackson? Dead. He's dead. Exactly. So what's going to hold the Whig party together? Well, nothing really. Nothing, really. And keep in mind then, that american politics wasn't really party politics, it was really regional politics. Right. North, south and west. So there's northern Whigs, southern Whigs. Right. And western Whigs and the northern Whigs and southern Whigs are. They were united in their. In their opposition to Jackson, but they're divided in everything else having to do with tariffs and, you know, National bank and things like that. Right. So by the time we get to the 1850s, the Whig party is still there, but it just doesn't have any. Any cohesion, I guess you could say. And there's a number of other parties that are going to appear at this time. One of them is going to be called the american party, and one of the groups. One of you guys groups is working on irish immigration. Right. And the american party was formed as a political party to oppose immigration from Ireland and to oppose Catholicism. Right. Okay, so. So it's kind of a prelude to what we see today. But at any rate, the point here is that there's really. The political situation is in turmoil, I guess you could say. So, in 1854, a bunch of northern Whigs come together and form a new party called the Republican Party, named after the democratic Republicans. Right. And their main organizing issue is going to be to limit the expansion of slavery. Okay. Now, it's not to get rid of slavery. They don't say they're going to get rid of slavery. They say they're going to limit the expansion of slavery, which means that slavery can continue to exist where it does exist, but it won't be allowed anywhere else in the future. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Now, one of the reasons why is because one of the new political parties that helped to form the republican party was a. Was a political party from New York called the Free Soil Party. And the free soil party was in favor of what? Free soil. Right. Meaning that we won't add any more slave territory. Okay, so the thing that we want to keep in mind now is that the major issue of the Republicans, actually, they have two issues. Their main concern is to be the supporters of big business and commerce, but their other issue is going to be the limiting the expansion of slavery. So on the one hand, they're going to be the party of big business, and that's where the republican party is today, or has been. Right. And on the other hand, they're going to be the socially liberal party, actually more like socially radical. Right. And if you think about today, right, the Republicans in 1854 would be like the progressive wing of the Democratic Party today. You guys are with me. So we'll see how that all changes later. But the point here is that the Republican Party is the party of big business, but it's also the party of social reform. And that reform has to do with limiting the expansion of slavery. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so in 1856, there's a presidential election. The election is between John Fremont, who was an army officer, who had come to California, was president at the Bear flag rebellion, and he's going to run as the republican candidate. Millard Fillmore is the american party candidate. I already told you what the american party stood for. What was that again? The other name for this party was the know nothing party. Right. And the reason why is if you ask them what they believed in, say they'd say, I know nothing. Right. Kind of like Sergeant Schultz. So what was it that they were in favor of, and what was it they were against? I just told you not even five minutes ago. Remember, we talked. I talked earlier about irish immigration. I said, one of your projects is about irish immigration. Right? Were they for or against irish immigration? Against it. Against. And why were they against it? Too many people were coming over, and they were flooding the job market. Okay? That's part of their taking away our jobs. That's part of it. Plus, they talked funny, and they were Catholic. Right? And Americans. Many Americans believe that catholicism was against Americanism because Americans. Because Catholics theoretically obey the pope, right? Okay. So the american party would be really the first example of what we would call a nativist party. Have you guys heard of nativism? There's, like, a couple weeks ago, there's a congresswoman from, I think, Florida. I'm not sure where she's from, but she proposed to start a new caucus in Congress called the America first caucus. And the America first caucus was based on the idea that America should be ruled by anglo saxon political traditions. Is there a problem with that? What do you guys think? We're made up of a lot more than that. Okay? So if you want to restrict Americanism or restrict being american to anglo saxon peoples, who, by the way, were illegal immigrants to England back in the fourth century, right. Then you would call that nativism, right? Nativism is, if you're not from here, you don't belong here. It's actually. I mean, it's something that you see everywhere in many other places in the world. The problem in the United States is that nobody's from here. We're all from somewhere. Right? You get what I'm saying? But nevertheless, this is going to be a big issue in the 1840s and 1850s is we don't want those damn foreigners coming over here. Right. Okay, so. And particularly not Catholics. All right? So at any rate, the point here is that this guy runs as on the ticket for the american party, and then the representatives for the south is going to be, or, excuse me, for the Democratic Party is going to be Buchanan. All right? Many people have said that they think Buchanan was probably the worst president, right. And the reason why he wins the presidency is going to be because the Republican, the rest of the electorate was essentially divided. Okay? And so he wins the presidency. But the one thing that we want to keep in mind is that the Republican Party. What was their, what was their platform again? Big business and free soil. Free soil. Which means what? You're right. Absolutely. Limit. Limit the expansion of slavery. Right. Limit the expansion of slavery. Okay, so the Republicans get no support. They're not even on the ballot in the south. Now, why is that? Because people in the south want to expand slavery. Exactly. All right. Okay. So we got to keep that in mind here.
