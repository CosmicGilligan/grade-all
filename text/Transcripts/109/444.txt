Winfield Scott establishes american administration over Mexico City, and then they start to negotiate a treaty. The problem is there's no government to negotiate with. And so eventually what ends up happening is that Mexicans are able to form a government, and they do start to negotiate with the. With the Americans. All right, in the meantime, in the United States, there's a group of people, many people, actually, who say, well, we've already got Mexico. Why don't we just keep it right? And this is what's known as the all Mexico idea. The all Mexico idea is the idea that since we've already taken it, we might as well keep it right. But there were a number of people who were in favor of that, but there were also a number of people who were against it. And it really kind of brings together two very different groups who are opposed to the idea of all Mexico. One of them is the liberals, like Abraham Lincoln, who say that american conquest of territory goes against the american ideal. American ideals don't include conquest. American ideals include liberty and equality and those sorts of things. And also, there's another group led by this guy, John Calhoun. You remember, we talked about him briefly last week when we said that he was the kind of face of southern white supremacy and states rights, and he thought that adding Mexicans to the United States would weaken american democracy because democracy was only for white people. He actually said this in the Congress, essentially, right, that only white people are able to practice democracy. And therefore, if we add all these non white people to the United States, that will weaken the United States. Okay, so we have two very different points of view, but both of them against. Against the annexation of Mexico. All right, guys, with any questions, comments about this? All right, so the. Polk had sent a diplomat, his name was Nicholas Tristram, to Mexico to negotiate the treaty. He had a falling out with Trist and eventually fired Trist. But in the meantime, Trist had actually gained the trust of the mexican government. So he went ahead and negotiated a treaty. The treaty was negotiated a little town outside of Mexico called Guadalupe Hidalgo. And they. They actually came to an agreement on this date, February 2, 1848. Right? And the agreement, Mark, made the border between the United States at the Rio Bravo. And then there, this was the border that was defined. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about this? So that's where we see the creation of most of our southern border. All right, there was one thing that comes about after this, and that is that, if you'll recall, the reason why Polk wanted to add California was why trade with Asia all right, so let's think about this for a minute. Once we get all the goods from Asia to San Francisco, or actually Sacramento, which is connected to San Francisco by river, right? Once we get all the goods from Asia to Sacramento, then what? Where is the population of the United States located? It's all back here in the east. So how are you going to get goods from California back east? What kind of a technology would allow that? Trains. Exactly. A railroad. Okay, so now there's a number of different proposals in Congress about building railroads, okay? To connect the west coast with the east. And one of them was to connect Chicago to Seattle. One of them was to connect Chicago to Sacramento. That's the Union Pacific. And one of them was to connect New Orleans to Los Angeles. Okay? And the problem with create with building a railroad from New Orleans to Los Angeles was that you couldn't build a railroad through this territory. It was occupied by hostile natives and too rugged, too mountainous. And so the United States determined that the best place to build this railroad would be through this territory. But this territory still actually belonged to Mexico. Okay? So what happened was, in 1853, Americans sent a man named Gadsden to Mexico to negotiate with Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, who's once again president for the last time, actually, the sale of this area. And Santa Ana vigorously said, no, we will not sell this territory. And Gadsden then put out the word in Mexico City, reminding them, well, do you remember what happened last time? You said that you wouldn't sell us territory. Right. Be shame if something happened, right? And so they sold the territory, and that's how we added that last little bit of the southern border. All right, so that's then the creation of the southern border and the war with Mexico. All right, questions? Comments?
