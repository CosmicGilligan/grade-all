What was the major outcome of the mexican american war? What did the United States win? Texas and California. Texas and California and all the. All the area in between. It was a really enormous area of land that the United States won. Now, just keep that in mind, and let me ask you this other question. If you're thinking about us politics in the 1840s, what is the big issue? Free states or slave states? Right. Slave versus free. Okay. So now these two ideas are going to come together after the mexican american war, because now the United States has a whole. An enormous amount of territory that they need to figure out how they're going to use it. And one of the things that happens when Congress addressed the issue was there was a man from Pennsylvania named David Wilmot, and he introduced a. We'll call it the Wilmot proviso. And what it really is is something that was tacked on to a bill that would incorporate the newly gained territories into the United States. But what the Wilmot proviso called for was the abolition, or the. Well, I guess we should say abolition. Not really, but that the new territory that was gained could not be slave territory. Okay. Now, why would that be a problem? Let's take a look at the map here. Right? You can't see the screen. I'm sorry. I do that more often than not. Okay, so let's take a look at the map here. And this is the territory. Texas, New Mexico, Utah, and California. Actually, Texas was really already part of the United States. Right. And so we added all of this new territory here. Right. But what would be a reason why people would think that this territory should be open to slavery? Where had the United States. Because it's below the. That line. The. Okay, yeah. The Missouri compromise line. So if you guys remember the Missouri compromise, the Missouri compromise was where the Ohio river meets the Mississippi river, and all the way west, slavery was forbidden north of that territory, but not south. But if you'll recall, United States didn't own any territory south of that. It was all part of the spanish empire. Right? So now it's now part of the United States, and it's south of the territory. Right. Why can't the United States. Why can't slavery exist in these new territories? Okay. And this becomes a huge question. This becomes a political issue that people can't. People can't. The Congress can't move forward with incorporating this territory because they can't. The Congress is broken, divided over the issue of slavery.
