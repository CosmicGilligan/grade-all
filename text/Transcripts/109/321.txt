Up until the time of the seven Years War, the french and indian war, the British, although they theoretically ruled America, they were distracted by politics at home and essentially had lost control of the empire. So that period leading up to the seven years war, from the time of William and Mary up until the time of the seven Years War, the french and indian war was called the era of benign neglect. You guys will remember that, right? The era of benign neglect was when England passed laws for America that Americans ignored, like navigation acts and things like that. And the Americans had developed a real sense of independence. But as a result of the seven years of the french and indian war, the British tried to reassert colonial control in America. Like we had discussed on Monday with the kid who was a latchkey kid, now the parents are trying to assert their rights, and the kids saying, well, I'm grown up now. I don't need a parent to do this kind of stuff. For me, that's kind of the atmosphere, the kind of paradigm, I guess you could say, for what's happened with this relationship between the colonies and Britain. Okay, so now we have really colonies in America, people in America who really have developed their own independence, and we have the mother country, Britain, trying to reestablish colonial control. So the colonists are going to be resistant to this movement by the British to reassert control. And so let's just take a look at some of the actual narrative. And remember, we started talking about the idea of the taxes, right? And the problem here was that the British had won the war, and it had been a great victory for Britain, but at the same time, it was very expensive. And the british people, the english people, were being taxed heavily to pay for this war. And parliament decided that it would be a good idea to tax the Americans because the war had actually gained a lot for the Americans. In theory, it gained all that land that had once been part of the french empire, now is all british. And plus the american colonies had been protected from the French and Indians. And so the parliament said, well, it would be fair for Americans to pay taxes to help pay for this. So Parliament created a tax that basically they put a tax on goods. Anything that was printed. So that would mean newspapers, just regular paper playing cards, books, anything that was printed, you had to pay a tax on it. And the way that they knew the tax was paid was that there would be a stamp on it, right? So they called it the Stamp act. And they said, okay, you colonists have to buy. You have to pay this tax if you want this manufactured material, the problem for the colonies is that because of the mercantile system, the colonies are essentially forbidden from manufacturing their own. The colonies essentially have to buy things from Britain, because that's the structure of the empire, that the colonies exist to provide resources and markets to the industry or to the commercial interest in Britain. So the idea would be that Americans send raw materials to Britain, and then Britain refines those materials and sells them back to the Americans. Right. So that means if you want anything, as a colonist, generally speaking, you have to buy it from Britain. And if you now have to pay a tax on it, then that's going to be a burden on you. Now, we could say, okay, well, taxes are a burden on everybody, but the taxes are paid for the benefit of everybody. But what was the big problem that Americans had with paying this tax? They didn't have any representation. Exactly. They had no representation in parliament, so they did pay taxes. They paid taxes to their local assemblies and to their local townships and things like that. But they didn't pay tax to parliament because they didn't have representation in. Almost like. It's almost like I said the other day, it would be like if the Parliament of Canada decided to tax all Americans on anything, right. If somebody told you you have to pay this tax to. Right. Would you do it? Would you do it willingly? No. Right. And that's the way Americans felt. Okay, so then what happens is there's this group of people who forms, and it's a really loose group. And I think if we think about today's politics, when we think about the Sons of Liberty, we could kind of, in a way, make a comparison to Antifa. I don't know how much you guys know about antifa, but Antifa isn't really an organization. There isn't any president of Antifa. There isn't any antifa headquarters or any of that stuff. It's just that whenever there's a provocation, then groups of people will come together calling themselves Antifa. And that's kind of the way Sons of Liberty were. Sons of Liberty was not an organization, but it was a group of people who would gather to protest what they considered to be wrongdoing by the government. Okay, so, for example, when you guys have read about when the british governor in Massachusetts tried to assert control over Massachusetts, then the sons of Liberty gathered together and burned down his house and stole his dishes and hung him in effigy. Really, when we think about the Sons of Liberty, we want to be able to think about them as patriots. But what we really see is if you were part of the established society, you would look at them as a bunch of terrorists, essentially. Right? Okay. So at any rate, what they did was they organized protests throughout the colonies. Right? So it was in Boston, but it was also throughout the colonies there was protest against this tax measure. And the result was that the parliament repealed the Stamp act. They said, ok, you don't have to pay this tax. Okay? But at the same time, they passed another law called the Declaratory act. And what the declaratory act said was, well, you don't have to pay that tax, but you have to pay tax to parliament. So the declaratory act essentially said that we have the right to tax you, we parliament have the right to tax the colonies, and we will. And so what we see then is that the fundamental problem wasn't really solved by repealing the Stamp act. And then we see that again just a few years later when they decide to enact some other tax, which they called the Townsend duties. Townsend was the name of the prime minister. Right. And the duties is a tax on imports. And pretty much everything that was imported from Britain, you had to pay a tax on it to parliament. And again, as I mentioned to you earlier, the Americans were reliant on imports. So these duties end up being burdensome to the Americans. All right? And the result was that they organized what was called a non importation movement. Okay. And what that meant was that Americans started to manufacture their own things and to make do. Right. The significance of this is that Americans, when they had to manufacture their own things, Americans were not developed to a point where they could actually manufacture things of the same quality as they could import. Okay? So this non importation movement, then, it plants the seeds for american industry, but it also represents a sacrifice on the part of the Americans. The Americans say, well, we would rather live quality goods than have to pay this burden tax. Right? What happens is that Americans say, okay, they unite and say, we're not going to pay the taxes on imports, we're just not going to import anything. Now, if you are in Britain, and who would you be in Britain who relied on exports to America? What part of the economy? Merchants. Merchants, exactly. Okay. So if the Americans aren't importing anything, what's that going to do to your business? Ruin it. It's going to hurt your business, isn't it? Okay, so now if your business is being hurt by the policies of parliament, how do you think that's going to affect parliament? Will the merchants be happy with parliament? Do you think they'll say, oh, yeah, I'm glad parliament is taxing the Americans, because that's ruining my business. You think they'll say that? What do you guys think? No. Right. And so what ends up happening is that they put a lot of pressure on the parliament. Parliament then repeals the Townsend duties. But the thing that we need to really understand here is that every time the parliament tries to assert its authority over America, even though they back down, Americans come to believe that there's a strategy, really, of oppression coming from the parliament. And keep in mind that many people in America don't even think that they should have to answer to parliament. They think that they should answer only to the king. And so, as we talked about on then, what we see then is this growing tension between Americans and the British, where both sides have become entrenched and they're not able to really gauge the acts of the other party. Okay. And one of the things that makes this worse, actually, is that there are a number of people in America who have decided that it's time to break away from England, that they shouldn't actually be subject to Britain anymore. And what they will do then is they will publish materials that will paint the actions of the British in the worst possible light. For example, Samuel Adams. Not the beer guy, but a different guy. Samuel Adams in Boston, published a paper that was incredibly critical of everything that the British did. Right to the point, almost in some cases, of what we would call fake news. Right. But it had an effect on the people of Boston because they became more and more unhappy. They would become more and more in favor of the idea of breaking away. Okay. All right. Now, in March of. One. One example of this is in March of 1770, there was an incident that happened where the sons of liberty who were. Again, if we were to look at this event and we saw the Sons of Liberty, we wouldn't think of it as. We probably wouldn't think of it as some kind of an organization. We would think of it as a mob. Okay. And their sons of liberty were actually harassing the soldiers who were guarding the customs house in Boston. All right. Well, the customs house is where they collect the taxes. And Americans at this point, see the taxes as their great oppressor. Right? And so they're actually harassing the british soldier who's guarding that, and they start throwing rocks at him. Okay? Now, some of the accounts say they were throwing snowballs. They really weren't throwing snowballs. There was snow, but they put rocks in the middle of them. Right? And so they're throwing rocks at the soldier, and he calls for help, and then some other soldiers come out of the barracks to. To defend him. And then right in the middle of this kind of crisis, I guess you could say that's happening, this heightened tension. Somebody yells fire. And it's really unclear actually who did. But what ends up happening is the british fire on the Americans, and a number of Americans are killed. Okay, well, now, that's bad enough, but there's a british law that says that the british military can't fire on british civilians without the express permission of the king, right? Which meant that when the soldiers fired on the british subjects, they were committing a felony, and the punishment for that felony is death. And so the soldiers were tried in Boston. And interestingly, the man who defended them was a lawyer named John Adams. Okay, John Adams at this point was just a lawyer. He wasn't really a revolutionary. He believed in the law, and he thought he knew that everybody needed a defense. And these guys were unpopular, right? So he defended these unpopular soldiers because been essentially roundly condemned by the local population. They'd already been convicted in public opinion, right? But he argued successfully that they couldn't be held liable, and they were acquitted. Okay, so the problem, of course, with that is that the way that the press will portray that is that the british soldiers violated the law. They committed a felony, and then they got off the hook, right? And it will show then that the British aren't even following their own laws in their oppression against us. You guys get that? Okay? So it creates more tension between the British and the Americans. Now, we'll move forward a little bit later. I think I mentioned this the other day when I was talking about taxation, and I talked about the problem with the British East India Company and how the British East India Company was in danger of going bankrupt. And so parliament decided to rescue them by giving them the monopoly on the tea trade. And so what that meant was that if you were going to buy tea in America, you had to buy, or anywhere in the empire, you had to buy it from the British East India Company. And as I mentioned to you, the parliament thought that this would be well received by the colonists because they knew that the colonists would be able to get the tea really cheap, right? So the idea then was that Americans will have to buy the British East India Company tea, but they'll get it really cheap, so they should be happy. Okay, well, they weren't happy. They were very unhappy. And so one of the kind of results of that is going to be, that's when Americans decide to stop drinking tea. And instead, they drink coffee. So that's why we have Starbucks coffee rather than Starbucks tea, I guess. Right. But there was what they call the tea Party. And what that meant was there was a group of people, interestingly, dressed up as Native Americans, who went onto the ships at night and threw the tea in the harbor and destroyed a lot of tea. Right. But now I got a little clip I want to show you here of not the tea party itself, but the atmosphere in Boston at the time. And it comes from a miniseries called John Adams, which was on HBO. I think you can find it pretty much everywhere. And it's a really interesting and pretty well done and historically accurate video. But I want to show you this one little scene concerning the issue of tea. All right, so let me go ahead and show that here. What is it Mr. Hancock requires of me? You'd like your advice? If he is in need of legal advice, I will speak to him. John Adams is Sam Adams. Exercise to win me over the business. John, the dock, the Eleanor, the beaver, just in their holes full of tea. All British Ships, the king demands their cargo be unloaded. Cargo which we, the citizens of Boston, must pay new taxes, subject to arrest. You will not laugh. This cargo, gentlemen, this is legitimate cargo. Tea from the East India Company that you are bound by law to unload. What's legitimate about it, friend? No other tea is allowed in Boston Harbour. Either we drink the king's foul brew or nothing at all. And who may you be, sir? John Hancock, ship owner. Not John Hancock, smuggler. What's your word, sir? I'm an honest man being strangled by monopoly. Shame on you, sir. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Teach him a lesson. Bastard. Barberism. Barberism. Animal. I of this. People are hurt when they fight for what is right. Approve of brutal and illegal act to enforce a political principle to have. Answer me that. Can you die? So there's your sons of liberty. What do you guys think? Can you hear me? It was insane. It was terrible. Well, that was. Did you guys know about that before? Anybody have known about that? That was actually based on a true event. And actually, the guy who was tard and feathered lived. He was mutilated, actually, but he lived. So how does that affect your thinking about what we call the sons of liberty, the american patriots? Because that mob, that was the sons of Liberty, right? What do you guys think about that? They acted like a bunch of barbarians. Yeah. So can you see how if you were the British, or if you were in established society and you saw these things going on around you. Even though the TTax may have been burdensome, it may have been an oppression, but was this a proper response to it? And interestingly, it wasn't that behavior that was condemned by the people at the time. We look at the tea party now. A lot of people say, oh, yeah, the Tea party. That was a heroic act. It was an act that really leads up to the american revolution, right? And so the people who did it were all patriots and that sort of thing. But the reality was that it wasn't the brutality that people were against. George Washington was against it. A lot of people were against it. It wasn't the brutality. It was the fact that they were destroying private property. They would draw the lines. The whole thing that they were fighting for was the protection, preservation of private property, right? So if you take somebody's property and throw it in the ocean, then that's a bridge too far for the Americans, right? You guys get what I'm saying? So that tells us a lot, I think, about the kind of environment that the american revolution came out of. And that environment was very different from the idealized, mythologized environment that we learn about when we're in elementary school, for example, of the heroic american patriots and the brutal and oppressive British. You guys get what I'm saying? So hopefully, now, I didn't do this because I think that there was something wrong with the American Revolution or any of that stuff. It's not my place to judge it. I just want us to be able to see past the mythology to the reality of what actually happened at that time. Okay, so what happens then is that the parliament will learn about the Tea Party. It was an enormous amount of money that was destroyed. And what will happen is the parliament will pass a series of acts called the Coercive Acts, which Americans call the intolerable acts, right. And this series of acts will essentially close the port of Boston until the money that was destroyed is repaid. Not only do they close the port of Boston, but then they also take away the right of the people in Massachusetts to govern themselves. They impose a royal governor. They essentially make the assembly illegal. Right? So that's going to be the response of the parliament. So there again, we can see this tendency where the British tried to assert royal control and the Americans resist it. And then the response to that is going to be even more control by the British rather than trying to work things out.
