Now we turn our attention to the structure of the federal government established by the constitution. This system divides the powers of government among three distinct the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Each branch plays a critical role in the governing process. The legislative branch, as its name suggests, is primarily responsible for crafting laws. It's the engine that generates the legal framework for our nation. The executive branch, on the other hand, take center stage in implementing those laws. It's the arm that carries out the will of the legislature and ensures the smooth functioning of government on a daily basis. The judicial branch occupies a unique position. Unlike the other two branches, its core function isn't explicitly defined in the Constitution. This ambiguity led to early debates concerning the power of the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary to interpret laws for the states. As we'll explore in future lectures, the concept of judicial review gradually emerged, solidifying the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutionality. In essence, the Supreme Court's pronouncements became the final word on what constitutes lawful and unlawful actions under the Constitution. So we have a system where the legislature proposes, the executive executes, and the judiciary interprets, with each branch serving as a check on the power of the others. This intricate system of checks and balances is a cornerstone of american democracy. The executive branch is presided over by the president, who holds the pivotal role of overseeing various departments, such as the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Commerce, among others. These departments collectively form the administrative apparatus through which the federal government operates. The president's primary responsibility, as mandated by the Constitution, is the enforcement of laws. The method by which the president is elected is distinctive utilizing a mechanism known as the electoral College. This system may have come to your attention during recent electoral disputes in states such as Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. These disputes were not predicated on the notion that the vote was narrowly contested in terms of the popular vote. Indeed, in the most recent election, there was a significant difference in the popular vote between the two principal candidates. However, the margin of victory within the electoral college was comparatively narrower. The electoral college is constituted based on a formula that includes the number of representatives a state has in the House of Representatives plus its two senators. This structure means that states like California have a significant number of electoral votes due to their large representation in the House, whereas states with minimal representation, such as Wyoming, have fewer electoral votes. In a presidential election, candidates present a slate of electors in each state who pledge to vote for them. The system in most states awards all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote within that state, a mechanism known as the winner takes all system. This can result in a scenario where a candidate who wins the popular vote nationally may not win the presidency if they do not secure a majority of the electoral votes. The requirement for a majority, as opposed to a plurality, is crucial. In the electoral college, a majority necessitates more than half of the electoral votes, while a plurality is merely the largest share of votes that does not need to surpass the halfway mark. This distinction underscores the potential for a candidate to ascend to the presidency without winning the majority of the popular vote, a situation that has occurred in several instances throughout american history. The experiences and philosophical inclinations of the founders led them to harbor concerns about concentrating too much power in any single entity, whether it be a central government or the populace at large. Their weariness of a strong central government stemmed from their adverse experiences with the british parliament, while their fear of populist rule was fueled by the unruly mob actions that precipitated the constitutional convention. This dual concern motivated the drafters to devise a system that would mitigate these risks by introducing a mediating layer between the election of the president and the will of the people. The electoral college was conceived as this buffer aimed at preventing the direct election of a president by the populace. The underlying fear was that without such a mediating mechanism, the public might be swayed by momentary passions or manipulated by demagogues, leading to the election of unqualified or unsuitable candidates. To illustrate, imagine a scenario in which, in a wave of national disillusionment with politics, the electorate decides and masks to vote for a purely symbolic or facetious candidate, such as a well known cartoon character. The electoral college in this construct serves as a safeguard that would theoretically prevent the installation of such a candidate into the presidency irrespective of the popular vote. This mechanism allows electors the discretion to override the popular choice if deemed necessary for the nation's well being. Historically, this aspect of the electoral college has come into play in various forms, as seen in attempts to influence or change electors votes in recent elections. Such maneuvers underscore the electoral college's role as a check on the direct power of the electorate over the executive branch, embodying the founders intent to balance democratic participation with a safeguard against potential excesses of direct democracy. It is important to note that while there have been electors who changed their votes, referred to as faithless electors in various elections, no national election has ever been decided by faithless electors. The primary rationale behind the electoral college's creation was to ensure a moderated and deliberative process for electing the president, reflecting a profound concern for both the stability of the republic and the prevention of tyranny. Whether originating from a monarch or a mob, the secondary rationale behind the establishment of the electoral college relates to the framers vision of the United States as a federation of states, each possessing a degree of autonomy and influence over national affairs. This perspective is rooted in the constitutional principle that the president should be elected through a process that reflects the states role in the federal structure rather than through a direct popular vote. An intriguing aspect of the US constitution is its provision allowing states considerable leeway in determining the method for selecting electors. Initially, this flexibility meant that in the first presidential election, electors were predominantly appointed by state legislatures rather than being chosen through a popular vote. This arrangement underscored the notion that the election of the president was a matter for the states to decide, reflecting their sovereign status within the union. It was only subsequently that states began to establish laws prescribing the election of electors by the people, a shift that gradually democratized the process. However, the constitution's original language maintains the states prerogative to decide how electors are chosen, a testament to the enduring importance of federalism in the american political system. The office of the president is defined by a four year term with the possibility of re election. Notably, the constitution originally imposed no limit on the number of terms a president could serve. This absence of a term limit led to the establishment of a two term tradition by George Washington, who voluntarily stepped down after his second term. This precedent of relinquishing power after two terms persisted until Franklin D. Roosevelts four elections to the presidency. In the 1930s and early 1940s, in response to Roosevelt's unprecedented tenure, the constitution was amended to restrict the presidency to two consecutive terms, reinforcing the principle of periodic leadership renewal. As a safeguard for democracy, the primary function of the legislature is to create laws. However, the structure of this branch is unique. The United States Congress is considered bicameral, meaning it consists of two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate. This bicameral structure emerged from a key debate during the constitutional convention. One faction argued for a unicameral legislature with equal representation for each state. This approach ensured that the voice of each state, regardless of size, would be heard. However, others countered that such a system would give undue power to less populous states, effectively diminishing the influence of larger states and their citizens. Imagine, for instance, that Delaware had the same number of representatives as Virginia. In this scenario, the people of Virginia would have considerably less influence on the government compared to their counterparts in Delaware. On the other hand, a legislature based solely on population would overwhelm the voices of citizens in smaller states. Delaware, with its significantly smaller population compared to Virginia, would find its voice drowned out. The solution crafted by the founding fathers was a bicameral legislature that incorporated elements of both proposals. The House of Representatives reflects population distribution. The number of representatives allotted to each state is directly tied to its population, ensuring a proportional voice for more populated states. To maintain this balance, a census is conducted every ten years to determine any necessary adjustments in representation. This explains the recent census and the potential for states like California to gain or lose representatives based on population shifts. The Senate, however, takes a different approach. Originally, senators were not elected by the people, but rather appointed by state legislatures or governors. This system ensured that the interests of the states themselves were directly represented within the federal government. In simpler terms, the Senate champions the interests of the states as a whole, while the House champions the interests of the people. The 17th amendment, ratified in 1913, changed how senators are chosen. Today, senators are directly elected by the people within their respective states and serve six year terms with the possibility of re election. Similarly, members of the House serve two year terms with the opportunity to be re elected by their constituents. There are no term limits for either senators or representatives. As long as they continue to win elections, they can serve in Congress indefinitely. This might explain the presence of some senators well into their eighties and nineties. The judiciary holds the responsibility of determining whether laws passed by the legislative branch and actions taken by the executive branch comply with the supreme law of the land, the Constitution. This power is central to the concept of checks and balances within the american political system. Federal judges, including those on the Supreme Court, are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Unlike elected officials in the other branches, federal judges enjoy lifetime tenure. They serve until they retire, pass away, or are removed from office through impeachment. The recent passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Antonin Scalia exemplify this. We had also seen instances of retirement, such as that of Justice John Paul Stevens, and resignation, like that of Justice Anthony Kennedy. While the judiciary may not garner the daily spectacle associated with the legislative or executive branches, its power is arguably the most consequential. Judicial pronouncements hold significant weight. There are only two ways a judicial decision can be overturned. The court itself can reverse its stance, though this is uncommon, or the Constitution can be amended. A complex and challenging process. In essence, the judiciary acts as the silent guardian of the constitution, ensuring that the other branches function within the boundaries established by this foundational document. Their rulings have the potential to shape the course of the nation, making the judiciary a vital pillar of american democracy. Consider, in the original design of the federal government, only a single branch, the House of Representatives, was directly elected by the people. Why this limited mandate? The founding fathers harbored a degree of distrust towards the general populace. Fearing the inherent volatility of an unrestrained majority, there was genuine concern that placing too much power in the hands of the people could lead to societal instability and undermine the fledgling government. This philosophy was heavily inspired by the writings of John Locke, particularly his emphasis on the protection of property rights. The prevailing belief among the founders was twofold. Firstly, only property owners had a true stake in the nation, as articulated in Locke's work, and secondly, that ownership fosters a sense of responsibility and aligns individual interests with the broader interests of the country. Conversely, those lacking property might prioritize their own well being over that of the nation. This deliberate structure, with limited direct input from the citizenry, was further reinforced by the complex system of checks and balances we see embedded in our constitution. Understand, this was no accident. Imagine introducing a new law. It must laboriously navigate committees, pass through both legislative chambers, reconcile potential discrepancies, earn presidential approval, and even then face legal challenges in the courts. Efficient, certainly not effective at preventing any single individual or faction from exercising undue power. Absolutely. The fear the founding fathers held was not limited to the potential excesses of the people, but also to the potential tyranny of a centralized government. Their own experience with british rule had shown that efficiency often came at the cost of individual liberty. Hitlers regime exemplified a chillingly effective government where commands were carried out with unquestioning obedience. The american system, while often frustratingly slow, was designed as a safeguard against such unchecked power. When we hear criticisms of gredlock in Washington, it's important to remember that this was exactly the outcome the founders envisioned. They embrace the idea that the government which governs least, governs best. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.
