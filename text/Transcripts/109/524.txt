All right. So now let's just talk briefly about the progress of the war and what I've done here. You can, again, this is all on canvas. You can go look at it. But I put together a chart here with what I consider to be probably the most important moments of the civil war, keeping in mind that I've put 123-456-7789 battles here, but they were somewhere around 10,000 battles in the civil war. Right. So I'm just going to talk about the big ones. All right. And so the first one happens in right outside of Washington at a place called Manassas, Virginia. And one of the places, one of the things you'll notice is that, is that the north and the south have different names for the battles. Right? So in the north they call this first battle bull run. First bull Run. And the south calls it the Battle of Manassas. Right. Okay. And it's just because it's different people, they have different names for the creek that's there. It's Manassas Creek or Bull Run, depending on how you look at it. Right. Well, the way that this battle was fought was, and again, keep in mind that everybody thought this was going to be, you know, glorious. And so this is right outside of Washington, DC. See if I can find a map here that will show us this. I can't read my map here. I'm not sure that we're going to be able to see. But. But Manassas is right outside of Washington, DC. Right. In fact, it's really close to, it's close enough that people can go out there on their carriages. Right. And so what happened was everybody in Washington, all the kind of elite people, thought, hey, there's going to be a big battle. It's going to be cool. Let's go watch, let's pack our picnic lunches, and we'll go sit and we'll watch the battle happen and we'll watch the union win the war. What happens then is the whole, a large number of people who come out to the battlefield to be witnesses, to be an act, to be the audience. Right. Like it's going to be a football game or something. Okay. And so keeping in mind that then there the confederate troops then meet with the, with the Union troops, the confederate general in charge really is Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard. And he sets up his headquarters in the kitchen of a local farmer. The outdoor kitchen. Right. And then the Union general is Erwin McDowell. Okay. And at the beginning of the battle, the Union starts to push the Confederacy back. One of the incidents that comes out of this is that there was one group of Confederates led by the commandant of the Virginia Military Institute named Thomas Jackson, who refused to fall back, and he's going to be an inspiration to other leaders on the confederate side. One of them will cry out, look, there stands Jackson like a stone wall. And so he becomes known as. Come on, you guys. Stonewall Jackson. Stonewall Jackson, exactly. All right, so that's where that comes from. And then what happens? This is actually the first battle in history where the. Where more troops are brought to the battlefield by train in the middle of the battle, right? And that's what happens. The Confederates are able to pull up to bring in more troops, and eventually what happens is they start to push the Union troops back. But now, by this time, the spectators have come to realize that this isn't as much fun as they thought it was going to be, watching people get killed. And so they all pack up their stuff and get in their carriages and go back to Washington. But when they do that, they block the road, which means that the Union army can't withdraw in an orderly fashion, and instead, they turn around and they run. Right. So this first battle makes it look like the Union is incredibly weak and the Confederacy is incredibly strong. You guys get what I'm saying here? It really sets the kind of tone for the next couple years of the war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about any of this? One thing I should mention before we go on. And that is to say that even though the Confederates were winning battles, the Union was always winning the war, because even though the Union might lose more men or lose battle, they could always replace them because they had the population to do it. But when the south lost men, they couldn't replace them. Right? So as long as the war kept going on, the south was closer to losing because they couldn't replace their losses. Okay, just keep that in mind. All right? Okay, so now we move on to the next battle. The guy who was put in charge of the. Of the army after McDowell was a man named George McClellan. George McClellan called himself the Napoleon of the west. So that kind of shows you his sense of self, right. But it also shows us that he's very much interested in politics. Remember that Napoleon became the emperor of France, okay? So he's going to be a very cautious general, and what's going to happen is that Lincoln will order McClellan to take Richmond, and the way that he's supposed to do that is he's supposed to take his army down the Chesapeake Bay land on the Yorktown peninsula. This is the same place where the Americans won the revolutionary war and then march to take Richmond. Okay, and what happens is that McClellan organizes the army and moves it here to Virginia. But he doesn't. He doesn't actually move against Richmond. He does, but what's going to happen is that there's going to be a new leader of the confederate troops. His name is, as I mentioned, Robert E. Lee. And Robert E. Lee has dug a series of trenches around Richmond and Petersburg. We think of trench warfare. What do we usually think about? What war? World War one. Exactly. But they got the idea from Lee. All right? So at any rate, McClellan doesn't know how many troops Lee has, although he. The reality is he has many more troops than Lee. Okay? So he will keep telling, you'll kind of camp out here and he'll keep telling Lincoln, I need more troops. I need more troops, because he doesn't know how many troops Lee has. And eventually Lincoln will realize that McClellan has no intention of taking Richmond and he'll withdraw McClellan from Virginia back to Washington. Right? So that's called the peninsular campaign, and it's going to be seen as another defeat for. For the Union. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Okay, so now the result of that is that Lincoln is going to say, I don't like this guy McClellan because he's not winning battles. He's too timid. Right? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, now let's move to the west. In the west, there's going to be a battle at a place called Shiloh. The thing that the guy who was leading the Union army at Shiloh was Ulysses Grant. Okay? Ulysses Grant had been in the army during the mexican war. He stayed in the army after the Mexican War and was stationed in California. But he was a drunk and he eventually drank his way out of the army and he moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Had a grocery store there. And then when the Civil War started, he signed up as a mustering officer. Okay? But through a series of battlefield promotions, he ends up in command of the army, Shiloh, in early 1862. Okay? And he's going to win the battle of Shiloh. And one of the things that will characterize him is that he will only accept unconditional surrender. So Lincoln will notice that. And Lincoln will start to really follow the career of Ulysses Grant while he's losing faith in his generals from. In Washington. Right? And so we'll just leave it at that for now and again, keep in mind this happened in the west, so it wasn't something that people in the east knew a lot about or felt close to. Okay, questions, comments about this. All right, next. Later that same year, Lee has a plan, and he's. Oops, I keep doing that. I'm sorry. The. Lee's plan is to invade the north. His idea is that if you march across. If you march across Maryland and you march into Pennsylvania and you get to Harrisburg, this thing here. Harrisburg. Right. That's where the railhead is. That connects the west to the east. And if you could cut the railhead in Harrisburg, that would cripple the Union army because they would not be able to get supplies from the west. Okay. And so his plan then is to cross over what's known as Antietam Creek at a place called Sharpsburg, which is. Sorry, I got this thing in the middle of my screen here. Sharpsburg is right there. Okay. His plan is to cross into across Antietam Creek at Sharpsburg and then march across Maryland and into Pennsylvania. What happens is that in those days when you were giving orders to your subordinate officers, obviously you couldn't use any kind of secure communications or emails or radio or anything like that, so you had to write down your orders, and somebody would actually physically carry them to where they were supposed to go to. Right. And so he wrote down his orders for his generals at his plan to cross at Sharpsburg, or as the union will call the Antietam Creek. Right. And the person, the messenger who was carrying the orders, dropped them on the road, and a union sympathizer picked them up. And so by the time he got. By the time Lee tried to cross the creek, to cross the river at Antietam Creek, McClellan already knew what his plan was, and he was able to defeat him. Right? So Antietam becomes the very first major victory of the Union army. Okay? And then after the battle of Antietam, Lincoln says to McClellan, go get Lee. Lee had to withdraw back into Virginia. And Lincoln says, go get him. And McClellan refused. He said, I can't go because my army's been too defeated. Right. And so then McClellan is fired. Okay. And they replace him with a man named Ambrose Burnside. Oh, yeah. Okay. They replace him with a man named Ambrose Burnside. This, let me show you here. This is Burnside. And the thing that we can that kind of cements this place in history is his facial hair, which became known as sideburns because of who he was. Right? Okay? So sideburns come from Burnside. Okay, I keep going the wrong direction here. Alright? So at any rate, Burnside will be in control of the army at a major battle at a place called Fredericksburg in Virginia, where his army is going to be slaughtered. He basically orders them against an impregnable confederate position in the middle of winter. And so he loses many men and he's fired. He's replaced with a guy named Joseph Hooker. All right? Now what we can remember about Joseph Hooker was that one of the ways that Hooker was able to keep his army intact, because in those days, men would just leave the army. They would just get up in the middle of the night and go because they. Because they were homesick or whatever, right? And so what Joseph Hooker did was he brought in ladies of the night, okay? And these ladies became known as Hooker's girls, okay? And so that's where we get to name Hooker. So I'm not sure that's what I'd like to be remembered for, but that's where our term for prostitutes come from, is from Hooker, Joseph Hooker. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Well, Hooker was in control of the army at another battle at Chancellorsville. This is probably, I think, the high water of the, of the confederate power because the Confederates are going to actually win this battle. But one of the things that happens during the battle is that Jackson, Stonewall Jackson, who is Lee's right hand man, is going to be killed. And what that does is it really weakens the Confederate a team. We talked about the a team before, right? So, so now the. The Confederate a team is weakened, even though the. The. He's still facing the b team in the east. All right? So. So then Hooker is fired. And then they put another general in charge, George Gordon Meade. And this is in the summer of 1863. Lee decides to try his invasion of the north again. Right? Now, one of the things I want you guys to notice here is that the confederate troops didn't have shoes, right? They marched on in bare feet, if you can believe it, okay? Because the confederacy was poor. Okay? So. So when Lee crossed into Pennsylvania. Oops, I've got the wrong one here. When Lee crossed into Pennsylvania, he knew that there was a shoe factory, a little town called Gettysburg. So he took his army to Gettysburg to get shoes for his army. And because of some, I guess you could say, intelligence mix ups, he ends up being trapped at Gettysburg by the Union army. Okay? And what follows then, is going to be a three day battle. You guys have probably all heard of the battle of Gettysburg, right? And the outcome of the battle going to be that Lee's army is destroyed. Lee can no longer fight an offensive war, and he's forced to withdraw back into Virginia. And from that point on, Lee will be fighting a defensive war against the Union troops. All right, you guys with me? Questions, comments about this. Now, at the same time, there's going to be another victory in the west. I don't. This. Maybe you can see it here. The thing that had happened in the west was that Louisiana had been restored to the Union very early in the war, but the United States couldn't control the Mississippi because there was a. There was a confederate fortification at a place called Vicksburg in Mississippi. And so in order to be able to open up the Mississippi River, Grant, General Grant, came up with a plan to take Vicksburg. The problem with taking Vicksburg was that there was an enormous confederate army to the east of Vicksburg. And most people thought that the only way to get to Vicksburg was to come in from the east, right somewhere over here. But what Grant does is he decides to cross the river and march without supplies through Arkansas and Louisiana and then recross the river south of Vicksburg and attack it from the east between the confederate army and Vicksburg. And that's going to be a winning strategy. So on the same day that the United States wins or that the Union wins the battle of Gettysburg, they also win the battle of Vicksburg. Okay. And the outcome of this is going to be that Lincoln will decide that he should put Grant in charge of all the armies. Okay? So Lincoln decides to make Grant the first general of all of the Union armies because he has a record of winning. He's not afraid. Right? Now, keep in mind that I told you before that Grant had been cashier from the army because he was a drunk. Okay? And there is some. Some evidence that he was a drunk even during the civil war, although he was. He was able to stay sober for most of it, right? But the. The. One of the. Probably the premier historian about the civil war conjectures that the reason why Grant was so successful was because he was a drunk. Because he was known as a drunk. He had a reputation as a drunk. And because of that, he knew that he was never going to have a political career. Nobody would ever want him to be in politics, because everybody knew he was a drunk. You guys get what I'm saying? So. So when Lincoln decides to make grant the general of all the armies, the other generals in the. In the east, the political generals, are going to say, well, you know, he drinks. Right? And. And Lincoln is going to say, well, find out what he's drinking and give a case to all my other generals. Right? And so anyway, that's just kind of an interesting story. Now, here's the difference between Grant and the rest of the political generals, let's say. Okay? And the difference is that where the other generals would attack, lose, and then retreat, Grant would attack, lose, but keep advancing. Right. The reason why is he knew that even though he was losing battles, he was going to win the war because he could replace his losses, and the south could not replace their losses. You guys are following me here. All right, so there's this, what they call the Petersburg campaign, where Grant attacks, loses a battle, then attacks again, then loses a battle, then attacks again and loses a battle and attacks again and loses battle. But what ends up happening is that he places a siege around Petersburg, and his siege goes from 1864 into the spring of 1865 with the trenches to. Remember, I told you about the trenches. Okay? And as the siege goes on, Grant keeps adding more and more and more troops, and Lee keeps losing more and more and more troops because they're deserting or they're getting killed and they can't be replaced. And so by the end of the siege, there's only one confederate soldier every 50ft along the trench lines, and most of them are either 13 year old boys or 60 year old men. Right. You guys are with me. And so what's going to. What's going to happen is that Lee will eventually realize that he's not going to be able to win militarily. And so he will decide to retreat. And his plan is to retreat and to actually to wage a guerrilla warfare. Right. The idea being that they can't win a conventional war because the Union army is now too big, too powerful, so they're going to fight a guerrilla warfare. So what happens is that Lee flees, essentially, from Petersburg. The Union takes Richmond and Petersburg. And eventually what ends up happening is that Lee is surrounded at a little town called Appomattox courthouse. Okay? And then it's going. He's going to realize, I mean, on the last, really, the last day, he orders his cavalry to attack the Union army. And when they go over the hill to attack, they see a sea of blue uniforms, essentially. Right? There's Lee has about 25,000 men, and the Union army is about 100,000 men. Okay. And they're going to realize they can't win. So Lee will be convinced that he needs to surrender. Right. He receives a he receives a letter from Grant, and he responds to letters saying, well, I'll meet. I'll meet with you at this place called Appomattox Courthouse. Right. And when they. What happens is that he. He sends somebody into Appomattox courthouse to find a place for them to meet, and he runs into a guy. The guy who sent. Runs into a guy walking down the street. His name is Wilmer McLean. Okay. Or McLean. I'm not sure how to pronounce it, but if you guys will remember the very first. What was the very first battle that we talked about? Bull run. Was it the Boston tea party? No, I mean the one about the civil war. Right. Was the very first battle of the Civil War was that we talked about Bull Run. Bull run. Okay. And remember where you do remember who the confederate general was there? Pierre Gustave, toutant Beauregard. And where did he have his headquarters? Remember I told you that he had his headquarters in something of a local farmer. The outdoor. The kitchen. The kitchen, exactly. All right, so Beauregard's headquarters was in the outdoor kitchen. The guy who owned the farm was named Wilmer McLean. And Wilmer McLean decides, after the battle of Bull run, he doesn't want to be in a war zone, so he picks up everything and moves to a little town called Appomattox Courthouse. And then on this morning in April of 1865, he meets somebody from Lee's army, who convinces him, reluctantly, to allow the meeting between Grant and Lee in his parlor. Right. And so Grant and Lee then meet in the parlor. Wilmer McLean. I think I have a. Yeah, this painting here, this is the meeting between Grant and Lee, and Lee surrenders the confederate army. And that's going to be essentially the end of the war. It's going to keep going on a little bit longer, but. But that's essentially the end, because Lee, essentially, by this time, is the Confederacy. Right. And so from then on, Wilmer McLean could say that the civil war started in his kitchen and ended in his parlor. And that's a true story, folks.
