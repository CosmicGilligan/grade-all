One last thing we're going to talk about, and it has to do with Spanish America. And this is going to be important for us in a couple of different ways. One, by essentially cementing american foreign policy for the 19th century, but the other part of it is also going to set us up for the acquisition of all the western territories, right? So let me just start off by saying, let me see. Here's a map of Spanish America, right? And this is the map here. You see, this map shows the green part here, which was the spanish empire in America. And it's got dates in each of the different countries. And I know it's hard for you to see these dates, but, like Mexico's, 1821, Central America, 1822. Venezuela, 1814. You guys are all following me here, right? So these are the dates that these countries become independent from the spanish empire. All right? Now, the reason why. Well, let's just say the reason why they became independent was because Spain was conquered by Napoleon during the. During the napoleonic wars in Europe, same as the war of 1812 in the United States, right? But what happens is that there are basically two different groups in Spanish America who think about what's going. What kind of countries are these new countries going to be? Right. And the two groups we're just going to right now call them liberals and conservatives, okay? And the liberals are people who believe that these spanish american countries should be ruled like the United States. So they look at the United States as a model for establishing popular government. Okay? The other group is going to be the conservatives. The conservatives are the ones who actually benefited from the spanish empire. And the result of it will be that they will. So what I'm looking for, that they. They will try to keep the structure of the spanish empire in place. Okay, I want you guys to just keep that in mind, okay, as we go through this course, right? But the main thing, the difference would be the difference, essentially, between a republic like the United states, or a monarchy, like Spain. All right, you guys follow me here. And the liberals would want a republic, and the conservatives would want a monarchy. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, well, now, all of the different countries or former colonies in Spanish America had achieved independence by 1824, right? And what that means from the point of view of the Americans is that, well, let me just say it this way before I get there. And that is to say that there was a lot of political turmoil and unrest in Spanish America, and it was this contest between the liberals and the conservatives. And the Americans obviously preferred the liberals for a couple of reasons. One being because it validated the american revolution. It validated the principles of the american revolution. But the other reason had to do with trade, because liberals believed in free trade. And so what happened then? If a liberal country, if a liberal government ruled in a spanish american country that was a trading partner for the United States, you guys get what I'm saying? So american interest in Spanish America is going to be twofold. On the one hand, it's ideological, because Americans believe in the kind of spread of the american revolution toward liberalism. Liberalism. Remember, we called it democracy, secularism, capitalism. So on the one hand, it's idealistic, and on the other hand, it's economic, because if these countries are liberal countries, then they're also free traders. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? So american foreign policy, then, is going to be driven by, just like american domestic policy is going to be driven by two different motivators, idealism and economics. All right, questions? Comments? About any of that? Okay, now what happens? Just, I want to, in fact, let me skip this. I'll do that later. Okay. So what happens is that as the spanish empire recedes, as these different colonies break away from the spanish empire, they fall into political instability and turmoil. And what that does is it makes them weak and it makes them kind of targets of other colonizing countries like Britain and France. Right? The idea then, is that the weakness of these spanish american countries, the political instability in these spanish american countries, makes them targets essentially of colonialism. And the Americans are concerned about the establishment of new colonies in the Americas because they see this, again, as, first of all, the opportunity to expand America's liberal influence, but also to expand America's economic influence. And so if the colonizing powers of Europe introduced new colonies, like, for example, the French tried to, to recolonize Mexico, right? And the British tried to recolonize other places. Right? If that happens, then that is going to be detrimental to american policy. You guys follow what I'm saying here? And so the Americans then are going to come up with a doctrine. We're going to call it the Monroe doctrine, right? And the, what the Monroe doctrine essentially says is this, the United States will view the establishment of any new colonies in the Americas as, quote, the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. And then, so basically what they're saying is, what do you think they're saying? What is the United States telling Europe? We don't want your interference. Right. Or what? Or else. Or nothing, really. Because the American, we have to remember that the United States was incredibly weak at this time. Right? And so when they, when they make this statement, they're, they're basically, it's like a three year old in the sandbox shaking their fist at the adults and saying, this is my sandbox. Stay out. Right. And what are the American. What are the adults going to do in response to that? What do you guys think? I'm sorry? Spank them. Well, do you think they're going to take them seriously? No. No. Do you think that the Europeans take this very seriously? No. No, they don't. Okay. But. And that's because the United States was weak at the time. But the United States is going to become more powerful. Right. At the end of the civil war, the United States had the largest land army on earth. And at the end of the civil war, or actually during the civil war, France tried to reestablish a colony over Mexico through what they call an empire, the empire of Maximilian. Right. And at the end of the civil war, the. The american army was placed on the Rio Grande, and an american ambassador went to France and asked, when are you leaving? When are you leaving Mexico? And they left Mexico right after that. Right? So the Americans, when they have the power to enforce their doctrine, will enforce it. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this? All right. Okay. So that's the Monroe doctrine. You're not going to hear more about that in this course, but you will hear about it in us history, too. Okay. All right. So then let me just go a little bit further and talk about in 1823, the United States was weak, and it didn't, it didn't really have the power to enforce its doctrine. But by 1894. I know it's a little bit out of our era, but there was an example of how american foreign policy became more aggressive over time, and that was what's known as the Venezuela boundary dispute. Okay? And what happens here is that there was. Venezuela was an independent country, had been for a long time, but Guyana was actually a british colony, okay? British Guiana, okay? And the. The border between Venezuela and British Guiana was pretty much undefined. And the reason why was because there was really nothing of any value in this area, so they thought. But what ended up happening was that somebody discovered gold. And then all of a sudden, Venezuela said, oh, that's our. That's our territory. And the British said, no, no, it's our territory. And the British threatened to go to war against Venezuela over this territory. Right. You guys are with me. So what Venezuela does is it appeals to the United States government to enforce the Monroe doctrine against the British. And what will happen is that the secretary of state, Richard Olney, is going to incorporate what's known as the Olney corollary to the Monroe doctrine. And what that says is the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition. Okay, so what do you think it means to be practically sovereign, like their own leadership, like no one else can lead in that area. Exactly. In practice, we are sovereign, even though we don't directly rule Venezuela, but we're practically sovereign. Right. Meaning we're in practice, we're sovereign over this entire area. And it says it's fiat is law. What is a fiat little italian car. Right, but that's not what they're talking about here. Have you guys ever heard the motto, the University of California? Fiat lux. Fiat lux. Which means let there be light. Right? It's from the bible, right? God said, let there be light. Fiat lux. But what that means then, is that a fiat is what I say it, and it happens. It's a godlike power, right? So what we see here is United States claiming godlike power over the Americas, right? In 1894. And how do you think the British respond? The British back down. Now, the British didn't back down because they were afraid of the Americans. They backed down because they had interests elsewhere, and he didn't want to get into a war with the United States in the Americas. So they essentially tacitly acknowledged American are us influence over the Americas. So the Americas become the United States sphere of influence. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? And that's going to remain really, even to some extent, up to today. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right, last thing, then I want to just briefly talk about this. This is going all the way back to even before the. The mexican revolution, right. Or between. Before Mexico became independent. And that was when the United States acquired Louisiana. The eastern boundary was well documented, but the western boundary was kind of wide open. Right. Because they just knew it's out there somewhere. Okay. And then as Americans moved further and further into the western, the Spanish became more and more concerned that Americans might take this territory from them. And so what they did was they negotiated a treaty with the United States to establish the boundary between the United States and the spanish empire. All right? Or the boundary between the United States and Mexico, because Mexico will later acknowledge this treaty, right? And so what happens is that the treaty is called the treaty of Adams Onis, because Adams was the american secretary of state and Onis was the spanish foreign minister. Right? And they established the American. The line between the United States and. And Mexico, where we see this big red line here, right? So it's actually the Sabine river, the Red river, and then some other geographical locations. And the end of it then is that it really gives us a defined boundary between the United States and the spanish empire. You guys roll with me. Questions, comments about this. The other part that comes into the Treaty of Adams Onis is that Florida had been ruled by the spanish empire, but they were incapable of controlling the native population there. And so the United States had been sending troops into Florida to defeat the natives. And so one of the outcomes of this treaty was that Florida was granted to the United States. United States got Florida and they defined this boundary. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Now the last thing that I want to mention about this is that when the United States went into the negotiations over the Adams Onis treaty, they claimed that the border of the United States with, or actually the border of the Louisiana purchase was on the Rio Bravo, or we call it the Rio Grande. Right? So the Americans claimed that this territory, everything north of this territory was american, right? But when they did that, actually nobody believed that that was where the Louisiana purchase. Where the boundary of the Louisiana purchase was. Okay? It was an opening bid. It's kind of like if you want to sell your motorcycle, you'll advertise it for 10,000 and take 7000, right? And that's what the Americans did. They had advertised for 10,000, but they settled for 7000. You guys follow I'm saying here? And so this territory ends up being essentially ceded by the United States, even though the United States really never believed that they owned it. You follow what I'm saying here? Okay. So then the one thing that we want to keep in mind is that in this treaty negotiation, the United States had at one point claimed the border of Texas to be the real. Bravo. Okay. And we want to keep that in mind for another lecture that we're going to have coming up relatively soon. Okay? Questions, comments about this?
