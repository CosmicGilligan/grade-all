In this segment, we're going to look at the settlement of New England by Puritans and draw a sharp contrast to the class based and agrarian society of the Tidewater region. Events in the early 17th century in Europe and America would have far reaching consequences for the yet to be imagined United States. The Puritans were a group of people who emerged during a turbulent time in english history deeply influenced by the religious reform sweeping across Europe. We discussed in a previous lecture how Henry VI initiated the English Reformation, that his changes were more about asserting his control than overhauling religious doctrine. This was quite different from the Reformation on the european continent, which was characterized by significant doctrinal shifts and the emergence of new Reformed churches distinct from the Catholic Church. These reforms challenged the catholic view that salvation was mediated through the church and its sacraments. Instead, Protestantism, particularly in its Lutheran and Calvinist forms, emphasized direct access to salvation through faith in God, a faith strengthened by personal engagement with the Bible. In this image, we see a puritan on the left, an Anglican in the middle, and a Catholic on the right. According to Puritan belief, Calvinism, more radical than Lutheranism, found fertile ground in England even as it remained officially outlawed. Following Henry VI's break from Catholicism, there was hope among some english and scottish believers that the anglican church could be purified from within to reflect Calvinist principles. This group, seeking to implement Calvinist reforms within the anglican church, came to be known as the Puritans. However, as the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I made clear, the Puritans faced significant obstacles in their efforts to reform the church from within. Frustrated and seeking a place to freely practice their faith, many Puritans relocated to the more religiously tolerant Netherlands. Yet longing for a permanent home where they could establish a pure christian society, they secured a charter from the english crown to establish a colony in America. The expedition that followed was motivated by more than just the desire for religious freedom. The Puritans aimed to create a new society that would serve as a beacon of christian virtue and piety, what John Winthrop famously envisioned as a city upon a hill. This concept, drawn from the Bible, symbolized their aspiration to build a community marked by harmony, righteousness, and a close relationship with God. In essence, the Puritans'journey to America was not just a quest for religious freedom, but an ambitious endeavor to establish a model christian society reflective of their deep convictions and rigorous faith. When individuals ventured to New England, their underlying motivations starkly contrasted with those of the settlers who first made their homes in Virginia. The distinction lies primarily in the nature of these motivations, the initial settlers of Virginia were driven by economic aspirations. Their aim was clear, to amass wealth. Envisioning themselves as a group of english gentlemen poised to subdue a grand indian empire, they sought to extract wealth in a manner reminiscent of the spanish conquests in New Spain. This venture, fueled by dreams of riches, encountered a fundamental flaw. The anticipated grand indian empire did not exist, yet the pursuit remained fundamentally economic. In contrast, the colonization of New England was propelled by a markedly different vision. The settlers aimed to establish a city on a hill, a concept that envisaged a model christian society. This vision was deeply intertwined with the missionary zeal of these settlers. Inspired by New Testament teachings, they sought to create a society that exemplified the city of God on earth. Their ambition was to found a community so prosperous and divinely blessed that it would serve as a beacon, inspiring others worldwide to emulate their christian way of life. This aspiration was predicated on the belief that such a society, in living in harmony with divine laws, would attract global admiration and voluntary adoption of their christian ethos. This idea mirrors a biblical precedent, the jewish quest to establish a holy city in what is now Israel, governed by a society that flourished under God's laws, thereby attracting global allegiance to God. However, historical attempts at realizing this vision were thwarted by corruption within the church. The Puritans, in the wake of the reformation, perceived a parallel between their mission and the biblical narrative. They viewed the era's prevalent church corruption as a recurrence of past failings. Determined not to repeat history, the Puritans embarked on a mission to accomplish what they believed the early church could not. They positioned themselves as the new Israel tasked with establishing a new, pure christian society in New England. This ambition was not merely about founding another community. It was a profound statement of faith and a declaration of their intent to renew Christianity itself. The Reformation thus played a crucial role in shaping the Puritan's mission. It was a response to what they saw as the degradation of christian values and practices, a chance to rectify these missteps on new soil. The Reformation instilled in them a sense of divine purpose, reinforcing their belief in the possibility of creating a society that truly reflected christian ideals. The Puritans'journey to New England was therefore much more than a geographical relocation. It was a quest for spiritual and moral renewal inspired by the transformative spirit of the Reformation. When the Puritans set sail for America, their charter called for them to settle near the tidewater region. However, they veered off course and instead landed in what would later become known as New England, specifically at a place named Plymouth. In 1620, they saw their journey as a pilgrimage. A pilgrimage refers to a journey to a sacred place undertaken for religious reasons. For instance, Muslims are required to undertake a pilgrimage known as the Hajj to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. In a similar vein, the individuals who voyaged to America aboard the Mayflower were termed pilgrims. This is because their journey was also imbued with a religious purpose, aiming to establish a new life where they could practice their faith freely. Ten years following the pilgrims'arrival in Plymouth, another group of settlers arrived and founded what is now known as Boston. This second wave of settlers came aboard the arbella part of the Massachusetts Bay colony under the leadership of John Winthrop. It was Winthrop who famously articulated the vision for this new society with the metaphor of a city upon a hill. He said, for you must consider that we shall be a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us, so that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword through the world. This vision encapsulated the idea that the settlers were not just creating a new home for themselves, but were also undertaking a mission to build a model society. Winthrop's words reflect the deep sense of responsibility and purpose that guided the settlers, highlighting their belief that their actions and the society they built would be scrutinized by the rest of the world. This mission to create a shining example of a community founded on religious principles and ethical living, was a driving force behind the establishment of settlements in New England. It would later be reformulated with a vision more informed by the principles of the Enlightenment. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.
