Okay, well, we're going to move out of the earlier part of the nation's history, what they call the early republic. And we're moving now into kind of an expansionist era between essentially between the end of the end of the war of 1812 and the civil war. And we're going to start off by talking about, how about a major change in american democracy, because as you guys will recall, when the country was first founded, most people were left out. The people who actually could vote were only property owning males. And we talked about why that was, because the idea, in theory, was that only property owning males first had anything to protect, and secondly, they were the only ones who would be able to rule wisely in favor of the country. What we're going to see is that as the nation grows geographically, it's also going to become more democratic. And let me just show you how that happens. All right, so are any questions before I get started? You guys are with me. Okay, so now, in 1787, which you guys will know is before the constitution. Are you guys seeing the screen? Yeah. You want to share? Screen on here. Sorry about that, guys. Now can you see it? Yes. Okay. All right. So in 1787, which was before the constitution, the Congress passed a law called the Northwest ordinance that was actually written by Thomas Jefferson. And what the Northwest ordinance did was it established a means for adding new territory to the United States. All right? And they called it the Northwest Territory because this was the northwestern part of the United States at that time. And what the ordinance said was that in order to add new states and keep in mind that states are not provinces, states are actually countries. This is the way people think about them at the time. Right? So in order to add new countries to this union of countries, the United States, the way that that would happen would be that the Congress would create a territory, and then people would move into the territory. And then once people were in, once there were enough people in the territory, they would hold a convention, elect a government, and apply for admission to the union. We already talked about this, I think, Monday, about how they had to apply as either slave or free. Interestingly, about the Northwest ordinance, which was written by Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, was that slavery was prohibited in the Northwest Territory. But at any rate, the point here is that the state would apply for admission, and then the Congress would say, yes or no, you're in or you're not in, which is going to be really important for us when we start next week on the discussion that we're going to have on Monday. But at any rate, the point here is that once the Congress had said yes, then the state is in. Okay? So there's going to be a couple of reasons why people would. People who moved into the. Into the new territory would be interested in encouraging other people to come. And one would be because of the idea of land speculation, as we've said, that the major kind of industry in the west at this time is selling land. And so you have to have somebody to sell land to in order to be able to sell it. So there would be a, you know, sentiment of wanting to get more people to come into the territory. And then also it had political ramifications as well, because if you were one of the first people in these new territories, then you would be more likely to be elected, you know, governor and representative and senator and things like that. So these new territories that were created did things to try to encourage people to move their. From the east, okay? And keep in mind that most of the population of the United States is in this area now, okay? And so the result of that was that one of the ways that they did that was by lowering the qualifications to vote from being a property owner to some other. Other. Either you had. Had contributed to the community somehow by, you know, serving the militia or something like that, or even in some cases, just by being a white male, you would be extended the vote. Right. And the reason for that is because Americans liked the idea of voting. And so the idea was that they would come to. People would say, well, if I moved, I'm in Massachusetts now, and I can't vote in Massachusetts, but if I move to Ohio, I'll be able to vote, and that's a big deal to me. Right. And so Americans are actually encouraged to move into these areas, and eventually they all become states by the. By the process defined in the northwest ordinance. The significance, though, is that as people are encouraged to move further west, the states in the east are going to become more alarmed, because if they're losing population, what else are they losing in terms of government? Votes in power? Representation in the house. Exactly. They're losing representation. And so they're going to then follow suit in lowering the qualifications for voting until by the 1820s, we have in the United States something called universal manhood suffrage. Okay? Now, keep in mind that the word here is not suffering. Right? Everybody's suffering. Everybody can suffer, but not everybody can vote. So suffrage is voting, okay? And just also keep in mind that the word franchise also means the right to vote. Okay? Keep that in mind. You guys are all with me. Questions? Comments? So by the 1820s. The United States is much more democratic than it was in the beginning, and at the same time, there are literally hundreds of thousands of new voters.
