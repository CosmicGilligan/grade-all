In this segment, we will consider an incident in colonial american history known as Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 within the colony of Virginia. This insurrection occurred pitting poor colonists against the landholding elite. Recall that we mentioned the development of a rigid, class based society in colonial Virginia. Nathaniel Bacon was a colonist in one of the lower echelons of Virginia society, but not the lowest. Bacon harbored ambitions to acquire land which brought him into conflict with the colonial government run by the upper level elite landowners. Governor William Berkeley had previously negotiated a pact with indigenous tribes, agreeing that settlers would refrain from encroaching upon native american lands in exchange for peace. Bacon perceived this agreement as antithetical to the interests of Virginia colonists who were eager to expand their territory. He believed the government was acting to protect its own interests and against the best interests of the colonists. Bacon mobilized both poor blacks and poor whites to challenge the authority of Governor Berkeley and the colonial elite. This coalition was significant as it demonstrated an early instance of cross racial collaboration in this early period. In colonial history, blacks and whites recognized their differences and were not integrated, but there was no latent sense of superiority or inferiority, and they could work together to pursue their common interests. We will see later in this course how this eventually became impossible. The rebellion itself was ultimately quashed by the colonial authorities. Following the death of bacon from disease, many participants were executed. In the aftermath, the House of Burgess, the Legislative assembly in Jamestown, enacted a series of restrictive laws targeting African Americans. These statutes, later known as the black codes, effectively decreed that individuals of african descent could not enjoy the status of freedom within the colony. They faced limitations on employment opportunities and were barred from providing testimony in legal proceedings. Notably, these oppressive laws did not apply to whites. The intended and inevitable outcome was a deterioration in the rapport between poor blacks and poor whites, fostering sentiments of superiority among the latter and resentment among the former. The strategic intent behind these legal measures was to prevent unity among the lower classes, thereby averting any potential challenge to the ruling elite. By sowing division based on the superficial characteristic of skin color and codifying it within the law, the colonial authorities ensured that poor whites would align themselves more closely with the elite. Despite greater economic and social similarities with African Americans. This calculated strategy laid the groundwork for systemic racial segregation in America, a phenomenon that had enduring implications. It is a sobering realization that the roots of racism in this country can be traced back to economic and power dynamics orchestrated by plantation elites in contemporary times. While there have been notable advancements with African Americans attaining high political offices, racial tensions remain and predominantly persist, especially within the lower socioeconomic strata, where the similarities are greatest. The historical precedent set by the elite during Bacon's rebellion continues to influence the perpetuation of privilege and the maintenance of authority. We must acknowledge the ongoing presence of white privilege within our society. The difficulty in acknowledging such privilege often stems from its invisibility to those who benefit from it, whereas those deprived of it are acutely aware of its existence. There are voices today who argue that racist elements of our past should not be taught to avoid discomfort among innocent students over the actions of their ancestors. Essentially, what they're saying is that white students should not be made to feel uncomfortable about race. In response, I would argue that black students have always had to feel discomfort about american history and that the discomfort by either black or white students arises from an essential acknowledgment of injustice. I think we should feel uncomfortable about damnable events of the past. I do. That is not to say that any of us should blame ourselves or our contemporaries for crimes committed by our ancestors, but that recognizing injustice will motivate us to work toward a more just present and future. Do not allow discomfort to deter your engagement with these critical issues. They remain integral to understanding the complex fabric of our nation's past and present.
