Okay. Well, let's talk a little bit about Andrew Jackson's presidency. Okay. And his big issue. Andrew Jackson's big political issue is that he is opposed to the bank. He's opposed to the national bank. Now keep in mind that Andrew Jackson is from Tennessee. Let's see if we can think about what we learned on Monday and discover why Andrew Jackson would be against the national bank. First off, we want to wonder, is Tennessee north south or west? South. We would think of it as south today, but it was west then, right. It was in the west. All right, so Andrew Jackson comes from the west and he's opposed to the national bank. I wonder why. Why would that be? Because it was negative for the west. Why? Why was it negative for the west? Because they needed the. The credit to buy real estate. Real estate and land and stuff. And National bank would kind of make that a bit harder for them. Right. National bank made it harder for them to get credit. Okay. Exactly. All right. So. So he's very much against the national bank, but when it comes to tariffs, because he's from the west, he doesn't care about the national tariffs. Right. And so Congress is going to start to enact new and more restrictive tariffs during the 1820s and 1830s. And does anybody remember what was the purpose of tariffs? We talked about protective tariffs to tax imports and exports. What was the reason for it? We were calling protective. Oh, to protect, like, american. The american economy and stuff. Exactly. Encourage, like, the making of goods in America. Exactly. So it supports american industry. But who does it hurt? Sorry? Who does. Who do protective tariffs hurt? I like self sustaining economies like the south who relied on exporting like cotton. Okay, so then what happens is that Jackson. This is not Jackson. Jackson doesn't really care about the tariffs. And so they go ahead and they go through. But the south is incensed. The south is dead set opposed to these tariffs. And eventually what happens with the passing of a new tariff called the southerners call the tariff of abominations. There's a sense among many people, particularly in the south, that the state government actually takes precedence over the national government. Okay. And this is an argument that's been in place since the very beginning, because the constitution can be interpreted to not say which government is actually supreme. The constitution has a supremacy clause, but the understanding of the constitution is that it limits the powers of the federal government to what the constitution provides. And so it can be supreme in every place where it has jurisdiction, but still have the state governments be supreme in everything else. You guys follow? I'm saying here. And so many of the states who are feeling the negative consequences of these new tariffs are going to start talking about, well, we shouldn't even have to follow them. We can nullify them. Right? So the idea here is that they believe that it. That they can. That if the federal government tries to impose a law that goes against the interests of the state, the state can nullify that law. Okay. And again, this goes all the way back. Thomas Jefferson actually was in favor of the idea of nullification. Okay, so at any rate, so in 1832, after they enact this new tariff, the state of South Carolina is going to enact an ordinance of nullification. The ordinance of nullification essentially says that the tariffs are nullified, they're not going to enact, they're not going to enforce the tariff, and that they threatened to secede from the union. Okay, so now the one thing I want you guys to understand now is that, is that South Carolina is as far south as you can go before the civil war. What do I mean by that? If I say South Carolina is as far south as you go, as you can go, what am I saying? Is that true? Geographically? No. But as far as the state's rights are concerned, that nothing passes. That South Carolina, essentially that South Carolina becomes the symbol of states rights and white supremacy. Right. South Carolina becomes the symbol states rights and white supremacy. Okay, so now South Carolina says we're not going to collect the tariff. Jackson, who, as I already mentioned, didn't really care about the tariff, but does care about the union, threatens to intervene in South Carolina militarily. And the result of it is that there is a compromise. A bunch of people come together, Jackson, this handsome fellow here, John Calhoun, and congressional leaders come together and they negotiate a reduction in the tariffs. And so then the South Carolina repeals the nullification act. Right. Nullification ordinance. Okay, you guys are with me. So now the outcome of it is that the South Carolina doesn't succeed and the tariffs are reduced. Okay, who wins? The south. Well, didn't the tariffs get reduced? Tariffs got reduced. Is that what they really want? What do they really want? They didn't want to pay the tariff at all. They don't want any tariffs. Right. So did they get what they wanted? Yeah. What about. What about the national government in this case, represented by Jackson? Did he get what he wanted? Yes. What did he want? For South Carolina to stay. To stay and pay a little bit of the tariff and pay all the tariff. Right. So did they get what they wanted? The push? Did. Did the north get everything they wanted? Did the congress, the national government get everything they wanted? What did they want? We just said it. They wanted South Carolina to stay in the union and wanted them to pay all of the tariffs, right. Or collect all the tariffs. And did they get that? Yes. No, they didn't. Because remember, the tariffs were reduced, right? So they didn't get everything they wanted. They got some of what they wanted, but they didn't get everything they wanted. Right? You guys get what I'm saying here? And the south, did they get everything they wanted? Remember, they wanted no tariffs at all, right? Did they get everything they wanted? No, they didn't get everything they wanted. That's what compromise means. You don't get everything, but you get something. You see what I'm saying? And it keeps the union together. But now I want you to think, I know you guys are having a hard time getting the old brain fired up this morning, but I, but I want you to think about this and I'm not going to answer it for you. And that is, what question is left unanswered in terms of the relationship between the national government and the state government? Who has more power? Exactly. Which government is supreme? So essentially the essential question here really wasn't the tariff. The essential question was which government is supreme? Is it the national government or is it the state government? And they made a compromise, but the compromise didn't settle that question, which means that that question will come up again later. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. I've made you suffer enough. Go away. Live long and prosper.
