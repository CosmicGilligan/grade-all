So now, here's the thing. If you go to the Barnes and noble today, I actually believe it's still open here in Encinitas. I can't believe anybody still goes to bookstores. But at any rate, if you go to the Barnes and noble and you go into the history section, you will find one shelf of books about World War two, one shelf of books about everything else, and all the rest of the shelves are going to be filled with books about the civil War. Civil war is one of the most studied eras in world history. And so the idea that in something around an hour, we're going to talk about the civil War is really ridiculous. There's no way we can come even close to covering it. But I do want to take a kind of a 50,000 foot view of it to give us, to put it in context with the rest of the class that we've been leading up to this, really, since the very beginning. All right, so that's where we're going. It's not like you're going to know very much about the civil war from listening to this lecture, but you'll have a basic idea. Okay, are you, are you guys with me? Questions, comments about anything? All right, so let's go ahead and take a look then at the north and south. Okay, but let me just mention, one of the things that occurred to me this morning as I was thinking about doing this lecture was we had talked earlier when we talked about the, the election of 1800, how compromise was necessary for democracy to survive. That if Jefferson had not been able to compromise with Hamilton, the country would have died in 1800. But they both were able to make very hard compromises, and because of that, the country survived. We have here a situation where there's a great divide between regions of the country, the north and the south. And there's really fundamental differences in the economies and the culture, the north and the south, that we've already spent some time talking about. The north was an industrial, manufacturing, commercial economy, engaged in world trade, and the south was a plantation, kind of a traditional plantation economy, engaged in export agriculture. So the policies of the country, of the national government tended to favor the north because the population of the north was greater than the population of the south. And the south then believed that because of that, that they were really getting short shrift and being part of this union. And, and if you guys will recall, I mean, going back to the very beginning, the fact that there was a union at all was, I mean, there was a lot of reluctance on the part of particularly the southern states to join in this union, and there's no way they would have joined into the union if they had thought they couldn't get out of it. Right, but that's been a theme, something that we've been looking at over the. Over, really, the last several weeks. And so what happens is that there's a hardening of sentiment between the north and the south, and the hardening of the sentiment is going to focus on slavery. And the reason why slavery becomes the issue is because the north is. The economy of the north is not dependent on slavery like the economy of the south is. And there is a growing sentiment among people that slavery is a moral evil, particularly people in the north. And so the issue of the expansion of slavery and even the abolition of slavery has been a growing issue over the entire period of time that the United States has existed. And remember that the United States was really the first application of the principles of the enlightenment. And the enlightenment includes the idea that all men are created equal, and that, therefore, there should be no slavery. There's no such thing as an inferior person who should be owned by somebody else. All right, so this is a. It's not just an american movement. It's actually the abolitionist movement started in England, but it's. By the time we get to the 1850s, it's. It's very strong in the United States. Okay, so. So then the issue then of slavery and union becomes an issue that can't be compromised on. The south will not compromise on slavery at all. If you guys will recall, the platform of the republican party was to limit the expansion of slavery. Not to do away with slavery, but to limit the expansion of slavery. And the south will not accept that because they'll say that the United States government can't legislate on private property. They'll say that, like when the american colonies rebelled against England over the issue of taxes, which was really the government taking their property without their consent, that if you allow the federal government to legislate on the ownership of private property, that's the same exact sin, I guess you could say, on the part of the central government. So the south will not compromise on the issue of slavery in terms of union. Abraham Lincoln is elected president with the intention of saving, not saving the union, but preserving the union. And that is an issue that he refuses to compromise on. So what we have reached, then, at this point, is an impasse that the south can't compromise on slavery and the north can't compromise on union. And because there is the inability to compromise, what we see is a break. We see a war that comes out of it. You guys, you guys are following me here. Now, one of the reasons why it's so important that we study history is that we learn, theoretically, what works and what doesn't work. And if we have a national government today in which different parties refuse to compromise, we can't preserve our democracy. Do you guys follow what I'm saying here? One of the things that's emblematic of current politics is the idea that compromise has become a bad word. Compromise is something that is looked at as weakness. But in fact, if it is weakness, it's the only weakness that will keep the union together.
