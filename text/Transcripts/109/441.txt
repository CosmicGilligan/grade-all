Today we're going to talk about, instead of the expansion of the franchise, we're going to talk about expansion of the geographical extent of the United States, and we're going to see how all of the territories, almost all of the territories west of Louisiana purchase, get added to the United States in a period of time and the creation of the border with Mexico. All right, questions, comments about any of this? All right, so let's talk about first manifest destiny. You guys have heard of manifest destiny before. What is it? Isn't it that the colonists kind of believed that it was like their divine right to that land? Okay, so that's. That's exactly what you guys mostly have been taught. We're not really talking about colonists now. We're talking about the Americans. Right, but the idea that we've been taught is that manifest destiny was the american people's God given right to control the north american continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. And that is actually what it comes to mean in a certain sense. But like everything else in american history, there's really two different applications, I guess you could say, of the. Of the term manifest destiny. All right, so on the one hand, there is that kind of economic aspect that we've talked about that says that all of this territory should be added to the United States. So that can add to the economic vitality of the United States. But the original idea of manifest destiny was actually an ideological thing. All right? And the way that we can understand this ideology is to think about the term temple of liberty. Okay? So the temple of liberty was a way that Americans described the federal system. The federalist system. Right. So now I'm going to actually invite another five minutes of silence by asking you, what is federalism? It's like how powers divided between a national government, for example. Like a state government. Exactly. So that's what we've been. One of the themes that we've had ever since the beginning was that there was. That there was a disconnect between, or a disconnect in the understanding of the powers of the federal government versus the state government. And that's the issue of federalism. Right, but the idea behind federalism is that you have a national government that does all of the things that the state governments can't do, and then everything that the state governments can do, they do. All right, so the federalist system in the United States is set up in such a way that the states are considered to be individual countries, and they have all the rights and privileges of a country except for those that can't be accomplished along with the other states. So the. Well, the way that a state would get added to the federal government, we've talked about this before, having to do with the Northwest ordinance, is that the national government, the Congress, creates a territory, and people move into the territory. And then once enough people are in the territory, they convene a convention. The. They create a government and write a constitution, and then they apply for admission to the union, in this case, either as slave or free. Okay, so the idea then is that states can be added to the union, but before they can be added to the union, they have to be ready. And how states can be added to the union, how they can be ready is by being democratic, by having a democratic government, by having a liberal, what we call classically liberal government or a government under a constitution. So the United States can add new countries, but every country that's added has to be a constitutional gov. Has to have a constitutional government. You can't add a monarchy or a theocracy that can't be part of the United States, because the United States is. Is a. Is a almost, I guess you could say confederation or union of individual countries that are all democratic. All right, you guys get what I'm saying? So that aspect of the american system that every state has to be democratic is described by earlier by Americans during the period we're talking about as the temple of liberty, because every state that's added to the United States has to have or demonstrate or practice what we have called liberty. Okay. And if. I hate to do this, but we go all the way back to the very beginning of the course, and we talk about what is liberty. Remember, liberty with an exclamation point is democracy, secularism, capitalism, the government style of the United States called classical liberalism. All right, you guys are all with me on this. Questions? Comments? So what characterizes all of the states together is liberty. And. And the way that a state can be added to the union is by being. By. By practicing, by putting into practice the ideas of liberty. You guys get what I'm saying? So that means that the United States, according to the people who lived at the time, they view the United States as the temple of liberty. So now let's think for a minute about if. Let's say that. I mean, think about this is actually religious. They're thinking about this in religious terms. All right, so let's think about if there was a religion and they had a temple, and you were walking down the street one day and you look inside the temple and you see what's going on in there? You say, I think I'd like to be part of that. So how would that. How would you become a part of that temple? Well, you would go into the temple and you'd find out what they were doing and you'd figure out how to practice it. And then after some period of time, they'd ask you if you believed on all the things that they believed in, and you'd practice all the things that they practiced. And if you said yes, you'd be in. Right. But if you went in and said, I don't really believe any of this stuff, but I want to be part of it anyway, they wouldn't let you in. You get what I'm saying? And the other part of it is that they don't go out on the street and beat people over the head and drag them in. You see what I'm saying? It's voluntary. And not only is it voluntary, but you have to be ready. This is the way people thought about adding territories to the union, is that these territories can be added to the union, but they have to demonstrate liberty, right? They have to be ready. Okay. And, and so what that means, if you think about that, is that the original concept of manifest destiny is not an ideology of conquest. It's not the idea that it's just out there and you can take it. It means that that territory can be added, but only when it's ready. Okay, you guys follow I'm saying here? So now let's think about that in terms. Let me just. I don't remember what I wrote here. Yeah. So, so what we see here then is the two kind of understandings of manifest destiny around the period of time that we're talking about. The first one, this, this article in United States magazine Democratic Review, is the first time that the words manifest destiny are actually appear in print. And there, John L. O'Sullivan describes manifest destiny, America's manifest destiny, to overspread the continent. By the, by the way that I just talked about, the advance guard, irresistible army of anglo saxon immigration armed with a plow on the rifle, markings trail with schools and colleges, courts and representatives, halls, mills and meeting houses. All of this means that they are getting ready. They are becoming ready. Okay. And what's being talked about here is the annexation of Texas, which we're going to talk about in just a couple of minutes, right. Because people are saying that Texas, when Texas was originally applied for statehood, they were denied. And now John L. O'Sullivan is saying they are ready. And how can they be ready? What do they have to demonstrate to be ready to be part of the United States? Liberty. Liberty, exactly. All right. Now, on the other hand, and this happens during the mexican american war, which is another thing going to talk about in just a couple minutes, is this senator William Gilpin, who said, who described manifest destiny this way, the untransacted destiny of the american people is to subdue the continent, to rush over this vast field to the Pacific Ocean. Divine task, immortal mission. Let us trade fast and joyfully on the open trail before us, but every american heart open wide for patriotism to glow undimmed, to confide with religious faith in the sublime and prodigious destiny of his well loved country. All right, so that doesn't sound like the kind of more cautious approach that manifest destiny originally had, but it sounds more like an ideology of conquest, doesn't it? It sounds more like the United States has been granted by God the destiny of subduing the north american continent. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So there's really two different definitions here. And the reason why I bring that up is because this fits with the american system, if you guys will remember, when we're going all the way back to the Washington administration, there are two very different visions of what kind of a country the United States is. Is it a temple of liberty? Is it a temple of. Is it a place, a landscape of liberty, where people can practice their individual rights? Or is it a place where you can make lots of money? Is it an economic powerhouse? Right? And that split remains in every aspect of american politics. So we see it in the break between Jefferson and Hamilton. We see it in the foreign policy of the United States, which on the one hand, stands for liberty and justice, and on the other hand, becomes an imperial power. Right. And here we see it in our, in our concept of how we acquire the west. Okay, are you guys following me saying here there's two different aspects, the ideological and the. And the economic. And acquiring territory for the sake of acquiring territory is driven by economics. Okay, because you want what's on the land. Okay. Or you want the land.
