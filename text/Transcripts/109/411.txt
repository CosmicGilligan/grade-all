I'd like for you guys to remember what was the last thing we talked about last Monday? Somebody tell me the revolution of 1800. What was the revolution of 1800? On my notes, I had written down that it was Adams versus Jefferson, and then the electoral college got split between Jefferson and Burr. And then the election ended up going to the house. Exactly. Exactly. And what, how did, how was the election finally resolved? You're absolutely right on it, Sean. There was a compromise that led to the election of Jefferson. Okay. All right. And the compromise was between who and who? You're right. Absolutely. Jefferson. And who was his great antagonist? Hamilton. Hamilton, exactly. Do you guys remember, this is important. You should remember this. Right. The first party system. This was the way that the different visions of the country split themselves apart during the Washington administration. So if you remember, Hamilton was secretary of the treasury, Jefferson was secretary of state. But they had very different visions. The country. And that Hamilton thought that the country should be a great industrial, commercial power, and Jefferson thought it should be a landscape of liberty. He was more idealistic. And so then we saw that that led to two different views. On the one hand, the people that followed Hamilton were known as federalists. They were mostly in the northeast because that was really the industrial center of the United States. Some of the most more famous federalists were Washington and Adams, and they wanted a strong central government so that they could encourage commerce and industry. And then they wanted to enact plans that weren't particularly specified in the constitution, like a national bank. And so they, they thought that the constitution was a. Like a framework that could be added to. Okay, you guys remember this? Questions? Comments? Okay, because I'm going to come back and I'm going to ask you again. And, you know, these long, pregnant silences are kind of uncomfortable for everybody, so you should be able to answer these questions. Right. All right, so next, then we have the people that followed Jefferson were democratic Republicans, is what they call themselves sometimes just Republicans. Some of the more famous of them were Madison and Monroe. You'll hopefully recall that James Madison was the one who really kind of encouraged or promoted the new constitution. They believe that the government, the government, that if there should be any government at all, it should be closer to the people. So they thought the state should be supreme in the federal system. And they also believe that the Constitution was specific in the powers that it granted to the federal government. It couldn't be. Couldn't be. What's the word I'm looking for? It couldn't be. It couldn't be broken. You could only go by what the constitution said and nothing else. Right. Now, let me just make kind of an observation about legal practice today, and that will be that there are still people who call themselves strict constructionists and loose constructionists. And when we look at the court system today, the federal court system and the Supreme Court, it is the more conservative justices who call themselves strict constructionists. Okay. Now. And then it's more liberal justices that say, no, the Constitution is a living document that needs, that can be, that can be interpreted to mean things that weren't intended actually originally. Like, for example, same sex marriage. Same sex marriage wasn't something that was an issue in 1787. So it wasn't in the Constitution. But loose constructionists will say, yeah, well, we could find that right in the constitution because it evolved, whereas strict constructionists would say, well, it's not in the Constitution, so you can't say anything about it. You guys get what I'm saying? You guys follow that? Questions? Comments? All right. Well, this is important, really, in terms of what it's important to be a citizen. Now, most of the Republicans, but not all of them were in the south. There were some Republicans in, like, for example, Pennsylvania. Right. And New York. Actually, Aaron Burr was from New York. Right. But the difference in terms of the economy between the two was that Jefferson believed in an agricultural economy but not a plantation economy. Right. So even though the south was a plantation economy, vision of his, of his country wasn't plantation agriculture but single family farms, which is something that we're going to talk about here in just a few minutes. All right. So you guys get the difference between the two, the split between the two, right. And I think that I may have already mentioned and that we'll continue to look at the split actually really can be boiled down to a country that is an economic powerhouse or a country that is a bastion of liberty, a kind of a, what's the word I'm looking for? More of a beacon of liberty. Right. And keep in mind that we talked about the liberal revolution, the idea that the united, the american revolution was the beginning of this revolution of liberty that would be spread throughout the world. So the United States was a, a revolutionary government that exported revolution around the world. Okay. Questions? Comments? Can we think of any countries that are like that today, any countries that are trying to export revolution? I'm not sure if this country applies, but Hong Kong, I believe, well, they are struggling for democracy, but they're not trying to export revolution. Okay. When we think about a country that's, that's trying to export revolution, generally, speaking, most countries that are more conservative will be very much against them. Right. And I'm not saying that because you do export revolution. That's a good thing. Right. But I do. I do think that there's at least one country today that's very heavily involved in the idea of spreading revolution. Iran. Iran. Exactly. Iran is trying to spread its islamic revolution. Right. So the way that countries of the world looked at the United States then, is very much the way that the countries of the world look at Iran today. You guys follow what I'm saying? Okay, I know that's uncomfortable for you, but that's just to kind of emphasize to you how radical the american experiment was at that time. Okay. Questions? Comments about any of that? Okay, let's go a little bit further now, and let's think about the relationship between Hamilton and Jefferson. Hamilton and Jefferson almost went to fistfights in the White House during the Washington administration, and they came to really despise each other and the people that followed Hamilton came to despise the people that followed Jefferson and vice versa. Right. So it was not. Okay, well, you guys believe one thing and we believe something else, but we all believe that were good Americans. It was the people who were the Hamiltonians or the federalists thought that the democratic Republicans were a bunch of wild eyed liberals. Wild eyed revolutionaries. Right. And the Democratic Republicans thought that the federalists were a bunch of monarchists. Okay, now let's try to put that in contemporary terms. What that would mean would be that the democratic Republicans thought that the federalists were Nazis and the federalists thought that the democratic Republicans were communists. Okay? They didn't have Nazis and communists back then, but it was the same kind of split. Do you guys get what I'm saying here? Questions? Comments? And so then the idea here wasn't that if we lose the election, well, that's too bad. We'll come back next time and try again. The idea was that if the country continues under the rule of either side, depending on which side you're on, it's the end. The country's going to end. Right. So Jefferson believed that because of the kind of monarchist tendencies of the federalists, that it might be. Might be necessary for there to be a new revolution. And Hamilton, the people that followed Hamilton believed that if Jefferson took over, it would be the end of the country. He would sell the country out to the French. You see what I'm saying? So when there was this election in 1800 between Jefferson and Adams. Okay, so Jefferson ran. Hamilton didn't run. He was more like a kind of a background figure, but he was the really chief of the Federalists. But Adams ran against Jefferson. Right. And we see then these two very different visions of the country coming up for a vote. Okay? And the outcome of the election was that the Federalists would never win according to the. According to the constitution, because Adams didn't get as many electors as either Jefferson or his running mate, Aaron Burr. So the outcome of the election had to be either Jefferson or Burr. But we'll recall that because they didn't, nobody got a majority, that the election went to the house and the house was controlled by federalists. And so what ended up happening was that there was a stalemate in the house where. Where they kept taking votes, and this over a period of about a month. And they kept taking votes and the votes always came out the same. It was a tie between Jefferson and Burr. And Adams came in third every time. Right? So the way that. That. Well, eventually what ended up happening was that the republican governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania threatened to call up the troops to install Jefferson as president. And the outcome of that, essentially was that Jefferson and Hamilton made a secret deal. And the secret deal was that Jefferson would be elected president and then Jefferson would leave in place the federalist financial system, which included the national bank, which was something that the democratic Republicans thought was completely unconstitutional. But they made this hard compromise, and Jefferson then was elected president. And so the election of 1800, which was the first time that there was a change in the kind of direction of the government was handed, was accomplished peacefully without any bloodshed. Now, when we look at that, we say, well, that's no big deal. I mean, that happens all the time. It has always happened in american history, and it's almost always true. But. But this was the first time that that had ever happened that it was possible. Whenever there was one party in power and the other party gained power, then there was always bloodshed to determine who was going to win, right? And although this was really, they didn't really have this experience with democracy, but if we look later at the latin american revolutions, at the revolution in Mexico and Argentina and anywhere, and even in France, right, when they have the revolution there, the idea was that when one party, when there's an election and the party in power loses the election, then they always declared the election to be a fraud and they ended up fighting it out. Right? And then the result of that was that the vote really didn't matter. It was just a prelude to a war that happened every election. You guys get what I'm saying, but that didn't happen in the United States. And what that means is that the United States proved that it was possible for democracy to work. That's the example of the validity of democracy. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So this is an incredibly important event in world history that the United States was able to survive this crisis of elections. And what happens then to these two different visions of the United States is that this becomes the big question for american politics from then all the way through. So the question really here is going to be between, I think, economics and idealism, right. And instead of fighting it out in the streets, people fight it out in the ballot boxes. Right. And so as we go through american history, we can see that sometimes the people who are. Who are promoting a strong economy are triumphant, and sometimes the people who are more liberal are triumphant, but it goes back and forth, and it's always a peaceful transfer between them. You guys get what I'm saying? So what the election of 1800 did was it institutionalized that conflict between the two visions of the country. And that's why those two visions of the country are still there today. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? That some people think that the United States should exercise its power for the benefit of the american economy, and some people think that the United States should be a beacon of freedom, liberty and justice. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about any of this? So this is the basis, then, for american politics. And it's also the proof that democracy can work. Although I have to say, and I've mentioned this before, that this happens in America, in the United States at 1800, doesn't happen anywhere else for the next 75 years. For the next 75 years, whenever there's an election where one party loses control to another, they always fight it out everywhere that you look. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about that? What do you guys think? Any questions? Comments? Yeah, I have a quick question. Okay, good. So would the threat of military action if Jefferson wasn't put in power, would that sort of be like if today, like if the Capitol invasion would have just been a threat, or was it kind of a different idea? Okay, so the difference between what happened this year and what happened then is that essentially what happened this year was an extra judicial mob, meaning that it wasn't organized by any government. Okay. There were organizations involved, but it was outside the government. And where we saw in the election of 1800, we had governments that were actually raising militia to accomplish this. You see the difference? But the idea essentially is the same. The idea is that if you don't like the outcome of the election, then you use force to overturn it. Do you see what I'm saying? Although I will say that what happened this year was that people were against what happened. The people that invaded the capital were against the outcome of the revolution of the election, and the armies in 1800 were in favor of the change of power. You guys get what I'm saying? You get what I'm saying? So those are the differences. Yeah. But anytime, anytime that you want to use force to overturn the will of the people, that would be something that would be a threat to democracy. Okay. Thank you. And it really sets a bad example for the democratic system, a bad precedent. All right. Questions, comments? That's a good question, Sean. Thank you. Any other questions.
