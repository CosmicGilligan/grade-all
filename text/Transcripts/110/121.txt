We're going to go back in time, and we're going to go all the way to the Middle Ages, and we're going to look at the land tenure system during the Middle Ages. So the land tenure system was called feudalism, and it was based on what's called the thief, right? The thief was an area of land. Now, if we think about in a kingdom, the king owned all the land, all right? But what he did was his special people that helped him. The Lords got access to certain areas of land, and the area of land that the lord would get was called a thief. Okay? Now, as far as I know, there was never a square thief anywhere in Europe. This is just a kind of a depiction of the thief, right? And what we'll see then in the thief is the social order of the Middle Ages, right? And there's a village, and then there's an area of land called the fields of the Lord. And that's where the Lord lives in his manner. Right? And the rest of the land is called commons. Should we be taking notes on this? We heard of the Commons, Boston Common. For now, the way it works is that the Lord has access to the produce of the land, all right? What that means is that he doesn't own the land and he doesn't own the people, but he has rights to the people's labor, okay? And as having rights to the people's labor, what that means is that the people owe him labor in return for his protection, but also being allowed to use the commons to grow their own produce. Right? So they grow grains and sheep and things like that, right? The kind of ideal of the Middle Ages was that the peasants would work in the fields of the Lord and produce. Produce, right? Agricultural goods that they would sell, and then the lord would make money off of that. And in return for that, the commoners would work in the fields for their own goods. Right? Later, what happens is that the lords will figure out they can't make very much money by selling vegetables. So they basically allow the peasants to get money however they want. And then the peasants, instead of paying labor, they pay rent in cash. So that's why you pay rent to the landlord. Okay, you guys are with me. Okay? All right. So now it's an agrarian system, right? And the basis of wealth here is in the land. And because the land is controlled by the Lord, then that means that the Lord controls essentially all the wealth or the other way around. Okay, you guys got this questions? Should we be taking notes on this even though this isn't. I'm sorry, I can't hear. Can you say it again? Should we be taking notes on this? Yes, absolutely. Let me go ahead and move on then. And I'm going to say this is an agrarian system. And even though it's an agrarian system, and most of the produce is agricultural, like sheep, stuff like that, right? And also this system basically is what they would call a subsistence system. And the reason why it's a subsistence system is because people make just enough for everybody to live, right? So you need everybody in the village to grow enough produce for everybody to live. All right. That's why we call it subsistence. You guys with me? Everybody's needed. All right? Okay. Now, even though it's an agrarian system, they still have industry. Okay? The industry, they have to make things, right? Some things that they need to make, like cannons and stuff like that, have to be made up in the hills because that's where the water power is, right? But stuff that you need for the home, like horseshoes and pots and pans and hats and shoes and things like that, are made in the village in a cottage. So what that means is that the peasant will have a cottage, and in the cottage he will have a. Sorry. In the cottage, he will have some kind of a tool to make something. So you might have an anvil, so you can make horseshoes or something like that, right? The example that we're going to use is going to be textiles, right? So the british empire essentially was based on woolen textiles or cotton. So let's say a textile would be something like a sweater. And if you needed a sweater made, you would go to the person in the village who made sweaters, and that person would have a loom. And what you would do is you would tell the person, I want a sweater. And they'd measure you up, and you'd give them some money, and they'd say, okay, come back in three days or four days or whatever, right? And when you come back, then I'll give you your sweater, right? And then the person in the cottage would use the loom to create the sweater. And then when the person came back to get their sweater, they would just get a perfect sweater because it fits them perfectly, because it was made just for them. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay, so that's what we call a cottage industry. Why do we call it cottage industry? Because it happens in the cottage, right? And in the cottage industry, we make a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Small quantity. Because you can only make one thing at a time. One person, one loom makes one thing. Right? High quality because it's made just for you, and reasonable price. Because if it wasn't reasonable, you couldn't afford it. Right. Basically, the industrial output was a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Okay. Now, one thing that we want to notice is that if I'm the peasant that owns the loom that creates the sweater, okay, what do I get in return for making that sweater? Money. Profit. Sorry, money. The profit or the surplus. Right. So you buy the wool and you put your labor in, and the money that's left over, that's what you get to keep. And why do you get keep it? Because you own the loom. I.
