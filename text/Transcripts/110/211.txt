Today, we're going to actually start talking about politics in the United States. So we've talked about industrialization, we've talked about the movement into the west, and some talk about historiography, and now we're going to talk about industrialization or about politics. And one of the things about the politics of this era is that it is obscure for us. I mean, this era between 1870 and, say, 1915 or so is obscure for us because the issues that happened during that time weren't big issues like what happened before the Civil War. The Civil War, they had issues like the tariffs, and they had issues of, can states secede from the Union? States have to follow federal law, slavery. All these things were big issues that we spend a lot of time talking about in american history. But the latter part of the 19th century, we don't spend that much time talking about. And so it's kind of a political black hole in a way. All right. But there's a couple of different reasons for that, which I'll talk about as we go into it. This era is going to be called the gilded age. Does anybody know what gilded means? Gilded means coded. Right. Coded. Exactly. So coded in gold. Say, for example. Right. If you had, like, a gilded chair. Right. The gilded chair could be made out of cheap wood and painted over, and then it's got a little gold leaf or not just gold paint on it. It makes it look like it's gilded, like it's actually got gold on it, but it doesn't necessarily have to have gold on it. Right. It could be just gold paint or whatever. So what that means is that the chair looks like it's very expensive, but it's really not. It's really cheap. You know what I mean? And what we see happening is that the gilded outside covers up the less attractive inside. Okay? And that's what we see with american life during this era because it's an era of rapid industrialization. So we're going to see some people become incredibly wealthy. Right? We're going to see some people in the United States become more wealthy than the emperor of China, but we'll also see massive amounts of people who are living in poverty and being exploited at the same time. So there's this era of not just income inequality, but really mass inequality, and that creates social upheaval. I think this is a good illustration of the era where you have the millionaires here at the top fields, Goulds, Vanderbilt, and they're sitting on top of their millions, and they're being held up by the workers who are making $3 a week or $11 a week, something like that. Okay. This is the kind of the flavor of this era in american politics, and it's in american history, I should say. But it's sadly also representative in many ways of today because we have massive income inequality today. We have a very small number of people who own enormous amounts of wealth and a huge amount of people who own nothing or close to nothing. Right. I think that we could learn a lot from the gilded age and the progressive era that we're going to be talking about on Wednesday. All right. Well, going back to then saying that politics was not something that we spend a lot of times thinking about, we have to look at how did people consider the government. If I ask you what's going on in the government today as far as what we elected Biden, who's trying to pass the stimulus, extend unemployment, I know Trump is trying to do something with impeachment. Correct. That's all over. But that's a great answer. I appreciate that answer. Here's the reason why it's so important that you answered the way that you did, because both of you guys are talking about what's going on with the federal government, right? So when I say the government, you think the national government. But at the time we're talking about in the 1860s, if I said the government, you wouldn't think about the national government. You would think about your local government. So it would be the city government, the county government, maybe the state government, but the federal government. You knew there was one, but it was far away. It really didn't have any influence on your life. Okay. How many of you guys know who the mayor of San Diego is? Kevin Falcon. That's the old one. Yeah, the new one. But see, you guys are not sure. And how many of you guys know who represents you on the city council? You don't know. Right. So it's really the opposite of that period of time where in that time you knew who was your representative on the city council. It was close to you. And if you really think about it, it makes more sense because if there's a pothole in your street, you're not going to call President Biden and say, look, I need somebody to come and fix my pothole. Right. You're going to call somebody in the city. Right. And so the local government is the government that has more influence on your life than the national government. You guys get what I'm saying? We'll talk more about that as we go through the course here. But the main thing is to understand that at that time, the national government wasn't the big government. And it doesn't become the big government until really it starts during World War I, and we start to see the beginnings of it in a big way during the Great Depression and World War II. We'll talk more about that again as we go through the course. But the point that I'm making is that the government wasn't really engaged in big issues or big issues that people really thought about very much. And the issues that it was engaged in were not, were kind of minor compared to the things that had happened before.
