The first thing we want to say, well, american imperialism. America doesn't have an empire, but America has essentially been imperialistic since the very beginning, even in the colonial period, because the definition that we're using for imperialism is that one country controls the resources of another country for its own economic benefit. All right? That's essentially what we mean by imperialism, and that's what drove imperialism in the 19th century. All of the industrial powers, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Japan, and the United States, will also become imperial powers driven by their industrial economies. Okay? So what we want to do, though, is american imperialism is going to be a bit different from european imperialism for a couple of reasons. And so what we want to do is go all the way back to think about, well, where do Americans actually start to be? Or how do Americans conduct foreign policy? All right? And to understand that, we go all the way back to the Washington administration, and Washington, as you guys knew, know, served two terms, and then he decided not to run again. Okay? And he set the precedent then for two terms in the presidency. But at the end of his presidency, he thought of himself kind of as an elected king. And the way that a king would have been thought of at that time, traditionally, was that the king was the father and the protector of the people. So when Washington retired from public office, he thought that it would be important for him to make. It would be important for him to leave his children with some. And so that's where we come to Washington's farewell address. It wasn't a speech. It was actually a document that was written. It was actually written by Alexander. But the point here is that it says what Washington. The advice that Washington wanted to leave Americans when he retired and find the whole document, it's not very long, it's very prescient, has a lot of really interesting things in it. And the two that we're really concerned about today is the way that Washington defined american foreign policy and american foreign policy. What we have to understand about America at the time of Washington's presidency or in the first years of the republic was that the United States was very weak and that United States was in the presence of two very powerful, antagonistic powers in Europe who were at each other's throats. That was England and France. Right. England and France both wanted the United States to be on their side in the wars between them, and they really did a lot of interfering in american politics. But Washington, realizing that America was weak, decided that United States should remain neutral, that United States should not pick sides, because his idea was that if the United States did pick sides, and they picked the wrong side. That would be the end of America, because either the French or the British could have destroyed. And so he says, we're going to stay out of Europe's affairs. But at the same time, Washington is going to say that we should insist on what he called unrestricted commercial ties or unrestricted free trade. And what that means is that we can trade with whoever we want to, right? And we're not going to be limited by european mercantilism. So if you guys remember, maybe you don't remember what mercantilism essentially was that the colonies could only trade with the mother country, right? And then the mother country could trade with other countries. But what the american system was the first system, really, that relied on what they call free trade, what we call unrestricted free trade, that any country could trade with any other country. So the United States insists on the ability to trade with any country that it wants. So these are the two main pillars, I guess you could say, of american foreign policy. On the one hand, we're not going to get involved in european affairs, and on the other hand, we are going to insist that we can trade with whoever we want. Okay? And sometimes those come into conflict. So, for example, the war of 1812 was about the British trying to keep the Americans from trading with the French. Okay? And the Americans insisted that they ought to be able to trade with the French. So the Americans went to war with the British, and we'll just leave it at that. America survived that. So that was an interesting episode. But at any rate, it shows us that the two principles actually sometimes go into conflict with each other. Okay. The thing about these principles is that they are going to remain almost as if it was law all the way up until, really world War I. United States will remain a continental power all the way up until World War I, with very few exceptions. Okay. But in 1824, there was a crisis in the Americas, and the crisis was that all of the spanish american colonies were breaking away from Spain. And Americans had two interests in these new countries that were breaking away from Spain. One of them was that the United States saw common cause with these revolutionary movements in Spanish America, because many of them were actually inspired by the american revolution. Right? So the Americans thought this was the progress of our revolution, that it's starting now, and it's going to eventually spread everywhere. This idea of liberty, the liberty that I defined for you on the second day of the class, I think, right? Liberty with an exclamation point. Okay. So there's this ideological affinity between North Americans and Spanish Americans. All right? But then there's another interest, and that is in trade. Because when the spanish colonies become independent, then they can trade with whoever they want. But when they're actually colonies of a european power, they can't. They have to trade only with that european power. So Americans are going to be very interested in maintaining the independence of spanish american countries because it helps them to maintain trading partners. All right, you guys get what I'm saying? So what we see then is we have two really different interests in the United States maintaining the independence of spanish american countries. One of them is ideological and one of them is economic. Okay? What we're going to notice is that american foreign policy will be characterized like american politics. American foreign policy will be characterized by that relationship between idealism and economics, right? So when it comes to foreign policy, the question is going to be, is the United States the beacon of freedom, liberty, justice and equality in the world, or is the United States a rapacious imperial predator? Right. And the answer to that question is going to be yes. Yes. The United States does believe in freedom, liberty, equality and justice, and they try to instill those principles in every place where they intervene. But at the same time, Americans want to make a lot of money just like the rest of the imperial powers. So the United States will act in the same way as many of the other industrial. So. So here's where the dilemma comes in for american foreign policy as compared to, say, for example, british foreign policy, right? So the british foreign policy is going to be the same, except that the British don't have this idea of spreading liberty, right? And the French and the Germans, they basically say, okay, we're here to get your stuff, and they're pretty much upfront about it, right, but Americans don't do that. Americans go and say, okay, we're here to make you all free and Democrats, and at the same time we're going to take your stuff, right? So it makes other people think that Americans are. American foreign policy is hypocritical. I mean, even Americans think that, all right, because we say, okay, well, you say that you stand for freedom, justice, liberty, equality in the world, but at the same time, you just come in and take our stuff like anybody else. Right? So you're really hypocritical. The truth is that american foreign policy isn't hypocritical. It's mentally unstable. It's a split personality. America has two personalities at once, and I think that's what makes american foreign policy so difficult for others to understand. But anyway, so the Monroe doctrine is going to say, okay, what happens is that Americans decide that they're going to impose their will on the Americas, and the way that they're going to do that is that they're going to declare this doctrine, doctrine was declared in 1824 when President Monroe was president, right? And Monroe doctrine will say that the Americas are close to new colonization, no new colonies in the Americas. But the quid pro quo will be that we're not going to establish any colonies in Europe. Okay? So now, if you think about 1824, here's this little country on the east coast of the north american continent telling these great european powers to stay out. What do you think those powers think about America's doctrine? They probably think it's ridiculous. How can you tell me what to do? Exactly. It's almost like if you think about, one of the ways I've tried to imagine it is if you went to the playground and you saw a sandbox there, and there's a little three year old in the sandbox saying, it's my sandbox, stay out, right? And what would you do? You say, well, that's a little brat, right? It's like, try stop me. Try stop me. Exactly. In 1824. Nobody took it serious in 1824, and there was no reason for them to. But United States, during the 19th century is going to become incredibly powerful, right? So that by 1900, the United States really is the most powerful industrial country on earth. Okay? When Americans said that they were going to enforce their will on the Americas, at first they couldn't, but then they could, right? And one of the, I think the height, really, of this idea of american hegemony. This is the word. It's kind of like a. It's domination. American domination of. Of the Americas comes in 1895, because there's a crisis that happens in South America, and I don't really have maps, I wish, but. But there's a crisis that happens in South America where there's Venezuela and there's British Guyana, a colony of Britain. And the border between those two countries had always been fluid. Nobody had ever really fixed the border and nobody really wanted to, because it wasn't country that was worth anything until somebody found gold there, right? And then all of a sudden, the Venezuelans say, oh, that's ours. It's always been ours, right? And the say, no, no, it's not, it's ours. And they threaten to send troops to America, but what happens is Venezuela actually calls upon the United States to support them in their conflict with Britain. And the Americans will make a statement based on the Monroe doctrine, which is called the only corollary to the Monroe doctrine. And what that corollary says is that the United States is practically sovereign in the Americas and its fiat is law. Okay? So now let's think about what does that mean? What does practically sovereign mean? Sovereign means like to rule over something. Correct? Right, exactly. So. So that says the United States is practically sovereign. What does that, you know, almost there. Well, that's one of the ways we think about it. But really, if you think about the word itself, it means in practice, right? It might not be official, but in practice it's there. Right? So in practice, the United States is sovereign over all of the Americas. What does that mean? That means the United States rules, right? And to what extent does the United States rule? Its fiat is law. So what is a fiat? I know it's a little italian car, but that's not what they were talking about, right? The fiat comes from the word. It's a latin word. Okay? If you look at the logo or the motto of the University of California, Fiat lux, let there be light. Right? So the idea, it comes from the biblical idea that God said something, and it was so God said, let there be light, and there was light. That's a fiat, right? So if America says this is so, it's so, essentially the United States claims godlike power over the Americas. You guys get what I'm saying? So this is going to be american foreign policy in the Americas, that the United States will consider itself to be sovereign in the Americas, and that the United States really is unchallenged in that. The outcome of the Venezuela boundary crisis that I was just telling you about was that the British backed off. And the reason why wasn't because they were afraid of the Americans so much that they had interest in other parts of the world and didn't want to get bogged down in a conflict in the Americas. Right? So what that really does, though, it feeds the Americas at the US sphere of influence.
