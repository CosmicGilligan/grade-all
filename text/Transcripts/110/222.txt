The problem was not just an american problem. It was a problem that happened in every industrializing nation. And so what happened was there was a development of different approaches to solve the problems of industrialization. And we're going to look at three today, and those three are going to be common. Communism, social Darwinism, and positivism. All right, I'm going to give you kind of a big picture overview of each of these and talk about where they were popular and where they were not popular. Okay, so communism was kind of summarized in a book that was written by this guy here, Karl Marx, and also his friend, the factory owner, Frederick Ingalls. And the idea behind communism was essentially what I have presented to you in class, which was that the problems of industrialization arose out of a shift in labor distribution and the means of production. So essentially the theory was that the owners, because of industrialization production, the means of production becomes more expensive. It's out of the reach of regular workers. And so only the wealthy can actually own the means of production. But because they own the means of production, they get the surplus from the labor. And then the people who actually work on the means of production only own their labor. And the result is that they get a subsistence wage, which is basically not really enough to live on. In fact, in some cases, it wasn't even a subsistence wage. All right? That part of the communist manifesto, which is the first part of it, actually ends up being true because it's a correct historical analysis of what happened in Western Europe. Okay? The rest of the communist manifesto is not true because what was predicted was that communism would. Because communism. Because capitalism created this new class, the proletariat, who were oppressed and unhappy. That because the nature of capitalism is that in order for a capitalist economy to be successful, it has to grow, right? So what that means is that we have to continue to produce more and more and more and more in order for capitalism to be healthy. And that means that we need more and more and more workers, right? So the theory then was that communism, that capitalism would continue to grow until the oppressed class was so big that they would spontaneously rise up and overthrow the owners and take away their stuff. And then at that point, they would transition control of the manufacturing, of the manufacturing, essentially, to the workers, everybody owning everything in common. And that would eventually lead to a worker's paradise. Right? So the idea here then about communism is that the workers are going to be so unhappy, eventually the workers will become so unhappy that they will violently overthrow the capitalist system and establish communism, which is, in essence, no government, right. Because the purpose of government, according to communists, is to enforce the rights of the bourgeoisie. So if there's no bourgeoisie, then there's no rights to enforce, and therefore people will just be happy ruling themselves. So that's the theory behind it. As we'll see later, there's good reasons why it doesn't really work. But for now, we can just say that what Marx predicted, well, first off, that the communist manifesto, or communism itself, was a response to the excesses of the industrial revolution, and that the way that it responded was that its prediction was that the industrial revolution would lead to so much social unrest that eventually the workers would overthrow the means of production, essentially the bourgeoisie. Right. Then their prediction was that communism wasn't something that might happen. It was something that would happen. It was inevitable. Right. And that when it was going to happen was when they actually wrote in 1848, and where it was going to happen was everywhere. Right? So the theory then was that the communist revolution was going to happen now, and it was going to happen everywhere. Okay? But now we have to ask ourselves, when did the communist revolution actually happen? Let me help you. Never. This worldwide revolution never happened, right? And so where did it happen? Nowhere. You guys get what I'm saying? So communism, when they predict that communist revolution is going to happen now and everywhere, but the communist revolution actually happens nowhere. And never and nowhere. That's a big problem in the theory, isn't it? And we'll talk more about that when we get into the 20th century, when the United States becomes officially kind of anti communist. Right? Okay. But anyway, communism is not going to be seen as a good solution for Americans because why? What happens to property in a communist system? You don't own any, right? Well, you do, actually. Everybody owns everything in common, right? So really, the idea behind communism is that rather than having private property ownership, that everybody would own everything in common, and that those people who had more would give voluntarily things to people who had less, so that everybody had enough. Right? So the problem with that then, is that sharing only seems like a good idea when you don't have anything, right? Let's say that you have a car and I don't have a car, then I think you should lend me your car. But if I have a car and you don't have a car, I think you should get your own car. You see what to share? We like to share things when we don't have anything, but when we have things we want to hold on to. So what we'll see happen is that communism will become popular in many places in Europe and other places in the world later, but not in the United States. And the reason why is because in the United States, people, even people who don't have property, believe that they can get it, that the United States is a land of opportunity, right? And all I need is my big break, or all I need to do is work a little harder or whatever, right? So there was a canadian scholar who commented on why communism never took off in the United States is because America doesn't have any poor people. We only have temporarily displaced millionaires, right? And at some point, we're all going to get rich. And that idea is what keeps us from adopting a concept of sharing everything. Because even though I don't have anything now, I might have something someday, and I don't want to have to share it with you. You see what I'm saying? So Americans don't like communism because Americans like stuff. We all have stuff, and we all want more stuff, and we want to hold on to our stuff. You follow what I'm saying? America, communism. It's not to say there never were communists in America. There were. Right. But in the big picture, communism was never a popular idea in the United States. Never has been. All right, so the next one is social Darwinism. Social Darwinism comes from Darwin's. Well, the idea of Darwinism. Let's talk about that. First. Darwin wrote a book in, he published in 1856 called the Origin of the Species. And in that book, he theorized that. Well, what was Darwin's theory? If you could sum up Darwin's theory in one sentence, what would it be? Survival of the fittest. Great. I'm glad you said that, because that's what we attribute to him, but that's not what he actually wrote. His purpose, essentially, was to argue in favor of the idea of evolution in the natural world. So it was more kind of scientific than it was social. But it was also from this rational point of view, right. Because up until this time, Christians had believed that everything that God created had existed from the very beginning and still existed, right. And it was unchanging. But what Darwin noticed when he started studying the fossil record in Argentina and then later in the Pacific islands is that over time, that there was evidence of creatures that once existed that no longer exist, right? And so his theory, first off, that counters the christian view that everything that exists always has existed, right? But his theory was that there were times when there was a change in environment that caused a crisis in the biological community, where some of the organisms adapted to the new environment and the rest of them couldn't adapt and they died out. Okay. That's where we get the idea of the survival of the fittest, because we assume that those organisms that survived were the fittest and the ones that didn't survive were not. But that's not what Darwin theorized. What Darwin theorized was that it was essentially random how some organisms survived and some didn't. He called it random selection. Right. But what we're going to see happen is that it's going to be a later group of people who will take the theories of Darwin and apply them to. So in Darwin, we could see maybe that the experiment would be that there were people in society or countries in the world. And we're going to see both of these this weekend, next week, too. Right. But today we'll think about people in society, that some people were able, that there was a change in environment. And the environment change was a change from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing economy, and that it created stresses on the social structure where some people were able to adapt and thrive in the new industrial environment. And some people could not adapt and they would not be able to survive. So according to the social Darwinist, all the stresses that are being caused by the industrial revolution are stresses that are natural and that people that are strong be able to adapt and survive. And those people who are suffering now, we should just let them die. Because if they die, then the ones that are left over are stronger. Right. So this process of evolution and letting the weak people die means that the society that emerges will be stronger because the weak people aren't there anymore. Right. So that's the essence of social Darwinism. When we look at it in the big picture, then how does it solve the problem? The way that it solves the problem is that it gets rid of all the people that are experiencing problems. They just die out. Right. And because of that, everybody that's left over is strong enough and they'll be able to survive and there won't be any social upheaval. All right, you guys get what I'm saying here? Okay, so it was actually the social Darwinist that came up with this idea of survival of the fittest. And then later Darwin went back and rewrote his book to include survival of the fittest in there. All right, what is the problem with the idea of social Darwinism? I mean, other than the fact that it's a monstrous ideology that you should just let suffering people die so that weaken society? Let's say one of the weaker members of society, as somebody who can't make a living in this new industrial society, right. Meaning they can't get food and they can't pay the rent and that sort of thing, what are those people going to do when they're suffering? Are they just going to lay down in the street and say, well, that's it, I'm done for, or what do you think they would do? What would you do? I'm sorry. Riot. Yeah, exactly. You would cause upheaval. Right. So the reality of social Darwinism is that in theory. Well, the theory of social Darwinism is that the weaker section will just die out. The reality of it is that they won't die out quietly, but they'll create a lot more upheaval in the meantime. And so then we may end up with creating the situation that makes marxist predictions. True. Right. So social Darwinism is, even though it was really adopted by a lot of intelligent people in the United States, it doesn't become something that Americans are very comfortable with. And I think that that idea is there for really two reasons. One is that moral reason that Americans don't look at people who are suffering, generally speaking, as a burden, but as people that need to be helped. And so there's that moral dimension, but there's also the practical dimension, which is that if you just let people suffer and don't do anything to stop it, it's going to get worse, it's not going to get better. Right. And then that could mean, for example, that I could lose all my stuff. Okay. Because there's a new class of people we talked about already, the middle class, the rise of the middle class. And this class is going to be really, you could kind of think about it as a managerial class, right? So as we industrialize, the corporations become less personal. They become kind of entities on their own that are made up of individuals. And the individuals that actually make those corporations work are the managers. Right. And so those people then will be the middle class. It will include the managerial class. It also will include, around this era, there were the formation of a lot of professional societies, like, for example, the American Medical association, the American Dental association, the American Historical association. Right? And these were what we would consider to be middle class interests forming their own interest groups. And this middle class is going to acquire property, right. It's not going to be a huge mansion on the cliffs in Rhode island, but it's going to be a little house in your neighborhood with a little lawn and a white picket fence and all that. Right? And so what that really means is that the middle class is now invested in the surplus that's being created by the industrial revolution and they want to keep it, right? And they are going to be afraid that if the social problems created by the industrial revolution aren't addressed, there's a real possibility they might lose all their stuff. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? So these are going to be the people then that are going to be pushing for reform and actually making reform happen. Okay? It actually comes from the middle. It doesn't come from the top, and it doesn't come from the bottle. Bottle. A lot of things come from the bottle, but not that, okay? It doesn't come from the bottom. It comes from the middle. We're going to talk about one other way of addressing social problems which you probably haven't heard of before, but if you think about it, you're really familiar with it, right? And that's positivism. Okay, so positivism is an idea that was thought up by this guy, August Komt. You may or may not have ever heard of him. He's the guy who theorized that you could consider society as a kind of a scientific environment, right? And that if you put people in society or you put countries in the society of nations, that those people could be managed scientifically. Right. His idea was that you could manage society scientifically into what we call modernization, which we talked about the other day, what that is, right. Industrialization and liberalism. But he was also the founder of the study of sociology. So if you ever had to take that class, this is the guy you're going to blame for it. Right? But at any rate, that idea that he had would be adopted. I'm going to give you a historical right, that idea that he had was adopted by. Right. Because in Mexico there was a great upheaval. Well, actually for a number of different years. But eventually what ended up happening was that the conflict situation in Mexico was resolved by the ascending to power of this handsome gentleman here, Pofidio Diaz, who was president of Mexico essentially for 40 years, okay? And the idea behind his idea, his strategy for rule, was that because Mexico was behind and was behind because of all the warfare that they'd fought. So it wasn't an industrialized, it wasn't a modernized country. And going with the formula that we talked about when we talked about on the first day, the formula was modernize or decolonized. Right. He and many other people in the world are working to try to modernize their society so that it doesn't become colonized. Right. And Mexico was under threat of colonization, at least on an economic level, which we'll talk about next, right. By the United States and by Britain and by France, Germany, right. All these different countries that are industrializing, that they see Mexico as ripe for exploitation because they have lots of resources and they're not modernized. You follow what I'm saying? So then the strategy was, well, we have to modernize society in order to be able to keep from being colonized. But we also know that industrialization leads to a lot of social upheaval. So what we're going to do is rather than just start to industrialize, we're going to manage that industrialization by scientists. And so when Pofrio Diaz comes to power in the 1880s, 1876, I think. But anyway, the point here is that the group of people that he appoints to run the nation and to modernize the nation are called scientificos, scientists, right? So the idea then is that they're going to apply these scientific principles to mexican society and economy in order to bring Mexico into modernization so that they will be among the industrial powers rather than among the colonized powers. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay. Well, that actually didn't really work out for a number of different reasons. And we'll talk some a little bit later. But these ideas are going to be popular in many other places, including the United States, right? The United States will, the progressives will look at the idea of positivism and say, well, this actually makes sense, right? That we should, rather than having everything run by money and power, we should actually scientifically control society so that we can overcome these social problems, right? So the idea then is society can be scientifically managed to modernization. And Americans, some Americans, progressives will start to believe this, but there's a problem with it in the United States. And what is that? What's the problem with the idea that scientists should be running the country? How do you become a scientist? Can you be elected scientist? No. You go to school. Yeah. You have to be educated. Right? Okay. So then means then, if only the people that can be rulers are scientists, what does that tell us about the government? Is it a democratic government? No. Think about like, for example, in, let's say, San Diego. At San Diego at one point they had a mayor and a city council and they were all elected, right? And then all the departments were run by people that were put in place by the elected people, right? You guys get what I'm saying? And they were patronage jobs, meaning that they could change at any time and they didn't even have to have any experience. Right. So you could be chief of police and not even have ever known anything about police. Right. Or you might want to use the police to support your drug running operation or something like that. Right. So in California, this group of progressives, and it's not just here, but I mean, in many places as well, at the same time they're going to say, okay, well, instead of having that, what we're going to do is we'll have an elected mayor and a city council. But all of the departments will be run by people who are scientists. Right? Okay. So that means essentially that the police chief has to be somebody who's trained to be a police chief, not just a good friend of the mayor. Right. You follow what I'm saying here? Well, here's why that's a problem. And I'm not saying it's a problem. It works really well. Okay. But the problem from american point of view is that once that police chief has been put in power, you can't remove him. Right. He wasn't elected and he can't be voted out of office. So what does that tell us about the government? Is it a democratic government? No. But what is the foundation for America's sense of itself? What kind of a government do we have? Democracy. A democracy in theory, right. So that's why when Americans look at positivism, when they look at, like, for example, what happened in Mexico, they'll notice that positivism is inherently anti democratic, right. Because you can't be elected scientists. Okay, so then what happens is that American will take these ideas of positivism and they will essentially change the name and kind of change the theme a little bit and call it progressivism. Now the difference between positivism and progressivism is kind of twofold because in most places, like in Mexico, positivism wasn't something that the people chose. It was chosen by the leaders. Right? But in America, progressive reforms are enacted at the ballot box. All right, so the reforms that we see that came about in the last part of the 19th and early part of the 20th century, for example, in California, where they decided they were no longer going to have the old machine politics of the mayor and the city council, but they were going to actually enact, they were going to actually put in place civil service reforms. That was something that was voted on by the people. The people actually made that happen. Right. So it is democratic in a way, but then once those reforms are enacted, that's when it becomes not democratic. Right. Because once the police chief is the police chief. You can't get rid of him unless he does something wrong. You know what I'm saying? Questions, comments? You can't just get rid of him because you don't like him. Right. Okay. So at any rate, when we look at the reform era in the United States, the reforms are going to be more based on this last idea and not on the first idea. Right. Really, both of the first ideas are rejected by Americans because Americans are concerned about being able to keep their property. Okay. Basically, that's it. Right. But positivism, what it does is it allows people to maintain their property and enhances their ability to keep it because of the fact that it does do away with social upheaval. And we'll talk about that in a second.
