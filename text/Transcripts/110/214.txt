Let's think about the issues and let's think about the parties and think about who's in favor of what. Okay, I'm going to go up instead of down. And the reason why. You'll see why in a minute. Right. But, so the tariff. What's the purpose of the tariff again? Protective. Protective tariffs. Who benefits from it? The industry. Like the industrial. Industrial interest. Right. Okay. So. So who's going to be in favor of higher tariffs? Republicans or Democrats? Republicans. Republicans, exactly. Democrats are going to be against it because they're farmers. Right. Or they represent the farmers. Okay. Money. The money issue. The hard money, the gold standard. Who does the gold standard actually help? Hard money. It would be like the banks or whoever issued the money, they would favor them the most. Right. The hard money represents commercial interests and industrial interests. Right. And which party would be in favor, then, of hard money? The gold standard? The Republican. Republican Party. Exactly. Okay. And then Democrats would be against it. Now, what about the patronage issue? Who does that actually help, Democrats or Republicans? What do you mean? Both? Yeah, it's both. Right. See, that's the thing. The patronage. This is why I saved it for last. Because the patronage actually helps both parties. Right. Because both parties can make deals for political favors. Right. So what's going to happen is that patronage or civil service reform will not be an issue either of the Republican or the democratic parties. It will be a progressive issue. The progressives are going to be the ones who are going to fight for civil service reform. And then eventually what that will do is it will take power out of the hands of the old bosses, whether they're at top or closer to the bottom. So it's actually not a republican Democrat issue. It's actually an issue of progressivism or traditionalism, I guess you could say. All right, I played the song about the wizard of Oz at the beginning of the course, at the beginning of the class. Here's the reason why. It actually is a good song. I kind of like it. Right. But the wizard of Oz has been considered kind of a metaphor for this era in american politics that we're talking about. Right. So. So it's the. Again, the gilded age is an age of rapid economic growth, a shift from agriculture to industry, and massive income inequality, which leads to a lot of social unrest. And so the story of the wizard of Oz, the characters in the wizard of Oz is going to encapsulate those issues in american politics. Now, whether or not the author actually intended that is, we don't really know that, but what we do know is that we can make a good connection between the wizard of Oz and the Gilded Age or the progressive era. Right? So if we look in at the characters, the scarecrow is going to represent the farmers. The Tin man is going to represent industrial workers. The cowardly lion is William Jennings Bryan. I'm sure you guys have read about him in your textbook. And he's also going to be. We're going to see him again in the class in a couple of weeks. Right? Dorothy is going to represent the populist party. Talk more about why in just a second. And then the wicked witches are going to be industrialist. The wicked witch of the east is eastern industrialist, and the Wicked Witch of the west is railroads. Then the emerald city is Washington, DC, for obvious reasons. Right, because it's green. And the wizard will be President McKinley. All right. Okay. So then the big question that we're left with is, well, who does Toto represent? I want to leave this part behind and we'll talk more about this. But continuing our story about the period of time that we're living in, this movement towards industrialization is going to have a catastrophic effect on farming in America. Okay? And here's the reason why. Because farming is going to become more industrialized, meaning that corporations are going to be able to grow food that makes it possible for the prices to fall. Okay? And so what will happen to the individual farmer will be that he goes at the beginning of the season and borrows money, and he grows these crops, and at the end of the season, he tries to sell his crops to the railroad to take to market, and he can't get as much money as he actually borrowed because the prices have fallen. So he goes into debt, and the next year he borrows more money and he actually buys more seed and he produces more crops with the idea that, well, if I didn't make any money last year, I'm going to need to make this much stuff to make it money. So he'll take his crops to market, but because there's more of them, the prices are going to be falling and he'll go deeper in debt. Right? So every year he grows more and more food, and every year he goes deeper and deeper in debt until he finally will end up in bankruptcy. Right? The problem of the farmer really is driven by industrialization. And the response of the farmer is really going to be to try to stop industrialization, but that's not going to happen. The United States is an industrial country, and so family farming in the United States essentially will disappear. Okay? Now, that's not to say that there aren't any family farmers, but that individual farmers have been replaced by industrial farming. I mean, go out to the Imperial Valley and look what's going on out there. It's all big business. It's not single family farmers. It's all big business. Right? Okay. So essentially, even agriculture has become industrialized in the United States, and the family farmer will really disappear. Okay, but he's right, in a way to think that the problem is in the industrial revolution. But that's not where he focuses his efforts. Where he focuses his efforts is going to be on the railroad, because he's going to see that every year he's going to make more and more stuff, and every year the railroad is going to change and charge more and more. Right. And he's going to think that the railroad is basically screwing him and that if he could regulate the railroad, then they would be able to make money. All right? The problem with that is that a railroad is an interstate entity. Right? Railroad doesn't just go from someplace in California to someplace in California. It goes from California to Chicago. Right. So what would happen if we were able to get the state government in California to regulate the railroad, which they were able to do? Actually, Illinois was the first. Right. But what that would mean would be that state law would say that railroads can only charge so much to move goods in California. But what about when they got to Nevada? Right. Well, that would be under Nevada law. You follow me here? All right? And they can't control that. So the railroads could say, okay, well, we're going to charge you a dime to get it from Sacramento to the border, and then $1,000 to get it into Nevada. You see what I'm saying? So regulating at the state level isn't going to help them. And what they end up doing then is they form a national party. And the national party, essentially, in the beginning, is an anti industrial party, but it will become eventually a reform party. Okay? And the Reform party is going to be called the Progressive Party. It starts off as the populist party, and it is essentially the party of the farmers. Right. And these are going to be their platform, their issues. All right? And I'm going to go out of order again. Right. The first thing I want to talk about is the silver gold ratio. And this is going to be an answer to the money problem. Right? Okay. So what was the problem with money again? What was the two types of money? It was gold and greenbacks. Right? Right. The gold standard and greenbacks. Right. What was the problem? If we were actually on the greenbacks, and some people wanted to go to the gold standard. Why did they want to go to the gold standard? To make profit. Right. Because that puts them in competition with the British. Right. But what we saw happening was that if you went from a situation where the money was essentially floating, the amount of currency on the market was essentially floating to a situation where the money was actually tied to specie, which is gold. What's going to happen to the amount of money in the economy? The amount of currency that's actually in the economy is what goes down. It's smaller. Right. Yeah. Okay. One of the ideas that people will have is, well, what if we had more species, right. They can't buy more gold because there really isn't any more gold. Right. Most of the gold is already owned. So what they do is they suggest that we should buy silver at the rate of 16oz of silver is going to be equal to 1oz of gold. This is going to be called bimetalism. Right. And the idea would be then, if we put silver into the treasury along with the gold, there can be more what? More currency. More currency. Right. Which theoretically will solve the problem of, or at least one of the problems of going back on the gold standard. You follow what I'm saying? And this eventually will happen, that they will buy. The United States will buy up a lot of silver. Right. But I wanted to go. This one first was because we were just talking about the wizard of Oz, right? And you guys know that in the wizard of Oz, Dorothy had a special pair of shoes. What were they made of? Slippers. Rubies. I'm sorry. Rubies. Right. Ruby slippers. Exactly. All right. But in the book, the slippers were silver. Right. So let's think about this for a second. You have silver slippers and you have. What kind of a road was she on? Yellow. Yellow bricks. What do you think a yellow brick is? Gold. Right. So you see bimetalism there. Okay, he's got it. Anyway, so that's going to be one of the policies. The next one will be popular election of Us senators. In the original constitution, senators were actually appointed by the states, not elected by the people. Actually, the states were left up to choose however they wanted. Right. But the result was that the Senate was full of people with money and influence. The Senate was called a millionaires club. By the time we get to the end of the 19th century, and the progressives, the populace and then the progressives are going to say, well, we need to get those guys out of there. Because they're just protecting their own interests, right? They're not protecting the interests of the people. So then they're going to propose that the senators should be elected by the people rather than appointed by the states. All right? And then I'm going to go out of order again here. I'm going to talk about public ownership of railroads. Okay, so now, the idea of public ownership of railroads is that the government would essentially buy the railroads from the railroad companies and operate them themselves. Right. Meaning that because the government is made up of the will of the. Right, that would mean that the people own the railroads. And so rather than have the railroads owned by private corporations, they'll be owned by everybody. All right. Now, there's a huge problem with that in the United States. What do you think that is? Basically what they're saying is we're not going to allow private ownership. Instead, the government's going to own everything. Or that means that everybody owns everything in common. What does that mean? It's socialism. Socialism, communism. The idea that private property is taken away. Okay, so socialism and communism are always going to be rejected by Americans. Americans don't like communism or socialism because the idea behind communism and socialism is that everybody shares everything in common. And that looks like a good idea. That's one of the reasons why communism actually came about in the 1840s and why it was so popular in many places in the world was because it left lots of people without anything. Right. And if the only time that actually sharing everything seems like a good idea is when you don't have anything. So, for example, if you have a car and I don't have a car, I think it would be great if you lent me your car. But if I have a car and you don't have a car, I think you should get your own car. You follow how that works? You would think then, because there are so many poor people in America because of the industrial revolution, that they would be in favor of socialism, but they're not. And the reason why is because Americans always believe that they could be rich, right? There was a canadian scholar who explained that Americans socialism never became popular in America because America doesn't have any poor people. It only has temporarily displaced millionaires. And what that means is I might be poor now, but I might be rich later, and I don't want to give up my chance of owning things later. So I'm not going to be in favor of socialism. So essentially, the reason why Americans don't like socialism is because they like stuff. Everybody has stuff. Everybody wants more stuff. And they don't want to share it. So anyway, that's going to be the argument against public ownership of railroads, and that will never happen in the United States. The other one is similar to that graduated income tax. What that means is that the people who make more money pay a higher rate of taxes than the people who make less money. And some people don't pay any money. Right. Some people don't pay any tax because they don't make enough money to pay taxes. Right. So let's say now that I'm an adjunct professor and I don't make enough money to pay taxes, but then you compare me to somebody like Bezos, right, who makes tens of thousands of dollars an hour, and the idea behind a graduated income tax is because Jeff Bezos has so much more money, he should pay more, and because I don't have any money, I should pay less. Does that seem like a good idea? That's how they were able to balance out at the time. Right. That's what they did to balance it out. Like they made the richer pay more in taxes and the poor pay less in taxes. Well, that's the way it is now. We do have a graduated income tax, but many people are against it. Why would people be against it? Because it takes away from. Go ahead. It could discourage people from wanting to work harder in the future because that's true. But most people, I mean, even people who I know who are staunch capitalists, will say it's better to make money and pay taxes than. Right. But that's not really the issue here. The issue is we have to think about what are the taxes used for? In theory, public works. Public works, right. So taxes. The government raises taxes with our consent in order to provide services that are good for the people. That's the. Okay, so now what that means then, is that Jeff Bezos is paying $1,000 in taxes. I'm just making these numbers up. Right. And I'm not paying any. Right. But I get the same benefit as Jeff Bezos. Right. And so that means that Jeff Bezos. I'm actually benefiting from Jeff Bezos money. You see what I'm saying? And so Jeff Bezos is going to say, well, why should I pay for services for Dr. Cox? Let him pay for his own services. You follow what I'm saying here? So again, it's a matter of income distribution. It's a matter of. Or redistribution is better to say it. Okay. That we take money from those who have and give it to those who don't have. Right. But doesn't that sound like communism? From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. Right? And do Americans like communism? And why not? Because we think we're going to be rich because we like stuff. Right? We like stuff. I have stuff. I want stuff and I don't want to share it with anybody else. Now let me just mention to you, as I already said, that we have a graduated income tax in the United States. And let's think about the issue of socialism again. We'll bring this up again more later in the course, right? But if we think about the issue of socialism, Americans tend to think of free market, les faire versus socialism share everything, right? And there's a hard line between them. But in reality, there really is no such thing as a free market or Les fair. The government always has its hands on the economy, right? And the way that they do that and one way that they do that is by raising taxes, right? We all pay taxes. I mean, even if you don't pay income tax, you pay tax at the 711. So we all pay taxes. And so what we see then is that there is a kind of an element of socialism built into the system that claims to be capitalist, right? For example, let's say that we all pay taxes, but I pay much less taxes than so and so does. And yet the taxes are used to build a road and I get to use the road just like the other guy. Right? So I'm getting benefit for something that I didn't pay for, essentially, and that's income redistribution. Or we could talk about the military. The military doesn't just defend the people that pay the most taxes sends everybody. Right? And the fire department and all these different things, right? So there is an element then that could be labeled socialism and that a lot of people will label socialism. You listen to a hardline economic republican, they would say, well, we don't want to have the government do anything. Let's privatize everything and not have the government do anything, right? But most of those people are well outside the mainstream because everybody wants the services, everybody wants the roads, everybody wants to be safe from invasion and things like that, right? So we allow that even in a capitalist system. So even though we live in a capitalist system, there is an element of socialism. And the argument never really is should we have socialism or not? Or should we have government control of the economy or not? The question is how much control should there be, right? Should the government have very little control like the Republicans would want, or should the government have much more control like many of the Democrats would want. And that's what we argue about. That's the kind of the center of the focus of american politics. It's not over whether or not the United States government should be involved, but how much should it be involved? So when people will point to, well, like I said, the idea of, let's say, for example, welfare, people will look at welfare and say, okay, well, this person is not working and I'm paying for them to have food and shelter, right? So that's taking money from me to support them. That's not fair. Okay? But then at the same time, we see the government taking less money from corporations and supporting itself with money from who don't make as much, right? Like, for example, certain industries don't pay any tax at all, but they still get the benefit of american law. So isn't that socialism, too? So there's this idea of everything that I don't like is socialist is really just smoke. It's not real. Okay. It's not the reality of american politics.
