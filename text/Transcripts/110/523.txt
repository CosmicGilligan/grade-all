US2: 523
You guys remember when we talked about the Versailles treaty and the United States rejected the Versailles treaty? Does anybody remember why? Because Congress, it took away Congress's power to start a war, and they could just go, war. Okay, so the United States never joined the League of Nations, right? But after World War two, the United States actually did create a new organization called the United nations, and it was based on the same idea as Wilson's idea of collective security. And the idea, then again, was that if it's collective security, that means everybody's on the same side. And if one country attacks another country, it's the same as attacking everybody. And that's to prevent. Prevent a small country from trying to attack another country, because then they'll be at war with everybody. That's the idea. Right? Okay, so what happens is that, well, let's just take a look here. This is Korea. Korea had been dominated by the Japanese since the beginning of the 20th century. And after world War two, Korea becomes independent, but it ends up being divided between the Soviets and the Americans, okay? And so the result was, instead of creating one Korea, after World War two, there were actually two Koreas, okay? And one of them established a soviet style communist regime, and the other one established an american style capitalist regime. And that's really the same way as it is now. Okay, but what happened was that the North Koreans, actually, the Soviets and the North Koreans thought that it would be possible for them to overrun the korean peninsula and just establish one Korea as a communist country. So now this is an example of soviet expansionism, right? That the Soviets want to expand communism. And the way that they're going to do it is by force in this particular case. Right? So the Soviets invade, or actually, the North Koreans invade South Korea, and the south korean military is pushed all the way back to this little tiny area right here. Right? But what happens is that because South Korea is in the United Nations, President Truman goes to the United nations and asks the United nations to declare war. And they do, right? And then Truman goes to Congress and says, hey, we're at war. We need money, right? Okay, so that sounds a lot like what the Republicans were afraid of when they talked about the League of Nations, doesn't it? Because the United States didn't declare war. It was actually the United nations that declared war, and the United States was dragged into it by this treaty obligation. You guys are with me. Okay, well, anyway, so that turned out to be true. But at any rate, what happens is that the United States does then go to war in Korea, and the commander of the US forces in the Pacific, Douglas MacArthur, who was a great hero of the war, many people thought of him as. As one of the two major generals of the war. He was Yemen. Eisenhower. Right. And MacArthur created, engineered a strategy of a massive amphibious landing here at Incheon, which cut the lines of the North Koreans, and they were forced to withdraw. And so then the question is that once the North Koreans had recrossed the line, MacArthur said, well, we should go ahead and just take over Korea, and then we won't have this threat of communism to worry about anymore. The kind of thing that would have caused some caution was that the Chinese had threatened that if the United States invaded North Korea, then the Chinese would oppose that invasion. But the Americans were not too concerned about the Chinese, because the Chinese had been fighting a civil war that had just ended. And so they were weak, essentially. They thought they had more manpower than they knew what to do with, but they were essentially militarily weak. So the Americans were not that concerned about China. And they did eventually convince Truman that, to go ahead and invade North Korea. And they did actually take almost all of North Korea. You can see this purple line here. But at that point, then the Chinese did invade, and they again pushed the Americans and their allies back. And eventually what ended up happening was that they negotiated an armistice. One of the things that happened as part of this incident was that when the Chinese invaded North Korea, MacArthur and his generals proposed to Truman that they should just drop nuclear bombs on China. But Truman, by now, or actually by now, the Soviet Union had their own nuclear weapons. And Truman realized that it was no longer possible to, to fight a total war. You could no longer use whatever means you had at your disposal, because if you started a nuclear war, the outcome would be the destruction of everything or could be. Right. And so Truman basically said, no, you can't use nuclear weapons. And in response to that, MacArthur, who's general of the army, is going to publicly criticize Truman. Okay, what would be the problem with the general of the army publicly criticizing the president? Isn't the president supposed to be the commander in chief of the army? That's exactly right. The president. So he was publicly criticizing his boss. Right. And what was his boss's response? We fired him. He fired MacArthur. Right. And. But that caused a lot of damage. It caused a lot of unrest in the United States because people loved MacArthur and they couldn't care less about Truman. Right. But Truman actually ended up firing MacArthur, which probably didn't help his political career, but at the same time, it demonstrated that the era of total war was over, the United States could no longer engage in, or really, nobody could engage in total war any longer because of the existence of nuclear weapons. You guys are with me. And so MacArthur complained about it, and he gave a famous speech at West Point that old soldiers never die, they just fade away. But then he did die. So I guess he was wrong about that, too. All right. So anyway, questions, comments about that? I have a question about the armistice line. Is that where the line was before the war began? Actually, the line is the 38th parallel. Okay. That was the line before the war began, but this is where it ended up, basically, almost where it was to begin with.
