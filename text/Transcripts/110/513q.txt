1. Recall from lecture 2.1.1 "The Limits of National Government" the role of the national government in the Federal system. We have seen how that role increased in size and effect during World War I and the New Deal. Describe how Americans' perception of the role of the national government in domestic affairs changed during World War II.
2. Why do Americans accept this change?
3. Given our discussion of the criticisms against the New Deal in module 4, what groups do you think continue to oppose the expanded reach of the national government today and why?
