So I want to spend a little bit of time now talking about some definitions, and that's kind of the thing that we've been aiming at today, and some of these I've already talked about. So, historiography, the study of historical writing, or how do we. History of how we tell the story over time, which I. Which we saw today. We saw Frederick Jackson Turner tell the story one way, and we saw Patricia Lemmy tell it a different way. Okay. Ontology, an implicit organization of the world and its inhabitants. What does that mean? It's implied. Everybody knows it, but it's not stated. It doesn't have to be stated. Okay. Everybody just knows that. And that's something we'll have to actually wrestle with more as we go through the course because it really only makes sense to understand what people are doing if we understand their point of view. Okay, then here's a couple of terms that you're probably not familiar with, and these aren't really kind of common terms, but they're terms I found in a book that I like a lot, and it describes the challenge for historians, because we'll say, okay, there's historicity one and historicity two. Historicity one is what happened, and historicity two is what is said to have happened. Right. Obviously, they're not the same thing. What happened is what happened. But what is said to have happened is influenced by, for example, just not long ago, there was a Super bowl, and the Super bowl was between Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Kansas City Chiefs. And the Buccaneers won the Super bowl, and the score was 31 to nine. I think something like that. I don't really watch football, but I know this happened. Okay? Now, if I'm a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan and you ask me about that game, I would say, well, that was a great game. I love that game because our guy, Tom Brady won another ring, and Tampa Bay has now won the Super bowl. And it's just a very positive experience for me. But if you ask somebody who's a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs, they'll say, that was a horrible game. I mean, it was awful. It just was. Can't. It's almost hard to take. I almost want to cry or something like that. Right? And you can see what we've just done is that we've taken the same historicity one and we've created two very different narratives. Right. And what drives that narrative? What drives the narrative is our own ontological point of view. Am I a Chiefs fan or am I a Buccaneers fan? You follow what I'm saying? So this is something we have to think about whenever we're considering what happened in the past, because we're going to look know secondary sources. I'll tell you what that is in a right. People who have interpreted what happened, like Frederick Jackson Turner interpreted what happened, or Patricia Limerick interpreted what happened, and they interpret it from their own ontological point of view. And on top of that, we have our own ontological point of view. So we might now think that Frederick Jackson Turner is full of beans and that Patricia Limerick is closer to the mark. That's our own ontological point of view, and we have to be able to recognize that as well. Okay, so that's historicity one, historicity two. The challenge of how you weigh what happened against what is said to have happened. All right? And then finally, sources that historians use, generally texts, but can also be photographs and media, things like that. Right? But a primary source is an uninterpreted document, and a secondary source is an interpretation of a primary source. So in this case, we could say that primary source is declaration of Independence. The secondary source is my book, telling you what the Declaration of Independence means. So the primary source is not interpreted, it just is what it is, and the secondary source is an interpretation of that document. We could also look, for example, at the two works we looked at today, Turner's thesis, which we could now, because it's well over 100 years old, consider to be a primary source, and Patricia Limerick, who is interpreting that document. Okay, so we could say, okay, the Turner thesis is a primary source, and the Limerick Book is an interpretation of that source. So Turner's thesis is a primary source, and Patricia Limerick's thesis, or Patricia Limerick's book is a secondary source in interpretation of Turner's primary source. And so that's the lecture, I guess you could say, for today. This is Professor Cox signing off. Live long and prosper.
