  <p>1. Hitler was able to unify the German people by creating a false sense of racial unity and preying on historic antisemitic fears in the midst of an economic crisis. Anti-semitism has deep, persistent roots in European culture dating back centuries. After Kaiser abdicated the throne Germany was Republic with many Jewish members in key positions within the government. This fueled a harmful idea in Germany that Jews in exchange for power had sold out their country and surrendered when Germany could have won in. Hitler weaponized and amplified existing antisemitic prejudice to gain power. Germany claimed the superiority of the German master race promoting a fictional Aryan ideal with no historical basis. He exploited the majority white European identity to create a false sense of racial unity which empowered struggling citizens.&nbsp;The reparations and Great Depression led to immense suffering after the Great War. Suffering Germans were receptive to Hitler's prejudice because by eliminating what he identified as "the enemy" he promised to fix the economy. He was really just consolidating power for his personal agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. No American's are not immune to this type of appeal. The anti-semitism that is so rooted in European culture has a history here in the United States as well. Often fueled by Eastern European migrations over the years, the US harbors its own antisemitic sentiments. The prejudice unjustly framed Jewish people as foreigners and responsible for killing Jesus. You can see this demonstrated during Hitler's reign when a ship of Jewish refugees fleeing Germany were denied entry into the United States and the refugees were forced back to Germany where they were forced into concentration camps. The kind of racism that Hitler weaponized was not unique to Germany and is still prevalent in varying forms around the world today including the United Sates.&nbsp;</p>
