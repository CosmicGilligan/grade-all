JOSHUA IBARRA,"1. Historically, jews have been persecuted against throughout history and especially in Germany following WWI; Hitler capitalized on the growing hostile sentiment against Jews in Germany as many prominent positions of political power were held by Jews at that time which Hitler then made them out to be scapegoats through his book Mein Kampf by blaming all of Germany's political and economic issues on them, and that it was their fault Germany had lost the War and is in the its dire situation because of that. By otherizing a group of people that the German population already had misgivings against, Hitler was able to secure power in Germany by promising prosperity for the country and to get rid of what was making things bad for the Germans (the Jews in this case) if they only elect him to power. He would then bolster his movement by giving them a central identity that many Germans could rally behind with the Aryan race, which would create the unity and solidarity that Hitler needed to make his force and movement as powerful as it was due to the intense emotional support that people had for him and his ideas because they saw themselves within his vision. 2. No, Americans are not immune to this sensational and extremist form of racial agitation propaganda. Throughout our history we've been swayed by bad faith actors and their words in order to do abhorrent things under the guise of gaining power or economic leverage. One such recent instance was the storming of the capital following the 2020 election, radical media personalities like Alex Jones were able to galvanize a subset of the population to go to the capital in DC and try to stop the election from being certified all because Trump lost and he couldn't admit to losing so he called the election rigged against him even though he was the one already in power. Such rhetoric is harmful because as we saw there are people who believe it and will then do things they normally would not do in the name of what they believe to be freedom and justice and what their ""leader"" who radicalized them would want.","1. Grade: 85  Your response effectively outlines how Hitler exploited pre-existing anti-Semitic sentiments and used scapegoating alongside the promise of rejuvenating Germany to consolidate power and promote unity through the notion of racial superiority. Your explanation of the Aryan race concept as a unifying identity aligns well with lecture content, highlighting Hitler's manipulative tactics. However, it would enhance your answer to mention Hitler's broader implications of racial hierarchy and the specific ways he disseminated his ideologies through Mein Kampf and public discourse to foment widespread support.  Supportive Feedback: Great job connecting historical antisemitism with Hitler's strategies to unify and mobilize Germany through racial theories. Be sure to further detail the mechanisms of propaganda and communication Hitler used to spread his message.  2. Grade: 75  You've correctly identified that Americans are not immune to the types of appeals based on sensationalism and extremist propaganda that can lead to division and violence. Your comparison to recent events shows an understanding of how powerful rhetoric and manipulation can incite action among a population. However, the response could be strengthened by drawing more direct parallels to the lecture's caution regarding politicians who weaponize racial division for political gain. While your example of the Capitol storming is relevant, incorporating discussion on how this reflects similar tactics to those used by Hitler (minus comparing individuals directly) or discussing the broad pattern of using scapegoats in political rhetoric in the U.S. context would make your argument more comprehensive.  Supportive Feedback: You've made a relevant connection between the susceptibility of societies, including the United States, to extremist rhetoric and actions. In the future, try to more directly link these observations back to historical contexts and examples from the lecture for deeper analysis.

Joseph Forte,1. Hitler villainized the Jewish people and convinced Germany that they were the reason for the loss of WW1. He made them believe that he was the only one who could save them from this evil he created in their head. 2. No we are not immune to this appeal. We may be resistant to it because we have seen it happen but we are not invulnerable to it happening.,"1. Grade: 85 Your response aptly summarizes how Hitler villainized Jewish people and positioned himself as the savior against this constructed enemy, which is a good overview. However, it lacks details about his racial theory hierarchy and how it specifically aimed to unify the German people under the notion of Aryan superiority. Including how he weaponized historic antisemitism could have enriched your answer.  2. Grade: 80 Your answer correctly states that Americans are not immune to such appeals, which aligns with the lecture's discussion on the universality of racial prejudice and its potential for weaponization by politicians. However, expanding on how such vulnerabilities exist in American society and drawing parallels to the lecture's examples of historical or contemporary instances could have provided a more comprehensive answer.  Overall, your responses capture the essence of how Hitler used racial theories and historic antisemitism for unification towards a war of conquest, and correctly recognize the potential vulnerability of American society to similar appeals. To strengthen your future answers, consider incorporating more specific examples and explanations that directly tie back to the lecture material.

Cory Miller,"1. He used Germans suffering by giving them a scapegoat for blame, on the jews and neighboring countries as not worthy of the land and resources. Antisemitism had been there in Europe for a very long time Hitler managed to turn it into a weapon. 2.  As Americans we absolutely aren't immune antisemitism has been very prominent in our country for a very long time. Christianity and Catholicism are the major religions in this country and believe the jews killed Jesus.","1. Grade: 80 Comments: Your response accurately identifies key aspects of how Hitler unified the German people through the use of racial theory and historic antisemitism, including the scapegoating of Jews and the devaluation of neighboring countries. However, you could have elaborated more on how Hitler's specific racial hierarchy placed Germans at the top and further explained the concept of living space (Lebensraum) as a justification for conquest. Additionally, addressing Hitler's manipulation of existing antisemitic sentiments to weaponize them for his political benefits would have strengthened your answer.   2. Grade: 70 Comments: You effectively recognize that Americans are not immune to the type of appeal that Hitler utilized, acknowledging the presence of antisemitism in the United States. However, your response could benefit from a more detailed analysis, such as mentioning more contemporary examples or trends that signify this lack of immunity beyond the historical religious context. Incorporating a discussion about how certain ideologies or prejudices are formed or perpetuated in American society today would provide a more complete answer to the question.  Overall Feedback: You have a strong foundational understanding of how Hitler used racial theories and historic antisemitism for unification and war. You also made an important observation about the susceptibility of Americans to similar appeals. To enhance your responses, aim to provide more specific examples and broaden your analysis to include the manipulation of these sentiments in a wider societal and historical context. Keep exploring these complex topics with curiosity and depth.

Gabrielle Llanes,"1. Hitler was able to unify the German people by creating a false sense of racial unity and preying on historic antisemitic fears in the midst of an economic crisis. Anti-semitism has deep, persistent roots in European culture dating back centuries. After Kaiser abdicated the throne Germany was Republic with many Jewish members in key positions within the government. This fueled a harmful idea in Germany that Jews in exchange for power had sold out their country and surrendered when Germany could have won in. Hitler weaponized and amplified existing antisemitic prejudice to gain power. Germany claimed the superiority of the German master race promoting a fictional Aryan ideal with no historical basis. He exploited the majority white European identity to create a false sense of racial unity which empowered struggling citizens. The reparations and Great Depression led to immense suffering after the Great War. Suffering Germans were receptive to Hitler's prejudice because by eliminating what he identified as ""the enemy"" he promised to fix the economy. He was really just consolidating power for his personal agenda. 2. No American's are not immune to this type of appeal. The anti-semitism that is so rooted in European culture has a history here in the United States as well. Often fueled by Eastern European migrations over the years, the US harbors its own antisemitic sentiments. The prejudice unjustly framed Jewish people as foreigners and responsible for killing Jesus. You can see this demonstrated during Hitler's reign when a ship of Jewish refugees fleeing Germany were denied entry into the United States and the refugees were forced back to Germany where they were forced into concentration camps. The kind of racism that Hitler weaponized was not unique to Germany and is still prevalent in varying forms around the world today including the United Sates.","1. Grade: 95  Your response accurately outlines how Hitler used racial theories and historic antisemitism to unify Germany and prepare for war. You've correctly noted the exploitation of economic hardship and antisemitic prejudices, alongside the fabrication of a ""German master race,"" to consolidate power. However, the slight overemphasis on the Republic being mainly managed by Jewish officials could be nuanced, as this perception was more a Nazi propaganda tool than historical reality. Excellent connection to the broader European context of antisemitism.   2. Grade: 90  You provide a thoughtful examination of why Americans are not immune to such appeals, drawing parallels between European antisemitism and its presence in the United States. The example of the Jewish refugees being turned away is poignant; however, it might also be beneficial to explicitly relate current events or sentiments that showcase similar patterns of behavior or belief systems in the US today. This would strengthen your argument about the continued relevance and risk of such prejudices.  Overall feedback for the student: Your submission is thorough and shows a deep understanding of the material, particularly how Hitler utilized racial theories and antisemitism to his advantage and the danger of believing any society is immune to similar tactics. You've done well to tie historic attitudes to modern implications, underscoring the importance of vigilance against such prejudices. Keep an eye on ensuring all aspects of your examples match up with historical facts for even greater accuracy in your future work.

Adeline Corbett,"1. He wrote a book that talked about how Jews had betrayed Germany and how Germans were superior. His worldview created a hierarchy with Germans at the pinnacle. Hitler first began by unifying all German speaking people into Greater Germany and then he would focus Eastward claiming that the people of eastern Europe were undeserving of their land. Those standing of the way of Hitler conquering all this land would not only be defeated but in fact terminated. People followed Hitlers ways because this gave Germans anxiety's a target, amidst their suffering. He harnessed and amplified existing prejudice to gain power. 2.

Grade: 85 Your summary accurately captures how Hitler used racial theory and historic anti-Semitism to unify the German people and justify his expansionist policies. You have effectively outlined the progression of his ideology, from the scapegoating of Jews to the concept of Lebensraum, showing a clear understanding of the lecture content. However, you could improve by providing more detail on how Hitler's ideas were specifically rooted in long-standing European anti-Semitism, which the lecture noted was not invented by Hitler but was weaponized by him. Additionally, mentioning Hitler's propagation of these ideas through ""Mein Kampf"" and his strategic use of existing prejudice for political gain would deepen your response.  2. Grade: 90 Your response reflects an awareness of the persistence of susceptibility to such appeals, even in American society, as demonstrated by the historical example you provided about the Jewish refugees. It shows a good understanding of the lecture's caution against underestimating the potential for racially or ethnically motivated political strategies to gain traction. To strengthen your answer, you could further explore contemporary examples or more directly address the broader argument the lecture made about the danger of scapegoating and othering in any society, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and critical thinking to resist such appeals.  Feedback: You've done a good job of relating Hitler's use of racial theories and historical anti-Semitism to his broader goals and illustrating how these ideas can still resonate in societies today, including America.

Owen Zhang,"Hitler was able to use the underlying historic antisemitism to united the German people against one common enemy. By making it so that the German people were the best and that the Jewish and Eastern European were useless, he convinced the suffering Germans to join a war of conquest. Americans in general are not completely immune to this type of appeal. It can be seen during the pandemic, where Asian-Americans were targeted for hate crimes and violence. This type of appeal can be seen often, against the Chinese or against the Mexicans, it is all the same. From a person to person basis, there are some that support these ideas and some who do not, but the fact that these ideas get the support that they do show that Americans are less immune to these appeals than they would hope.","80  Your response effectively captures how Hitler utilized racial theories and historic antisemitism to galvanize the German populace towards a war of conquest, emphasizing the delineation Hitler made between the so-called superior German race and others he deemed inferior. You also made a pertinent connection to recent events in America, illustrating the persistence of similar appeals to racism and xenophobia. However, your answer could benefit from a more detailed examination of Hitler's methods, particularly the role of propaganda and the societal context in Germany that made his message resonate.

Joseph Robichaud,"He gained political power through the weaponization of antisemitism. After WW1 and the Great Depression, Hitler exploited the suffering of many German's and used Jews as a scapegoat for this suffering. As he rose in power he was able to use this antisemitism to unite the German people into waging war with other European Nations he claimed the Jews had sold Germany out to. No, American's are not immune to this appeal. Sadly, with covid the republicans were able to point to the liberals mistakes as treasonous. As for the democratic tent, they have weaponized political ideology to aggressively oppose any form of conservative thought. With all of the infighting, it seems both sides have done nothing but strip Americans of rights and power. Both sides are now claiming that the other side is evil and only they can fix it. Personally, I believe we are on a very dangerous path to an authoritarian United States. However, that can change if new parties emerge as winners of elections and political ideas/agendas shift back in the favor of the Republic. We have undergone political shifts in the past and I only hope that is the outcome of our future political landscape. Change needs to happen, otherwise at the rate the US is going, to much power in the hands of one party for to long will be disastrous.","Grade: 80  Comments: Your response accurately identifies how Hitler used antisemitism and racial theories to gain and consolidate power by scapegoating Jews for Germany's suffering post-WW1 and the Great Depression. You correctly point out that Hitler's narrative unified Germans towards a war of conquest. However, your comparison between contemporary American politics and Nazi Germany's use of antisemitism to seize power needs further elaboration on specific parallels rather than just the observation of political division and accusations. While your concern over political polarization and the risk of authoritarianism is valid, drawing a direct analogy to the specific mechanics of Hitler's rise to power, as discussed in the lecture, would strengthen your argument. Additionally, while your analysis of American politics raises important issues, it veers slightly from the lecture's focus on historical antisemitism and racial theories.  Your insight on the dangers of political polarization and the need for a shift to preserve democratic values is commendable. Remember, drawing precise historical parallels requires careful consideration of the unique contexts and mechanisms at play.

Eric Rath,"The government that formed in Germany after the Kaiser abdicated was a republic, but with many Jewish members in key positions. This fueled a dangerous belief in Germany that Jews had sold out their country somehow by engineering a surrender, when Germany could have won WW II. This line of thinking was completely untrue, but that belief took hold and was intensified by Adolf Hitler’s twisted vision in his book ‘Mein Kampf’ (my struggle) and his false narrative about how the Jews had betrayed Germany. In addition, Hitler proclaimed the superiority of the German Master Race, and his racist worldview created a hierarchy with Germans at the top, followed by other Europeans with decreasing amounts of worthiness. Hitler’s plan was to conquer Eastward, unifying all German-speaking people into a greater Germany, the Third Reich, with the fictional Aryan ideal. Those who were not part of this elite group, the subhumans who were undeserving of their lands, would be over-run and exterminated. 2. Today we have similar scenario playing out in the United States. We have a malicious moron running for president of the United States of America who is manipulating people’s worst instincts and insecurities. He has weaponized existing prejudices and will continue to lie, abuse, accuse, and betray any American who does not agree with his pathological need to feel secure in power and avoid a life in prison. There are desperate, angry people in America looking at this particular individual as a savior for their pain and needs without knowledge of the Constitution, WWII History and the human wretchedness he will bring to this entire nation.","1. Grade: 90  Your response effectively captures how Hitler leveraged deeply ingrained antisemitism and the fabricated narrative of racial superiority to unify Germany under his vision for expanded conquest. However, the detail about the German government having many Jewish members in key positions, while touching on the widespread misconceptions of the time, slightly misses the nuance that the belief in Jewish betrayal was largely unfounded and propagated by such figures as Hitler, rather than a direct correlation to Jewish participation in the Weimar Republic's government. Your description of Hitler’s plans and the racial hierarchy he espoused correlates well with the lecture material, providing a solid answer to the question.  2. Your comparison of current political dynamics in the United States to the techniques used by Hitler is provocative and highlights the concern for recognizing and rejecting the weaponization of bigotry in political discourse. While drawing parallels between historical and contemporary political figures can be contentious, it's vital to remain informed and critical of the intentions and implications of political rhetoric and actions. Your response indicates a deep engagement with the subject matter, though it is essential to maintain a balanced and substantiated critique in academic discussions.

Chris Shelor,"5.1.2 War in Europe Describe how Hitler used racial theory and historic antisemitism to unify the German people into waging a war if conquest. Hitler exploited racial theory and historic antisemitism to obtain power and empower the German people for war. By Hitler creating the false narrative that the Jewish people had betrayed Germany and was engineering their defeat in World War I, Hitler ignited existing prejudices and scapegoated the Jews for Germany's economic and social hardships. Hitler propagated a racist worldview that portrayed  Germans as the superior race and Hitler called for the German people to unify under the banner of the Third Reich. This racial ideology justified Hitler's vision of expansion, including conquering Eastern Europe for Lebensraum, or living space, for the German people. As Americans are we immune to this type of appeal? Hitler's propaganda, and antisemitic views, were not unique to Germany; similar prejudices existed in the United States, just in different forms. While Germany's anti-Semitism was overt and widespread, there were U.S. citizens who also harbored anti-Semitic views, often fueled by previous groups of Eastern European immigration. Regardless of the difference's strategies for propaganda, the underlying appeal of scapegoating and manipulating a societies distress and mistrust to obtain power, transcends all borders. Hitler's ability to exploit existing prejudices underscores the dangers of authoritarianism and the importance of being prudent, against the manipulation of a person or a peoples, fear and hatred for political gain.","Grade: 85  Your response effectively outlines how Hitler leveraged racial theory and historic antisemitism to rally the German people behind his war of conquest and expansion.

Zabdiel Morales Ramirez,"1. Following Germany's catastrophic circumstances, a deadly misconception that the Jews had had sold out their country spread. This school of thought was advanced by Adolf Hitler in his book ""Mein Kampf,"" where he simultaneously proclaimed the supremacy of the German Master Race. Hitler used this long-standing antisemitism as a weapon and capitalized on it to seize control. Hitler used this scapegoating to his advantage, and the suffering of the German people made them susceptible to his manipulation and supplied a target for their fears. He constructed a hierarchy based on this racist mindset, placing Germans at the top and other Europeans below them in decreasing order of merit. Hitler created a false sense of racial solidarity in Germany by taking advantage of the shared white European identity of the people. People accepted his promotion of a mystical Aryan ideal because it gave them a sense of empowerment. 2. We as Americans are not immune to this type of appeal, as it has been historically seen. People who are in dire situations have a very natural tendency to attempt and assign blame or a target to their fears. The appeals Hitler weaponized persist in many forms across the globe, including the US, to this day.

Charles Rodriguez,"1.) Hitler used racial theory in order to blame the Jewish for their role in ""selling out"" Germany to be divided, as many Jewish people during the time were in high positions of power. Furthermore, Hitler promoted the superiority of a master ""Aryan"" race, and that Germans were at the top of the hierarchy of race, and anyone else was below them. Hitler also unified people to his cause by promoting anti-Semitism and authoritarianism to desperate Germans of the time. 2.) As Americas, we are not immune to these types of appeals, which is why education on how an authoritarian society looks like is important in order to avoid anti-Semitism and racism.

Caleb Gross,"1. Firstly, Hitler promoted the belief that the Jewish people in Germany were responsible for Germany losing World War 1 since there were many Jewish people that had been given key positions during the war. The belief also promotes the idea that Germany could have won the war, but the Jews somehow forced Germany to surrender to the West. During his rule, Hitler would also invent the false belief that Germans were the ""Master Race"", and that Jews, as well as Americans due to their diversity, were considered the lowest of peoples. Hitler fueling the European hatred for Jewish people would allow him to rally up more supporters for him and his war against the West. 2. Americans are not immune to these types of appeal.

However, you could enhance your response by discussing how Hitler's racial hierarchy placed various ethnicities and races, emphasizing the use of Mein Kampf to spread his ideology and the broader socio-economic context in Germany that made such narratives appealing.  2. Grade: 90 You've provided relevant contemporary examples showing that Americans are not immune to similar appeals based on prejudice and misinformation. It would have been helpful to draw a more explicit connection to the lecture content by mentioning the historical context of antisemitism and racism in the U.S., as discussed in the lecture, to further illustrate your point.  Great job outlining how racial ideologies and prejudices can be manipulated in society, both historically and presently. Reflecting on these aspects helps us understand the dangers of divisive narratives and the importance of resisting them.

Olumayowa Oduntan,"1. Hitler spoke the narrative that Jews had betrayed Germany and also spread the idea that Germans were at the top of the racial hierarchy. This antisemitism spread by Hitler caused the Germans to unite together. 2. We, as Americans, are not immune to this appeal. Once the leaders of the nation determine that a race or country is the enemy, we can develop hate or prejudice towards them and fall into the same cycle displayed during WWII. A recent example would be the global pandemic COVID-19, in which the world was trying to find someone to blame for the virus, and people from Asia were targeted.","1. 90 - Your response accurately captures how Hitler utilized racial theories and antisemitism to rally the German populace around a common enemy, setting the stage for conquest. You could enhance your answer by discussing the impact of these beliefs on Hitler's policies and actions leading up to and during the war.   2. 85 - You effectively argue that Americans are not immune to such appeals, referencing recent events that illustrate how quickly societal biases can be weaponized. Incorporating more about the historical patterns of similar appeals in the US could provide a deeper insight into the cyclical nature of these issues.  Great job in addressing both questions with relevant examples. Keep in mind the importance of complementing historical analysis with detailed examples to deepen the understanding.

Joselyn De La Cruz,"Hitler influenced the German people by saying that the Jews betrayed Germany and he created a hierarchy with Germans being superior. Hilter wanted to unite German-speaking people into a greater Germany and believed that the Untermenschen people of Eastern Europe were undeserving of their lands, so he wanted to conquer them. Anybody in Hilter’s path was to be exterminated for obstructing his plan of Germany’s expansion. At the time, desperate Germans felt empowered by Hitler’s Mein Kampf and Aryan ideals. As Americans, we have a history of anti-semitism. During Hitler’s period, the United States made decisions such as turning away Jewish people on boats back to Germany which led to them going to concentration camps. Additionally, Americans viewed Jews as foreigners and that they were the ones who killed Jesus. The United States was not immune to this appeal because Germany was moving eastward and Britain appealed to Roosevelt to help defend democracy against Hitler and Mussolini. Furthermore, the United States agreed to send troops to defeat threats in Europe and this agreement was in effect before the Pearl Harbor events.","Grade: 87  Comments: You have successfully summarized how Hitler utilized racial theories and historic antisemitism to consolidate power and justify his aggressive policies. Your explanation of the hierarchical racial theory advanced by Hitler, his goals for a greater Germany, and the targeting of ""Untermenschen"" captures the essence of the lecture. You correctly note America's relationship with these ideas, highlighting instances of anti-Semitism within the U.S., and how these sentiments, to an extent, mirrored those in Germany. However, your response could be enhanced by more directly addressing how Hitler's appeal to racial purity and national greatness specifically unified Germans towards war—a central point in the lecture. Moreover, while you touch upon the American response to Jewish refugees and the broader geopolitical stance of the U.S. leading into WWII, your analysis might improve by more directly exploring the American susceptibility to similar types of appeals, beyond just a shared history of anti-Semitism. It's crucial to distinguish between the U.S. government's strategic decisions and public sentiment towards racial and ethnic minorities when discussing immunity to such appeals.  Supportive feedback: Your response demonstrates a good understanding of the complex interplay between Hitler's racial theories, his strategic objectives, and the broader context of antisemitism, including in the U.S. To further improve, try to directly link these elements to how they specifically influenced German unity towards war and examine more critically how similar appeals might manifest or be resisted in the U.S. Keep up the good work!

Georgia Goldstein,"1. Germans believed that jews ""sold out their country"" and hitler made sure people thought that jews had betrayed Germany. He also made people believe that germans were the superior race. Hitler weaponized antisemitism. 2. Americans also had antisemitic views towards jews and felt they were foreigners. As for this question though, I'm a bit confused. I think we see in today's society that many Americans are not immune to any appeal. There's a rise of antisemitism today from many people who are very uneducated and uninformed and it's extremely dangerous for jewish people. Some Americans on the other hand ARE immune to this appeal and know that it is wrong to hate anyone simply for race, ethnicity, etc.","1. Grade: 85 Your response correctly identifies key points about how Hitler rallied the German people using racial theories and historic antisemitism. It highlights Hitler's portrayal of the Germans as a superior race and his weaponization of antisemitism. However, for a more comprehensive answer, detailing the specific use of Mein Kampf and the broader historical context of antisemitism in Europe would have strengthened your answer.  2. Grade: 80 You correctly pointed out that Americans are not entirely immune to such appeals, referencing the current rise in antisemitism. Your response acknowledges the complex reality that while some Americans resist these appeals, others do not. To further improve your answer, incorporating the lecture's caution about political figures exploiting bigotry for power could have provided a more in-depth analysis.  Overall, your submission reflects an understanding of the lecture's main points. Particularly well done on recognizing the nuanced reality that not all Americans respond the same way to divisive appeals. Keep striving to incorporate more comprehensive historical context and explicit connections to the lecture material, as this will enhance the depth of your analysis.

Lily Youngdale,1. Hitler used his power and control of certain lands to make the German people into waging war if conquest. 2. Americans are not immune to this type of appeal.,"1. Grade: 40 Your response touches on Hitler's use of power for wartime mobilization but lacks detail on how he specifically utilized racial theory and historic antisemitism to unify Germans. Remember, the lecture highlighted Hitler's ideology as articulated in Mein Kampf, where he posited Germans as a superior race and Jews as scapegoats for Germany's problems, rallying the nation around these notions. Expanding on these points would have strengthened your answer.  2. Grade: 60 You correctly state that Americans are not immune to such appeals, aligning with the caution provided in the lecture about the dangers of politicians weaponizing racist instincts for power. However, your response could be enhanced by integrating examples or reasoning from the lecture to more thoroughly support your assertion.  Your answers provide a basic overview but lack the detailed explanations and connections to the lecture material that could have solidified your arguments. Exploring the specific mechanisms Hitler used for racial unification and providing examples or further explanation as to why Americans are also susceptible to divisive appeals would have enriched your submission.

Jake Miranda,1) Hitlers racist worldview created a hierarchy with Germans at the pinnacle followed by other Europeans and descending degrees of worthiness. Hitler's plan began with uniting all German people into greater Germany or third Reich then he would focus eastward into Europe. He promoted the false narrative that Jews had betrayed Germany while proclaiming the superiority of the German master race. 2) As Americans we are immune to this type of appeal because racism and antisemitism wouldn't have the same effect on people as it did in World War II.,"1) 85 Your description of Hitler's racist worldview and his steps towards unifying Germans is well-aligned with the lecture's content. You accurately capture the essence of Hitler's ideology and plans for expansion. However, mentioning how Hitler weaponized antisemitism and historic sentiments to achieve this unification would have provided a more comprehensive response.  2) 60 While you accurately identify a sense of optimism about American immunity to such appeals, your response lacks a critical analysis of the lecture's content, which suggests that no nation, including the US, is fully immune to racial or antisemitic appeals if used to weaponize political power. Providing examples from the lecture related to contemporary issues or historical evidence would have strengthened your argument.  Great job describing Hitler's strategy and acknowledging the complexity of these issues in a contemporary American context. Remember, history teaches us about potential vulnerabilities, so it's crucial to apply a critical lens even when evaluating assumptions of immunity against divisive ideologies.
