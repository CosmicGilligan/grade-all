<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p><span>1. Describe how Hitler used racial theory and historic antisemitism to unify the German people into waging a war if conquest.</span></p>
<p><span>he sold the idea that the jews had betrayed&nbsp;Germany in ww1 causing their surrender. he also said that germans were the master race and all others fell under them in a&nbsp;</span>hierarchical order. germans were receptive because it gave them a target to blame for their struggles.</p>
<p><span>2. As Americans are we immune to this type of appeal?</span></p>
<p><span>no. any time we create a division of the in group and out group we risk going down this path.</span></p>
