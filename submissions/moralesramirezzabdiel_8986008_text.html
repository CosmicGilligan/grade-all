  <p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">1. Following Germany's catastrophic circumstances, a deadly misconception that the Jews had had sold out their country spread. This school of thought was advanced by Adolf Hitler in his book "Mein Kampf," where he simultaneously proclaimed the supremacy of the German Master Race. Hitler used this long-standing antisemitism as a weapon and capitalized on it to seize control. Hitler used this scapegoating to his advantage, and the suffering of the German people made them susceptible to his manipulation and supplied a target for their fears.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>He constructed a hierarchy based on this racist mindset, placing Germans at the top and other Europeans below them in decreasing order of merit. Hitler created a false sense of racial solidarity in Germany by taking advantage of the shared white European identity of the people. People accepted his promotion of a mystical Aryan ideal because it gave them a sense of empowerment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. We as Americans are not immune to this type of appeal, as it has been historically seen. People who are in dire situations have a very natural tendency to attempt and assign blame or a target to their fears. The appeals Hitler weaponized persist in many forms across the globe, including the US, to this day. As was demonstrated by the increase in attacks against Asian Americans in 2020 as a result of mistaken COVID blaming. </span></p>
