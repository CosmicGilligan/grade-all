  <p>1. Historically, jews have been persecuted against throughout history and especially in Germany following WWI; Hitler capitalized on the growing hostile sentiment against Jews in Germany as many prominent positions of political power were held by Jews at that time which Hitler then made them out to be scapegoats through his book Mein Kampf by blaming all of Germany's political and economic issues on them, and that it was their fault Germany had lost the War and is in the its dire situation because of that. By otherizing a group of people that the German population already had misgivings against, Hitler was able to secure power in Germany by promising prosperity for the country and to get rid of what was making things bad for the Germans (the Jews in this case) if they only elect him to power. He would then bolster his movement by giving them a central identity that many Germans could rally behind with the Aryan race, which would create the unity and solidarity that Hitler needed to make his force and movement as powerful as it was due to the intense emotional support that people had for him and his ideas because they saw themselves within his vision.</p>
<p>2. No, Americans are not immune to this sensational and extremist form of racial agitation propaganda. Throughout our history we've been swayed by bad faith actors and their words in order to do abhorrent things under the guise of gaining power or economic leverage. One such recent instance was the storming of the capital following the 2020 election, radical media personalities like Alex Jones were able to galvanize a subset of the population to go to the capital in DC and try to stop the election from being certified all because Trump lost and he couldn't admit to losing so he called the election rigged against him even though he was the one already in power. Such rhetoric is harmful because as we saw there are people who believe it and will then do things they normally would not do in the name of what they believe to be freedom and justice and what their "leader" who radicalized them would want.&nbsp;</p>
