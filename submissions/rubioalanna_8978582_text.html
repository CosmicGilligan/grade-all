  <p>1. Hitler used racial theory and historic antisemitism to unify the German people into potentially engaging in war if need be by pointing the blame (scapegoating) to Jews stating that they betrayed Germany and Hitler also appointed the German race as superior to any other especially those of Jewish decent. Due to Hitler's constant indoctrination of these inhumane beliefs, he was able to obtain a huge number of supporters in fighting in the war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. No, as Americans we are not immune to this type of appeal because it is easy to be manipulated if there is someone to point the blame to. An example of this appeal occurring in America not too long ago was when Covid-19 had started. The Asian communities were blamed for the virus even though there was no proof of it but everyone continued to believe the lie because it helped people cope and point the blame to someone. This is not at all a just thing to participate in and I believe that we as a society should become better at not targeting a specific group of people for the benefit of others.&nbsp;</p>
