<li>Hitler was able to use the underlying historic antisemitism to united the German people against one common enemy. By making it so that the German people were the best and that the Jewish and Eastern European were useless, he convinced the suffering Germans to join a war of conquest.</li>
<li>Americans in general are not completely immune to this type of appeal. It can be seen during the pandemic, where Asian-Americans were targeted for hate crimes and violence. This type of appeal can be seen often, against the Chinese or against the Mexicans, it is all the same. From a person to person basis, there are some that support these ideas and some who do not, but the fact that these ideas get the support that they do show that Americans are less immune to these appeals than they would hope.</li>
