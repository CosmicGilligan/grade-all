<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">The government that formed in Germany after the Kaiser abdicated was a republic, but with many Jewish members in key positions. This fueled a dangerous belief in Germany that Jews had sold out their country somehow by engineering a surrender, when Germany could have won WW II. This line of thinking was completely untrue, but that belief took hold and was intensified by Adolf Hitler’s twisted vision in his book ‘Mein Kampf’ (my struggle) and his false narrative about how the Jews had betrayed Germany. In addition, Hitler proclaimed the superiority of the German Master Race, and his racist worldview created a hierarchy with Germans at the top, followed by other Europeans with decreasing amounts of worthiness. Hitler’s plan was to conquer Eastward, unifying all German-speaking people into a greater Germany, the Third Reich, with the fictional Aryan ideal. Those who were not part of this elite group, the subhumans who were undeserving of their lands, would be over-run and exterminated.&nbsp;</span></span></span>
<p class="p1">2. Today we have similar scenario playing out in the United States. We have a malicious moron running for president of the United States of America who is manipulating people’s worst instincts and insecurities. He has weaponized existing prejudices and will continue to lie, abuse, accuse, and betray any American who does not agree with his pathological need to feel secure in power and avoid a life in prison.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">There are desperate, angry people in America looking at this particular individual as a savior for their pain and needs without knowledge of the Constitution, WWII History and the human wretchedness he will bring to this entire nation.</p>
