<p>5.1.2 War in Europe</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe how Hitler used racial theory and historic antisemitism to unify the German people into waging a war if conquest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hitler exploited racial theory and historic antisemitism to obtain power and empower the German people for war. By Hitler creating the false narrative that the Jewish people had betrayed Germany and was engineering their defeat in World War I, Hitler ignited existing prejudices and scapegoated the Jews for Germany's economic and social hardships. Hitler propagated a racist worldview that portrayed &nbsp;Germans as the superior race and Hitler called for the German people to unify under the banner of the Third Reich. This racial ideology justified Hitler's vision of expansion, including conquering Eastern Europe for Lebensraum, or living space, for the German people.</p>

<li>As Americans are we immune to this type of appeal?</li>
</ol>
<p>Hitler's propaganda, and antisemitic views, were not unique to Germany; similar prejudices existed in the United States, just in different forms. While Germany's anti-Semitism was overt and widespread, there were U.S. citizens who also harbored anti-Semitic views, often fueled by previous groups of Eastern European immigration. Regardless of the difference's strategies for propaganda, the underlying appeal of scapegoating and manipulating a societies distress and mistrust to obtain power, transcends all borders. Hitler's ability to exploit existing prejudices underscores the dangers of authoritarianism and the importance of being prudent, against the manipulation of a person or a peoples, fear and hatred for political gain.</p>
