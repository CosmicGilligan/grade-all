  <p>He gained political power through the weaponization of antisemitism. After WW1 and the Great Depression, Hitler exploited the suffering of many German's and used Jews as a scapegoat for this suffering. As he rose in power he was able to use this antisemitism to unite the German people into waging war with other European Nations he claimed the Jews had sold Germany out to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, American's are not immune to this appeal. Sadly, with covid the republicans were able to point to the liberals mistakes as treasonous. As for the democratic tent, they have weaponized political ideology to aggressively oppose any form of conservative thought. With all of the infighting, it seems both sides have done nothing but strip Americans of rights and power. Both sides are now claiming that the other side is evil and only they can fix it. Personally, I believe we are on a very dangerous path to an authoritarian United States. However, that can change if new parties emerge as winners of elections and political ideas/agendas shift back in the favor of the Republic. We have undergone political shifts in the past and I only hope that is the outcome of our future political landscape. Change needs to happen, otherwise at the rate the US is going, to much power in the hands of one party for to long will be disastrous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
