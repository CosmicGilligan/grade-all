Firstly, Hitler promoted the belief that the Jewish people in Germany were responsible for Germany losing World War 1 since there were many Jewish people that had been given key positions during the war. The belief also promotes the idea that Germany could have won the war, but the Jews somehow forced Germany to surrender to the West. During his rule, Hitler would also invent the false belief that Germans were the "Master Race", and that Jews, as well as Americans due to their diversity, were considered the lowest of peoples. Hitler fueling the European hatred for Jewish people would allow him to rally up more supporters for him and his war against the West.</p>
