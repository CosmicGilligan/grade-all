<li aria-level="1"><span>Hitler influenced the German people by saying that the Jews betrayed Germany and he created a hierarchy with Germans being superior. Hilter wanted to unite German-speaking people into a greater Germany and believed that the Untermenschen people of Eastern Europe were undeserving of their lands, so he wanted to conquer them. Anybody in Hilter’s path was to be exterminated for obstructing his plan of Germany’s expansion. At the time, desperate Germans felt empowered by Hitler’s Mein Kampf and Aryan ideals.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>As Americans, we have a history of anti-semitism. During Hitler’s period, the United States made decisions such as turning away Jewish people on boats back to Germany which led to them going to concentration camps. Additionally, Americans viewed Jews as foreigners and that they were the ones who killed Jesus. The United States was not immune to this appeal because Germany was moving eastward and Britain appealed to Roosevelt to help defend democracy against Hitler and Mussolini. Furthermore, the United States agreed to send troops to defeat threats in Europe and this agreement was in effect before the Pearl Harbor events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
