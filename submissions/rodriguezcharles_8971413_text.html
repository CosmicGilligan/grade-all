  <p>1.) Hitler used racial theory in order to blame the Jewish for their role in "selling out" Germany to be divided, as many Jewish people during the time were in high positions of power. Furthermore, Hitler promoted the superiority of a master "Aryan" race, and that Germans were at the top of the hierarchy of race, and anyone else was below them.&nbsp;<br><br>Hitler also unified people to his cause by promoting anti-Semitism and authoritarianism to desperate Germans of the time.&nbsp;<br><br>2.)

Furthermore, America has historically had similar issues, which clearly shows how any country can be affected by radicalist and unfounded beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
