<h1>5.1.2 War in Europe: Georgia Goldstein</h1>

  <p>1. Germans believed that jews "sold out their country" and hitler made sure people thought that jews had betrayed Germany. He also made people believe that germans were the superior race. Hitler weaponized antisemitism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Americans also had antisemitic views towards jews and felt they were foreigners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for this question though, I'm a bit confused. I think we see in today's society that many Americans are not immune to any appeal. There's a rise of antisemitism today from many people who are very uneducated and uninformed and it's extremely dangerous for jewish people. Some Americans on the other hand ARE immune to this appeal and know that it is wrong to hate anyone simply for race, ethnicity, etc.&nbsp;</p>
