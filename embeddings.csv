","1968. We start off the year in 1968 with what's known as the Tet offensive. Right. I know that I don't pronounce it correctly because I can't speak Vietnamese and nobody would teach me how to do it. But at any rate, what happens is on Tet, which is the asian new year, there was an understanding on the part of the Americans that they didn't. Weren't going to be fighting. It was kind of like they thought there was a tacit understanding with the other side that on their. On our days, like Christmas and Easter, we're going to. We're not going to fight. We're going to stand down. And then on your holidays, then you'll stand down so we won't have to worry about an attack. Right. And this is why the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong decided to attack throughout Vietnam. There was a, there was a concerted offensive against all these different. All you can see all these little kind of bur things here, little explosion things. Those are all the places where the Vietnamese and the north vietnamese army and the Viet Cong attacked american forces throughout Vietnam. Okay, what that's going to do is it's going to. Well, first off, let me just say it this way, that the Tet offensive by North Vietnamese was a complete failure. The north vietnamese army was essentially destroyed by the Americans, and the Viet Cong were left pretty much to fight a guerrilla war throughout South Vietnam. So militarily, the Tet offensive was a victory for the United States. Okay, but what happened was that the war in Vietnam was actually televised, that people were actually in Vietnam taking pictures of the battles. And you could see that film on the evening news, right? And here all of a sudden, we hear we're in the United States, and we're sitting around our dinner table at 06:00 p.m. When the news comes on. And now there's a huge offensive going on. It's all through Vietnam. And the reason why this is a problem is because the president and the generals have been telling people all along that the war is almost over. We basically won the war. We're just mopping it up right now. And then we're going to pull all the troops out. And so people are thinking, well, yeah, the war is almost over. And here all of a sudden, there's all this fighting going on. And what that does is it creates a backlash from the point of view of the public. The public are going to say, wait a minute. You've been telling us all along this is all over, and now we find out that it's not all over. You've been lying to us. I mean, I'm shocked. The United States government lying to us. Right? But the thing that you have to keep is that the mentality of this time was that people trusted the government. Right? People trusted the president, and if they said something was true, they would pretty much believe it. Right? But here we have all of a sudden that everything they've been saying is a lie. It's not true. And so even though this was a great military victory for the United States armed services, it was a huge defeat for America and Vietnam because Americans said, we don't want to be part of this anymore. We're done with this. Right? You guys get what? You get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this. So like I said, in 1965, when they sent troops to Vietnam, Americans were almost all for it. But by 1968, Americans are almost all against it. There's still some, there's still hawks and doves, right? But the majority of the american people are against the war now. Okay? Questions, comments about this. All right? Okay. So now that leads to what's called the credibility gap. The credibility gap is you can't believe anything the government says, okay? And for us, I mean, that's just kind of like second common knowledge, like saying the sky is blue, right? But I can tell you right now that if President Biden went on tv and said the sky is blue, there would be chirons flashing across the country saying, well, it's not really blue. It's really all these different colors. And he's lying. You know what I'm saying? And it doesn't matter who it is. It could be Biden or Trump or whoever, right? It's going to be the same thing. Nobody trusts the government. Right. How can you tell a politician is lying? His lips are moving. Right. So, at any rate, I mean, that's the way, that's our attitude towards government, and we can really kind of trace it to this particular event, the Tet offensive. All right. Well, anyway, so now President Johnson, who had actually reluctantly gotten the United States involved in Vietnam because of the cold war, is now coming to realize that he can't win the war in Vietnam and that he's not going to be able to gain election. Re election. I guess he was elected in 64, but he's not going to be able to gain reelection. And so there are challenges within the Democratic Party. Now, one of the things that you'll notice is that the party that's in power, that has a candidate who's running for re election. Like, for example, Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2020. The same party doesn't primary them, right? The same party just lets. Okay, that guy's your guy, right? You get what I'm saying? But they, there were a couple of liberals who actually played Johnson, Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy. And Johnson will realize he's not going to win the election. He's not going to even probably be the candidate. So he, at the end of March, he announces a halt in the bombing. This is the bombing, the operation thunder that I talked about last week. Right? He announces a halt in the bombing and calls for peace talks and announces that he will not run for president, which throws the democratic ticket wide open. Right? You guys with me? Questions, comments about this? Let me just mention something to you about the peace talks, all right? He called for peace talks during 1968, and he really encouraged the president of South Vietnam to participate in these peace talks with the North Vietnamese. And because it was an election year, the republican candidate for president, who turns out to be Richard Nixon, is going to be afraid that if Johnson is able to make or to move toward peace in Vietnam, that would make him so popular that he would win the election. Nixon sends a representative to talk to the president of South Vietnam to convince him not to engage in the peace talks, and he doesn't. And so the war then will drag on for another seven years after this. Right? This is documented. People know that this is true. So you would have to actually call that an act of treason because Nixon was actually acting in favor of our enemies at that point in time. And that's something that people didn't really know until about three or four years ago when the documents were finally unsealed. All right, questions, comments about this? Okay, so in case anybody tells you, any of the older crowd who still believes that Nixon was a great president, that tells you that Nixon was railroaded. Just realize he was not railroaded. Okay. Well, anyway, the point here is that right after that, then there's the assassination of Martin Luther King, and that's going to lead to a lot of riots in the streets. And then not too long after that, Kennedy's assassinated in Los Angeles. Right? And then in 1968, they had the democratic convention in Chicago, which is really almost an image of America in 1968, because there's the establishment Democratic Party inside the convention center and all the hippies and anti war people out in the streets. And what will happen there is that the mayor of Chicago will unleash the police on the demonstrators, and that will be seen on tv. Right? So what ends up happening then is that if you're looking at the 1968, you're looking at tv or an american citizen looking at the tv in August of 1968, and what you see is, and you, the country that you're living in, you see there's a divide between blacks and whites. There's a divide between rich and poor. There's a divide between young and old. There's a divide between conservatives and liberals. And now we see the government, government forces attacking and brutalizing people in the streets. You're going to say, we need law and order, right? And Nixon comes along and he says, I'm going to be your law and order president, right? And not only that, I'm going to end the war in Vietnam. I've got a secret plan to end the war in Vietnam. My first secret plan is to keep it going so that I can end it. Right? But, but then he says, I got, I got a secret, I got a secret plan to end the war in Vietnam, which we never did find out what that was. And then I'm also going to be your law and order president. And that looks pretty good. So Nixon actually wins his election in 1968. Barely, right? Barely. It wasn't a blowout or anything like that, but he did win. And that's going to lead then to really a whole different era in american politics. Not that things are going to get better, but things are going to get different."

","A long standing conflict existed between the French and the English, with most of the initial clashes unfolding in Europe. However, this struggle eventually extended to the Americas. A key point of contention that fueled this rivalry was the Ohio river valley. Let's examine how this came to be. As you can see on this map, the british colonies appear in blue and the french colonies appear in yellow. A fundamental difference existed between french and english colonial settlements in the Americas. English colonists often permanently settled in these colonies, seeking to forge a new life. In contrast, the french presence was largely focused on trade, particularly the lucrative fur trade. Consequently, their relationship with the land differed. The English saw value in land ownership for farming and livelihood, whereas the French prioritized access for trading purposes. Though both french and english colonies existed in America, no clearly defined boundary separated these empires. When english colonists received charters to settle in America, the granted land theoretically extended from the atlantic coast all the way westward. This meant Pennsylvania and Virginia, in theory, stretched to California. Even if the vastness of the continent wasn't fully understood, this ambiguous land ownership became a source of conflict. Both Virginians and Pennsylvanians could claim the Ohio river valley, citing the original royal charters. The Ohio river valley holds particular significance due to its fertile land, ideal for agriculture. This made the area highly desirable for english colonists in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Seeking expansion, land distribution, and economic opportunity. George Washington, our first president and a prominent military leader, performed his first professional role as a surveyor, someone who defines property boundaries. Expeditions were sent from Virginia to survey the Ohio River Valley, a disputed territory. Their goal was to divide and sell the land. Even amidst questions of ownership, tensions between France and Britain over this contested land escalated. In fact, George Washington led a contingent of virginian militia into what is now Pennsylvania. A minor skirmish known as the Battle of Jumanville Glen ensued. Tragically, the french ambassador was killed. This painting depicts the confrontation with virginian colonists approaching french forces. The French accused Washington of assassinating their diplomat, further inflaming tensions. This localized conflict ultimately transformed into a global war between Britain and France fought across Europe, the Caribbean, Asia, and, of course, North America. A small skirmish sparked by a land dispute ignited a worldwide conflict. The war wasn't progressing well for Britain, partly due to a lack of focus on the north american theater. In response, the british parliament instructed the colonies to collaborate and develop a plan to resist the french threat. This wider conflict, known in America as the french and indian war, pitted the british and american colonists against the French and their indigenous allies. While the British expected the colonies to devise a self defense strategy, the colonists themselves were hesitant. A meeting was held in Albany, New York, where a plan for mutual defense was proposed. However, the colonies ultimately proved reluctant to fulfill its requirements. The plan itself was ultimately rejected by parliament. A key takeaway from the Albany plan episode was the profound disunity among the colonies. Several factors contributed to this. Firstly, as this map illustrates, most of the fighting occurred in the north southern colonies, felt geographically distant from the conflict and less inclined to offer aid. The vast distances within North America at the time further exacerbated this perception. Southerners viewed the northern colonies as distinct entities, even regarding them as foreigners with whom they shared little common cause. Recognizing the need for a more focused approach, Britain shifted its attention to the north american theater and deployed troops to the colonies. This troop surge proved decisive, turning the tide of the war in Britain's favor. Their victories over the french and North America ultimately contributed to their overall triumph in the wider Seven Years War, a global conflict spanning seven years, 1756 to 1763. The Treaty of Paris in 1763 formally concluded the war. The treaty awarded Britain a vast territory east of the Mississippi river. With the exception of Florida, which became a spanish possession. France ceded all its remaining north american holdings west of the Mississippi to Spain. This outcome effectively eliminated the french colonial empire in North America, a significant loss that fueled french resentment towards Britain. The french and indian war, while securing british victory in North America, also sowed the seeds of discontent that would later blossom into the American Revolution. The next four lecture segments will explore four key consequences of the war that fueled tensions between the colonies and Britain, the rise of nascent american nationalism, resentment towards british indian policy, taxation without representation, and a widening gulf of distrust between the colonies and Britain.

","A vicious cycle of escalating tensions and miscommunication drove a wedge between Britain and the colonies. British actions, perceived as tyranical by the colonists, were met with increasing resistance. This resistance, in turn, was interpreted by the British as defiance of legitimate authority. Let's consider an analogy. Imagine a parent child relationship where the child has raised themselves to the parent's busy schedules. When the child gets into trouble. The parents, eager to reassert control, enact strict punishments. The child, however, feels unfairly targeted. After years of independence, they argue, why are you suddenly imposing rules when I've been managing on my own? The parents, frustrated, insist on their authority. This breakdown in communication deepens the resentment on both sides. Similarly, the colonists felt increasingly selfsufficient. After decades of self governance, british attempts to tighten control, like tax measures, were seen as infringements on their liberties. These actions fueled a growing sense of alienation among the colonists. Furthermore, inflammatory rhetoric by some colonists further poisoned the well. Much like how some news channels today focus on negativity. Certain colonists sensationalized british actions, portraying them in the worst possible light. This tactic aimed to inflame public opinion against Britain. The colonists, primed to see british actions as tyranny, readily accepted this hostile narrative. Conversely, the british interpreted colonial resistance as defiance rather than a genuine belief in selfdetermination. Fueled by misunderstandings and mistrust, the relationship deteriorated to a point where compromise became nearly impossible. This combustible environment ultimately led to the American Revolution. The T Act of 1773 serves as a microcosm of the larger conflict between Britain and the colonies. On the surface, the act appeared to benefit the colonists. The British East India Company, facing financial ruin, was granted a monopoly on tea sales in America. The Tea act lowered the overall cost of tea, potentially saving colonists money. However, the colonists saw this act through a lens of deep mistrust. They completely disregarded the potential economic benefit for the following reasons. Taxation without representation. The Tea act included a tax on tea. Colonists, adhering to the principle of no taxation without representation, felt they shouldn't be taxed by a parliament in which they had no voice. The tax itself became a symbol of british tyranny, not a revenue generator, a monopoly disguised as a bargain. The colonists viewed the East India Company's monopoly with suspicion. They feared price hikes in the future, even if the initial price was lower. More importantly, being forced to buy from a single source eroded their economic independence. The Tea act perfectly illustrates the communication breakdown. The British, seeking to save a failing company and potentially benefit colonists with cheaper tea, completely misread the situation. The colonists, fueled by a long history of grievances and a deep seated belief in self determination, saw the act as yet another attempt at control and exploitation. This miscommunication and mistrust ultimately led to the Boston Tea Party, a pivotal event on the road to the American Revolution. This concludes our lecture on the great war for empire and its consequences in the british colonies in America. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","All right, so now let's talk about political parties. There was two political parties. We'll talk about them here in a second. I want to give you an overview first, though. When I say an overview, what I mean to say is that there's Republicans and Democrats, but the Republicans and the Democrats are both split. Right. Okay. So the Republicans, there's two groups of Republicans. They're called stalwarts and mugwumps. Right. Stalwarts are people who are kind of rigid ideologically to the party standard, which we'll talk about what that means here in a minute. Right. Mugwumps are people who are more willing to compromise. All right. The word mugwump actually comes from a native language. I'm not sure which one or even what it means. But the way that they used it was that a person who was a mugwump had his mug on one side of the fence and his womp on the other. Right. That's american politics for you. But at any rate, the point is that they're kind of in the middle or they're not really tied to any specific ideology. Right. The Democrats were split between the southern Democrats, who were more. I would say that they're more invested in white supremacy. Right. What you'll notice is that the people that were in control of the south, the Democrats that were in control of the south after the civil war were essentially the same people that were in control of the south before the civil war. Right. And so what we see then is that this ideology of white supremacy continues in the south, and it's represented in the democratic party there. But we'll also notice that the democratic party in other parts of the country is going to become the party of immigrants and the party of labor, party of manufacturers. Like, for example, in Los Mineros. If we were to conjecture the union members, would they be republican or Democrat? They would be Democrat. Right. Okay. So that's the split then, in the Democratic Party. And then there's a number of third parties because a lot of people, as I mentioned, this is an era of social unrest. And so the third parties are going to be representing kind of the major issues that we've been kind of talking about, one we really didn't talk about yet. We'll talk more on Wednesday, prohibition, which means we should stop people from drinking. Right. And that's going to be a policy of the progressives. And we'll see why on Wednesday the Greenback party is going to be in favor of soft money, keeping a lot of currency in the economy. And then the populist party will be the party essentially, of the people, of the agrarian interests. And we're going to talk more about that here in just a few minutes. Now, I want to make an observation about the party system, and the reason why is because there is a misunderstanding or maybe even disinformation coming from certain groups in the United States who will make judgments about the current political situation based on the policies of the republican and democratic parties in the middle of the 19th century, say at around the time of the civil war. Right? Now, before the Civil War, there were actually two parties, but again, they were divided, the Democrats and the Whigs. Right? But the Whigs are divided between northern and southern wigs and the Democrats are divided between northern and southern Democrats. Okay? And what happens is that the Whig party essentially falls apart because its major platform was that they didn't like Andrew Jackson. So by the time we get to 1850s, Andrew Jackson is dead. There's really nothing holding them together. Right. And so it really dissolves. And instead, what happens is a bunch of people get together and form a new party, which they call the Republican Party. It's the GOP, the grand old party of Lincoln. Right. Or actually the grand old party of Jefferson was what it was. But at any rate, the point here is that this party was made up of northern wigs and other groups like New York, Free Soilers and a few other groups, essentially inheriting the politics of the old federalists from the northeast who were in favor of commerce and big business, but also the free soilers who were in favor of restricting the expansion of slavery. Right? So what we really see then is a party that's based on economically, that's based on the interests of big business, but socially is a very liberal party. Right. Because the idea of restricting slavery or abolishing slavery was unthinkable, really, to many people at that time. Right. So the idea here then is that the republican party is the party of big business, and it was also the socially liberal party. And then the democratic party started as the party of Andrew Jackson. The first populist president is the People's Party, but it's also socially conservative, more in line with what we would think of as traditional values, that sort of thing. Right? So if we look at the Democrats and the Republicans during the civil war, again, you see Republicans are the party of big business and also socially liberal, really radical. And the Democrats are the party of the people, but also socially conservative. Okay? Now what happens is, and we'll talk a little bit more about this next week. And as we go on. Right. One of the things that happens as a result of what we're talking about today is there's going to be a new kind of, well, it actually will be a party. There'll be a party called the Populist Party, which is going to be the party of the Farmers, but eventually it will transform into the Progressive Party, which is a party of reform. Right. And then that party will kind of decline, but the policies of the Progressive party will be adopted by the Democratic Party. Right. So by the time we get to the election of 1912, the Republican Party is now the party of big, is still the party of big business, but they've become more socially conservative. They've abandoned the progressives. Right. The Progressive Party was Theodore Roosevelt, who was a Republican, but they've abandoned that aspect and they're more focused now on the economic conservatism. Right. And the Democrat party, led by Woodrow Wilson, will still be the party of the people, of labor and immigrants and that sort of thing. But now they'll also become the socially liberal party. Right. So we'll see then that the Republicans are the party of big business, have always been the party of big business, but they were the liberal party and have become the conservative party. And the Democrats have always been the party of the people, but they were conservative and have become more liberal. Now, the reason why I say that is because if you listen to the radio, which I don't, but if you did, right, or you look at your memes on Facebook or whatever, it'll tell you, oh, well, it was the Republicans that freed the slaves and the Democrats were the slaveholders. Well, yeah, that's true. Right. We're talking about Republicans and Democrats in 1860. We're not talking about Republicans and Democrats in 2021. So if your argument is that the republican party is the party of civil rights because of the 1860s, you're really making a historical mistake. You're not really talking about history as it really happened. And we need to know that. We need to know that. Yeah, the Democrats were the party of white supremacy. Right. But now they're not. Okay? That doesn't mean that no Democrats are white supremacists or that all Republicans are. In fact, there's a group, the people who were in control of the south before the civil war. The Democrats actually took control of the south after the civil war, and they continued their ideology of white supremacy. Okay, so then going into the 20th century, we see that these southern Democrats, as the rest of the Democratic, becomes more progressive, the southern Democrats are going to become more disaffected. Right. So in the 1940s, and democratic party will become the party of civil rights, and that will alienate these southerners, democratic southerners who are the party of white supremacy, as we hear George Wallace, segregation now, segregation forever. And what happens is that as they become disaffected with the Democratic Party, they will go to the Republican Party. Right. So that's why if we look at the south today, it's almost all Republican. Well, it's not because they favor big business so much as the fact that they were alienated from the Democratic Party by the civil rights stance and that Richard Nixon actually appealed to them at what was called the southern strategy to get them to vote for him because he dog whistled, essentially saying that I'm on your side, basically appealing to the voters that supported George Wallace, the southern segregationist. So the history of the party system is a lot more complex than just the Republicans now are the same as the Republicans then and same with the Democrats. Right. It's a complex transition that happens over time. Right?"

","All right, so now, this is another very important topic, and it has to do with the judiciary. And you'll recall last week, when we talked about the structure of the federal government, that the judiciary is one of the three branches. But when they wrote the constitution, it wasn't really clear what the purpose of the judiciary was. Okay. And. And the one of the reasons why it wasn't really clear was because it wasn't clear that the federal government had the right to interpret the constitution. Okay? There were, as you guys will recall, I said there were a number of states that believed that they should be the final word on what was constitutional and what wasn't. And basically that if the states saw that a federal law was against their interest, they could just ignore it or they could nullify it. Right? And so we have this. This background conflict of those who believe in the supremacy of the federal government and those who believe in the supremacy of the state government. Right. And into the middle of this, we come with John Adams. John Adams, when he leaves office, basically decides to pack the courts with federalist judges. And so they pass the Federalist Congress, as one of its last measures, is going to expand the judiciary so that the federal court system, so that essentially, that Adams can. Can appoint a number of federalists to the judiciary, which will mean that the federalists at least have control of one branch of the government. Okay, so those people who think, oh, well, the Supreme Court and the court system is supposed to be non political. Well, it's always been political. Right. And the reason why it's always been political is because the justices or judges in the judicial system are all appointed by the president, and the president is political. You guys get what I'm saying? But the kind of the caveat there is that once the. Once a person has been appointed to the judiciary, they serve for life. So if you appoint somebody that, say, in their forties or fifties, they could serve for 2030 years. Right. Whereas the president can only serve for four years at a time, and, congressman, only two. Right. You follow what I'm saying? All right, so. So these political appointments to the judiciary have long term effects. That's one of the things that. One of the things that we'll notice as we go forward in your lifetimes is going to be that essentially, the Trump administration was able to do almost the same thing that Adams did. What really happened was that the Republicans refused to confirm nominees to the court until Trump was president. And then once he was president, they filled the court system with very conservative justices. And those conservative justices are gonna be on the court for 20 or 30 years. You guys follow what I'm saying? So this is gonna have a long term effect. All right? I'm not saying it's gonna be a good effect or bad effect. I'm just saying that's gonna have a long term effect. Right? Okay. So what happens then is that Adams appoints a number of justices right at the end of his term. This is where we come up with the term lame duck. You've heard of lame duck before, right? Lame duck. A lame duck is somebody that is still in power but is not going to be reelected. Right? So the last two months of Trump's term were the Islam duck period. Right. And the lame duck period is a politically safe zone because you can do things without having to pay a political price. Right? And this is when you'll see presidents start to pardon people. It's not just presidents. I mean, governors and people like that. Right? They'll pardon people that are unpopular, things like that, because they know they don't have to pay a political price for it. Okay. And so one of the things that. That Adams does is during this lame duck period, he makes a number of appointments, a lot. A large number of appointments to the judicial. And. And he was, he was busy doing it all the way up until midnight on the day that Jefferson was going to be inaugurated. Okay. And so they. So they. Sorry. So they called these judges midnight judges, right. Because they were still signing their commissions at midnight. But once midnight had passed, they could no longer sign those commissions. Right. And so there was a guy, and his name was Marbury. I always forget his first name. It may have been James, but I'm not sure. Anyway, Marbury was appointed to a position of justice of the peace in Maryland by the Adams administration, but his commission was never signed. Sorry. And when Jefferson became president, he told his secretary of state, James Madison, to stop signing him. Stop signing the commissions. And then the Judiciary act, where they expanded the judiciary in 1801, was repealed by the new Republican Congress. Democratic Republican Congress. And so all of those new judge positions that had been created are now rescinded. They're not there anymore. Right. And so what had really happened here was that this guy Marbury had been promised a job by the federal government, but he never got the job because they never signed the commission. And so he sued in court, and it made its way through the court system until it got to the Supreme Court. Okay? And what happened in the Supreme Court was that the Supreme Court ruled that Marbury should have gotten his job, but that the court didn't have jurisdiction. So it sounds like a weird kind of outcome, because really, if you think about it, Jefferson really, in a way, lost. But he also won. I mean, the guy, Marbury, never got the job, so that way. But he lost in a bigger way because what it did was set the precedent for the Supreme Court to be the final judge of what's constitutional and what isn't, the Supreme Court versus the state. And so this really gives an enormous amount of power to the federal government through the Supreme Court. You follow what I'm saying here? Because that's the tradition. That's where we come up with our idea, the tradition of judicial review. Judicial review means that the Supreme Court basically is the final arbiter of what is constitutional and what isn't, and it's not the states. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying here? So this is an important incident, right, in this case, Marbury versus Madison. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying here. Questions, comments? Now, Marshall, John Marshall, was Tom's cousin, but they didn't agree politically. And one of the things that you will notice is that Marshall was on the court until 1835. Jefferson was in office until 1808. So you can see Marshall was put on the court by Adams, and he stayed there for 34 years, whereas both Adams and Jefferson were dead while Marshall was still on the court. You guys get what I'm saying? So this is the effect of the, these appointments to the federal court system. You guys follow me here. And that's why, that's why so many people, when there is an election, people start talking about, well, if so and so becomes president, they're going to do something such and such to the court system, and that will have a long term effect. That's why it's so important. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about any of this."

","All right, well, here's the problem. The problem is Texas applies for admission to the union, but they're denied. Okay? The Congress doesn't allow the admission of Texas to the union. Texas applied for admission as a slave state. Now, the reason why Texas was denied admission, there's actually two reasons. One is because Mexico had a large, well trained, european style army, and the United States had none. Had no army. Essentially, a bunch of militias. Right? And Mexico had made it clear that if Texas became part of the United States, that would be a declaration of war. And the United States did not want to go to war with Mexico at that time because they thought Mexico was stronger. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? And they would have been, too, if it wasn't for the fact that they were in such political upheaval. All right, the second reason why is because slavery is now a polarizing issue in Congress, and it's very difficult to. So where to move forward? It's very difficult to admit any state to the Union, slave or free, because the slavery issue is so divisive. Do you guys follow? I'm saying? So Texas is denied admission for two reasons. One, because Americans are concerned they wouldn't be able to win a war against Mexico. And number two, because of the issue of slavery. Okay, but. But the way that the proponents of manifest destiny explain it is by saying that while Texas wasn't ready. Okay, keep in mind that the proponents of manifest destiny are saying that the only way that. That, uh. That states can be added to the temple liberty is if they're ready. And the. These people, led by the guy I just showed you here, John L. O'Sullivan. And, in fact, this is what he's writing about in this essay, right? Is that in 1836, Texas was not ready to be part of the United States because they didn't have the necessary tradition of liberty. Okay, you guys following here? Questions? Comments? Keep in mind that every other. Every other state had that had been added to the union since the revolution had been a territory first. But Texas was never a territory of the United States. It was a territory of Mexico. All right, so. Or of the spanish empire. All right, so Texas is denied admission. But what O'Sullivan argues is that by 1845, they have become ready to be added to the union. Now, why would he write this in 1845? The reason why is because in 1845, Congress annexed Texas. All right? Congress acted to add Texas as a state to the United States, okay? And so this article about manifest destiny is an argument about why taxes should be added to the United States. Because they're ready. You guys. You guys follow I'm saying here? Okay, so when. When Congress annexed Texas, they recognized that there was a difference of opinion between Mexicans and Texans over what was the border. And so Congress did not declare a border. They just said that they would negotiate the border with the. With the Mexicans when they annex Texas. All right, you guys are following here. Any questions? Comments? Okay, so now what happens is that there's a. There's an election in 1844. The man who's elected president is James K. Polk. And James K. Polk was a believer in american expansion, and particularly what James K. Polk wanted was San Francisco. Why would James K. Polk want San Francisco? Remember that the United States is, on the one hand, a trading country, but the traders in the United States are located here in the northeast, right? And the only way that they can get to Asia is to go either around Africa or around South America. So that puts them at a disadvantage to all the other european traders. But if they could control San Francisco, then they would have direct access to China. You follow what I'm saying? So they want. The Polk wants, and the Democrats. The Americans want California because they want to be able to trade with China. Okay, so what happens then is that Polk sends a representative, his name is John Slidell, from Louisiana to Mexico to negotiate the sale of California. Okay, now let me just tell you briefly about California. California was very sparsely settled, like Texas or even worse. Right? Hardly any Mexicans lived there after independence, there was a split between northern and southern California, and they were fighting amongst each other over who was the real California. And there were a number of Americans that were also moving in to California, and there was a concern on the part of the Mexicans that Americans would eventually, eventually take over. Okay. But there was already a lot. There were already a large number of people in California who were ready to become part of the United States. And so when Slidell, John Slidell, goes to Mexico City to negotiate the sale of California, what happens is that the critics of the government, the opposition to the government, is going to spread the rumor that Slidell is there to actually purchase taxes. And that is such a hot button issue in Mexico City that the government falls. The government, the government loses control, and there's a period of political instability, right? So the Slidell mission actually failed, and the Americans got nothing. Right? You guys are with me. But now. Now what happens next is that Polk decides that rather than because there's nobody to negotiate with and he can't buy the territory, they're going to take it all right. And so he makes plans for. For taking really all of the. What we call the southwest today. Right. It was the northwest for the mexican point of view. But he did was he sent an army from Texas to the do Grande, and he established a fort there called Fort Brown, which is today Brownsville, Texas. Right. And the reason why he did this was because he knew that the Mexicans believed that the Rio Grande was well within their border. Right. Because, if you will recall, Mexicans believed that the border of Texas was at the Nueces and the border of the United States was at the Sabine. Right. And that the Rio Grande was nothing. And so by putting an army on the Rio Grande, what essentially polk is doing is inviting a response, because from the point of view of the Mexicans, this looks like an invasion. Right? And, in fact, if you go to Mexico today and you ask them about this war, they don't call it the mexican american war. They call it the invasion, the north american invasion in which we lost half of our territory. Right. And you can see from their point of view that it was. It was an invasion from their point of view. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. So what happens next in. Is that Mexican. There's a mexican general who crosses the Rio Bravo and attacks the Americans at Fort Brown. Okay? Now, the Americans were able to actually win the battle, but the news of that attack reaches Washington, and Polk uses that news to demand a declaration of war from Congress. Okay? So basically what he does is he dumps a whole bunch of documents on Congress and says, I need a declaration of war, and I need it in 24 hours. And Congress didn't have the time to actually go through all the documents. And so within 24 hours, he had his declaration of war. The thing is that, like I said, they didn't. There were people who were concerned that they weren't really being told everything they needed to know, but they were also concerned that they didn't want to vote against the troops. Right. They feared kind of political repercussions for being against the war that a lot of people were in favor of. And so the United States voted to declare war. And then later, what's going to happen is that they realize that basically what Polk had said about the mexican invasion of the United States was untrue, but by that time, uh, they were already committed. So. So that meant then that there was. There was no way to actually pull the troops back, because if you pull the troops back, then that's not supporting the troops. And you know what happens when you don't support the troops. Right. Okay, so. So the United States is then basically duped into going to war with Mexico, and the United States starts to win a lot of battles right up front. So the United States really pretty much takes over northern Mexico quickly. There is an expedition that leaves Missouri, Kansas, Fort Leavenworth, that marches to California, led by Stephen Carney, Carney High School, right down the street from Mesa College. And so within weeks, the United States actually already controls everything that they want from Mexico. And so they want the war to be over now, but because there isn't a stable government in Mexico City, there's nobody to negotiate with. You follow me here. And so what happens then is that Polk decides to invade Mexico from Veracruz. All right? Vera Cruz, if you guys will recall, was the place where Cortez started his conquest of Mexico. And the mexican army, then, led by General Winfield Scott, will march across Mexico into Mexico City. And then on September 14, 1846, the United States army enters Mexico City. All right, so this painting here shows the center of Mexico City. It's called a Sokolo, and all these buildings are still there. This is the national cathedral. This was the national palace, right. What you can't see in this, in this painting is that the american flag is flying over the national palace, right? So now you have to consider what you would think if you saw, say, an iranian flag flying over the United States Congress. Angry. Angry, exactly. And this is what Mexicans felt. Mexicans were angry that the United States had taken over their capital, and they're still angry. Okay. Now Americans will say, well, that was a long time ago. You guys should just get over it. Right? Right. But we forgot about it. A lot of you guys probably didn't even know about most of this stuff, right? But the Mexicans didn't forget. All right? And I remember when I was in Mexico City doing research, I was at the National History Museum at Chapultepec, and there was a room in that museum called the room of the interventions, and it showed all the different times that, that Mexico had been intervened in by foreign governments, United States, the French, and the Spanish, right? And I remember them bringing little school kids through the room and pointing out to the, to the paintings and say, look, this is what the Americans did to us, right? So they didn't forget. And what we're going to see in american perception, America's perception in Spanish, America is going to change overnight from one of an ally in the revolution of liberty to an enemy, a predator that's to be feared. American relations with Spanish America are shaped by this event of the United States invading Mexico and taking its territory. Okay? And even though, you know, we go to Mexico and we're the good guys, you should like us, right? But they're very suspicious. And you can understand why, if you understand the mentality behind their understanding of what they call the north american invasion in which they lost half of their territory."

","All right, well, now let's move on to the issue of modernization. Okay, you guys have probably heard the term modernization, but I think it's probably a little different from what you are used to thinking about or the way you used to think about it. And so let's just go ahead and start with that. I'm going to define modernization as to look like the west. Right. And what that means is that a country has an industrialized economy and a liberal government. All right, so industrialized, we just talked about what was an industrialized economy, and we're going to talk about in a few minutes why industrialization leads to democratization. But remember, we talked about earlier what we mean when we say liberty with an exclamation point. It's three different things. What are they like? Freedom. Look in your nose. Produce freedom to make money. I don't remember exactly. Well, that's part of it. That's capitalism. Right? Capitalism was the third one. Les fair capitalism. Les a fair. Right. So that was the third one. The first one, though, was what? One person, one vote. Democracy. Popular sovereignty. Democracy. Democracy. And then there was one in the middle that had to do with religion. What was that? Secularism. Democracy. Secularism, capitalism. Don't forget. Right. Democracy, secularism, capitalism. Because all three of those things together are called liberalism. In order to be a modernized country, you have to have an industrial economy and a liberal government. Okay. There were instances of countries that had the industrial economy, but their government wasn't very liberal, but they were not very long lasting. Okay, let's think about what countries then would we say were modernized countries? Can you guess which countries in the world in, say, 1800, which countries had industrial economies and liberal governments? The west. Right? Which one? So the west countries. Europe. Okay. What part of Europe? It's actually not all of Europe, but you're right, it's western Europe. So we're talking about United States, Britain, France, Germany, Germany, Belgium, not Spain, not Italy, not Russia. Right. Just those. So we have England, France, Belgium, Germany, and that was it. Right. England, France, Belgium, Germany. United States is one of these modernized countries and modernizes in the second half of the 19th century after the civil war. So modernization is going to be associated with Europe and the United States, western Europe and the United States. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, we didn't talk about this much, but we'll talk about it now. And what happens is, and this actually goes all the way back to the discovery of America. When America was discovered, Europeans gained access to crops that made it possible for less people to produce enough food to feed more. So, if you'll recall, I think. I'm pretty sure I mentioned to you that during the Middle Ages, the population of Europe was essentially stagnant, meaning that it stayed constant. Every now and then it would go through a growth spurt, but then there'd be a famine or a plague, and it would go back to somewhere around normal. So the population of Europe essentially was stagnant throughout the Middle Ages. But after the discovery of America, they discovered a staple crop that made it possible for less people to produce more food. Does anybody know what that crop was? Wheat. Corn? Wheat. It was neither one, actually. The big one was they already had wheat. They didn't have corn, but that was something they would get. But the big one was potatoes. I know that sounds very unsexy, doesn't it? Right. But in reality, what happens was the introduction of the potato into Europe made it possible for the european population to start to grow. And it continued to grow from then all the way up until after World War II. And after World War II, it starts to decline, like in the United States. But at any rate, the point here is that making it possible for less people to produce more food disrupts the agrarian economy, because now people that had been necessary before to grow food so that everybody had enough are no longer needed. Right? So I don't know if you guys will remember or maybe have watched or experienced the Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Right. And I'm sorry, I was just saying, Dickens. One of the things that Scrooge says in there is let them die and decrease the surplus population. What's he talking about when he says surplus population? He's talking about there's more people available to work than there is work for them to do. You get what I'm saying? This is one of the reasons why the factory owners were able to keep the wages so low is because if one person didn't work, the next person, they could get somebody else to do it. Right? Okay. What then happens is that because they are no longer needed on the thieves in the agrarian, in the fields, and also because the new owners of these fiefdoms, the bourgeoisie essentially are closing off fencing in the field so that the peasants can no longer work them, then they are going to move. And where are they going to move to? Well, they're going to move to the cities because that's where the factories are and that's where they're going to be able to essentially try to find some work. And so they'll move. Let's say, from somewhere in the middle of nowhere in England to Manchester, which is an industrial city. But once they get to Manchester, they realize that there's hardly any work there because there's so many workers. So they'll book passage on a ship to America. Right. They'll either go to the United States and I go to Mexico or Brazil, Argentina. They'll go throughout the Americas. What that will do then is lead to a massive movement of people from actually throughout the 19th century. Okay, so that's going to be something that accompanies, when I talked about the potato, that is going to be. What's the word I'm looking for? It's going to be supplemented or exacerbated by the fact that they introduced new technologies to agriculture, like rotating crops and things like that, so that they can make more food, but they don't need as many people to make it. Okay, so that's going to be then the, essentially what we see then is that instead of the world or the western world, the industrial world being a world centered on villages, it becomes a world centered on urban areas, on cities, and we start to see huge cities grow. London, New York, Austin. Right. These are ten times or more bigger than any of the biggest cities in the world during the Middle Ages. Right. In the 19th century. Okay, questions? Comments about this? Not San Diego. San Diego. So a little baby in the 1850."

","All right, well, now, there's different groups of natives living in the Americas that the Spanish will encounter. As I already mentioned to you, the Spanish encountered the natives in the Caribbean first, who were a subsistence economy, and then later they would actually, they encountered the Mayans first. But their main advance, I guess, or aggression, you could say, was against this group of natives here, which we call the Aztecs. And if you look at, it's hard to see on this slide, but if you look on this map here or this map down here, the purple area is designated the aztec empire. All right, well, that's a misnomer in many different ways. Okay? So the first thing is that the group that is dominant in this area are called Mexico. And that's where we get the word Mexico. And the reason why they're dominant is because they were at one time a group of outsiders. Because what you'll see on this map, you see the colored area is the civilized area, and the yellow area here is the really non sedentary area. Okay? There are some civilizations up here, but for looking at the spanish empire, we'll look at this part. This area had been civilized for a long time. And if you look at this area here, you'll see. And again, it's very difficult to see on this screen, but there are a number, really, there are hundreds, almost 700 different cities in this area. And they're like the city states of ancient Greece. So each one has its own leader and its own rule set, its own culture, its own politics, its own gods, right? There's a common culture among all of these based on the language. And the language is Nawat, which is a language that's still spoken in Mexico, in the center of Mexico, because this whole area, what really unified this area wasn't politics. It was the language, right? The language and the culture, the set of gods and that sort of thing that went with it. And it's called Nawat, based on the Nawat language. Okay? So all of these little different city states had in common. It's very much like in Europe. If we think about Europe at this know, there was England and there was France, and there was Germany, and there was Spain, and each one of those little areas was divided up into a bunches and bunches of other little areas, and they all had their own languages and their own dialects. But there was a common language, the language, Latin, that all of the people spoke in common. That's called the langua franca. And that's what we see here. There's all these different little political areas, but they all have the one language in common. So each group would speak their own language plus nawat. Does that make sense to you guys? Okay. Now, when the Meshika, they were among the non sedentary people who moved into this area, they were interlopers. And the reason why this area was a target for the so called non civilized people was because this is where all the wealth was. Right? So if you could get into this area, you could take stuff. And in order to do that, obviously you had to be very warlike. And the Meshika were okay. And so they moved in here. They were not wanted. They were not welcomed by the other groups in the area. And so they were essentially consigned to an area in the middle of a lake in the valley of Mexico. And in that, what they did was they actually built a city on the lake. The name of the city was Tenochtitlan. And the center of Tenochtitlan is where the center of Mexico City is today. Right? So that whole area in the center of Mexico. I don't know if you guys have ever been to Mexico City, but there's an area called the Socalo, which is a square, a great square in the middle of the city that was underwater originally. And there's actually, if you're down there, they have a poll outside the national cathedral that shows where the water level was. So all that was underwater. But the natives built that up. The Meshika built that up. And then, being very warlike, they became dominant among the Nawat. Not by creating a land empire like we would think of it. Like, for example, in the Roman Empire, at this height of the roman empire, they built a wall, and they said, okay, everything on this side of the wall is the roman empire. Everything on the other side is not the roman empire. Instead of that, what the Meshika did was they essentially were shakedown artists. They would go to the different cities with their armies, and they would say, okay, let's make a deal. You pay up and we won't kill you. Right? Essentially. Right. And so what would happen would be then that they would subdue a city by demanding tribute. And then if the city agreed to pay the tribute, then they would be left alone except for collection of the tribute. The tribute would be like turquoise and cacao beans and gold and things like that. But the main point here is that as long as they paid up, they were free to do whatever they wanted. So they didn't have a sense of a unified nation. They didn't really owe allegiance to the Meshika. They just had to pay so you can imagine that that kind of a situation will lead to a lot of resentment because essentially what the Aztecs or the meshika were, were tax collectors, and nobody likes the tax collector. Right. And there wasn't any sense of unity among these different groups when the Spanish came. What they found was that there were a lot of unhappy subjects of the Aztecs or the meshika, and they could exploit that to bring about the fall of the meshika, which we'll talk a little bit about more in a few minutes. You might wonder why they're called Aztecs. And the reason why is because in the 19th century, there was a german scholar, I guess you could say, Alexander von Humboldt, and he theorized that the place where the natives came from, the meshika, was called Astlan. And nobody actually knows where Astlan was. That's what the natives themselves said, that they came from Asthlan. But if they came from Asthlan, then that would mean that they were azteca. Right. Ozlan leads to azteca. Okay, so that's where we get the word aztec. But nobody called them Aztecs until the 19th century. Well, okay, so there's two other groups we're going to talk about. The next group also is united by language, the Mayans. They're only united by language. And that's one of the things that's accurate about this map. If you look at the map, it says that it calls this the mayan cultural area. And what was is there were 52 different groups of natives in here who all spoke a similar language, Mayan. But they were always at war with each other. They were constantly at war with each other. And not only that, when the Spanish came, they found cities, but really nobody was living in them. And the question then becomes, well, were they not living in the cities because these cities were just for ceremonial purposes, or did they at one time live in the cities and then move out? And we don't really know the answer to that. But the second one probably is closer to the truth, because in the cities, they were vulnerable. And so what they did was they were driven out into the countryside where they could evade marauding armies from the other cities. Right. The main point here is that the Mayans were very warlike, very hostile. They were hostile to the Spanish and they were hostile to each other, and they would remain that way all the way up into the 19th century. All right, questions? Comments? If anybody says anything about the mayan empire, there was never a mayan empire. Okay. The Mayans were always divided, and the Spanish were able to take advantage of that. All right, then, lastly, we have the Inca of Peru. The Inca were different from the Mesoamericans because they actually were an empire like the Roman Empire. And what had happened within basically the last hundred years before the Spanish arrived was that a group of natives was able to conquer and unify all of this. And the strength of this was that everybody was acculturated into the Inca empire, which meant that everybody owed allegiance to the great Inca. But the problem with that was that all of the authority was located in the person of the great Inca, who at the time of the spanish arrival, was Atajualpa. What that meant was that whatever the Inca said, everybody had to do and what would end up happening is that Spanish, under Pisaro, will take Atawalpa hostage and force him to order the delivery of gold. And that's going to be essentially because they control the authority, they are able to control the empire. And so this mighty huge empire essentially will fall under the dominion of the Spanish because they were able to take away the leader. All right, so this is what we see the Spanish encountering when they come to America."

","All right. So now let's just talk briefly about the progress of the war and what I've done here. You can, again, this is all on canvas. You can go look at it. But I put together a chart here with what I consider to be probably the most important moments of the civil war, keeping in mind that I've put 123-456-7789 battles here, but they were somewhere around 10,000 battles in the civil war. Right. So I'm just going to talk about the big ones. All right. And so the first one happens in right outside of Washington at a place called Manassas, Virginia. And one of the places, one of the things you'll notice is that, is that the north and the south have different names for the battles. Right? So in the north they call this first battle bull run. First bull Run. And the south calls it the Battle of Manassas. Right. Okay. And it's just because it's different people, they have different names for the creek that's there. It's Manassas Creek or Bull Run, depending on how you look at it. Right. Well, the way that this battle was fought was, and again, keep in mind that everybody thought this was going to be, you know, glorious. And so this is right outside of Washington, DC. See if I can find a map here that will show us this. I can't read my map here. I'm not sure that we're going to be able to see. But. But Manassas is right outside of Washington, DC. Right. In fact, it's really close to, it's close enough that people can go out there on their carriages. Right. And so what happened was everybody in Washington, all the kind of elite people, thought, hey, there's going to be a big battle. It's going to be cool. Let's go watch, let's pack our picnic lunches, and we'll go sit and we'll watch the battle happen and we'll watch the union win the war. What happens then is the whole, a large number of people who come out to the battlefield to be witnesses, to be an act, to be the audience. Right. Like it's going to be a football game or something. Okay. And so keeping in mind that then there the confederate troops then meet with the, with the Union troops, the confederate general in charge really is Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard. And he sets up his headquarters in the kitchen of a local farmer. The outdoor kitchen. Right. And then the Union general is Erwin McDowell. Okay. And at the beginning of the battle, the Union starts to push the Confederacy back. One of the incidents that comes out of this is that there was one group of Confederates led by the commandant of the Virginia Military Institute named Thomas Jackson, who refused to fall back, and he's going to be an inspiration to other leaders on the confederate side. One of them will cry out, look, there stands Jackson like a stone wall. And so he becomes known as. Come on, you guys. Stonewall Jackson. Stonewall Jackson, exactly. All right, so that's where that comes from. And then what happens? This is actually the first battle in history where the. Where more troops are brought to the battlefield by train in the middle of the battle, right? And that's what happens. The Confederates are able to pull up to bring in more troops, and eventually what happens is they start to push the Union troops back. But now, by this time, the spectators have come to realize that this isn't as much fun as they thought it was going to be, watching people get killed. And so they all pack up their stuff and get in their carriages and go back to Washington. But when they do that, they block the road, which means that the Union army can't withdraw in an orderly fashion, and instead, they turn around and they run. Right. So this first battle makes it look like the Union is incredibly weak and the Confederacy is incredibly strong. You guys get what I'm saying here? It really sets the kind of tone for the next couple years of the war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about any of this? One thing I should mention before we go on. And that is to say that even though the Confederates were winning battles, the Union was always winning the war, because even though the Union might lose more men or lose battle, they could always replace them because they had the population to do it. But when the south lost men, they couldn't replace them. Right? So as long as the war kept going on, the south was closer to losing because they couldn't replace their losses. Okay, just keep that in mind. All right? Okay, so now we move on to the next battle. The guy who was put in charge of the. Of the army after McDowell was a man named George McClellan. George McClellan called himself the Napoleon of the west. So that kind of shows you his sense of self, right. But it also shows us that he's very much interested in politics. Remember that Napoleon became the emperor of France, okay? So he's going to be a very cautious general, and what's going to happen is that Lincoln will order McClellan to take Richmond, and the way that he's supposed to do that is he's supposed to take his army down the Chesapeake Bay land on the Yorktown peninsula. This is the same place where the Americans won the revolutionary war and then march to take Richmond. Okay, and what happens is that McClellan organizes the army and moves it here to Virginia. But he doesn't. He doesn't actually move against Richmond. He does, but what's going to happen is that there's going to be a new leader of the confederate troops. His name is, as I mentioned, Robert E. Lee. And Robert E. Lee has dug a series of trenches around Richmond and Petersburg. We think of trench warfare. What do we usually think about? What war? World War one. Exactly. But they got the idea from Lee. All right? So at any rate, McClellan doesn't know how many troops Lee has, although he. The reality is he has many more troops than Lee. Okay? So he will keep telling, you'll kind of camp out here and he'll keep telling Lincoln, I need more troops. I need more troops, because he doesn't know how many troops Lee has. And eventually Lincoln will realize that McClellan has no intention of taking Richmond and he'll withdraw McClellan from Virginia back to Washington. Right? So that's called the peninsular campaign, and it's going to be seen as another defeat for. For the Union. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Okay, so now the result of that is that Lincoln is going to say, I don't like this guy McClellan because he's not winning battles. He's too timid. Right? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, now let's move to the west. In the west, there's going to be a battle at a place called Shiloh. The thing that the guy who was leading the Union army at Shiloh was Ulysses Grant. Okay? Ulysses Grant had been in the army during the mexican war. He stayed in the army after the Mexican War and was stationed in California. But he was a drunk and he eventually drank his way out of the army and he moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Had a grocery store there. And then when the Civil War started, he signed up as a mustering officer. Okay? But through a series of battlefield promotions, he ends up in command of the army, Shiloh, in early 1862. Okay? And he's going to win the battle of Shiloh. And one of the things that will characterize him is that he will only accept unconditional surrender. So Lincoln will notice that. And Lincoln will start to really follow the career of Ulysses Grant while he's losing faith in his generals from. In Washington. Right? And so we'll just leave it at that for now and again, keep in mind this happened in the west, so it wasn't something that people in the east knew a lot about or felt close to. Okay, questions, comments about this. All right, next. Later that same year, Lee has a plan, and he's. Oops, I keep doing that. I'm sorry. The. Lee's plan is to invade the north. His idea is that if you march across. If you march across Maryland and you march into Pennsylvania and you get to Harrisburg, this thing here. Harrisburg. Right. That's where the railhead is. That connects the west to the east. And if you could cut the railhead in Harrisburg, that would cripple the Union army because they would not be able to get supplies from the west. Okay. And so his plan then is to cross over what's known as Antietam Creek at a place called Sharpsburg, which is. Sorry, I got this thing in the middle of my screen here. Sharpsburg is right there. Okay. His plan is to cross into across Antietam Creek at Sharpsburg and then march across Maryland and into Pennsylvania. What happens is that in those days when you were giving orders to your subordinate officers, obviously you couldn't use any kind of secure communications or emails or radio or anything like that, so you had to write down your orders, and somebody would actually physically carry them to where they were supposed to go to. Right. And so he wrote down his orders for his generals at his plan to cross at Sharpsburg, or as the union will call the Antietam Creek. Right. And the person, the messenger who was carrying the orders, dropped them on the road, and a union sympathizer picked them up. And so by the time he got. By the time Lee tried to cross the creek, to cross the river at Antietam Creek, McClellan already knew what his plan was, and he was able to defeat him. Right? So Antietam becomes the very first major victory of the Union army. Okay? And then after the battle of Antietam, Lincoln says to McClellan, go get Lee. Lee had to withdraw back into Virginia. And Lincoln says, go get him. And McClellan refused. He said, I can't go because my army's been too defeated. Right. And so then McClellan is fired. Okay. And they replace him with a man named Ambrose Burnside. Oh, yeah. Okay. They replace him with a man named Ambrose Burnside. This, let me show you here. This is Burnside. And the thing that we can that kind of cements this place in history is his facial hair, which became known as sideburns because of who he was. Right? Okay? So sideburns come from Burnside. Okay, I keep going the wrong direction here. Alright? So at any rate, Burnside will be in control of the army at a major battle at a place called Fredericksburg in Virginia, where his army is going to be slaughtered. He basically orders them against an impregnable confederate position in the middle of winter. And so he loses many men and he's fired. He's replaced with a guy named Joseph Hooker. All right? Now what we can remember about Joseph Hooker was that one of the ways that Hooker was able to keep his army intact, because in those days, men would just leave the army. They would just get up in the middle of the night and go because they. Because they were homesick or whatever, right? And so what Joseph Hooker did was he brought in ladies of the night, okay? And these ladies became known as Hooker's girls, okay? And so that's where we get to name Hooker. So I'm not sure that's what I'd like to be remembered for, but that's where our term for prostitutes come from, is from Hooker, Joseph Hooker. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Well, Hooker was in control of the army at another battle at Chancellorsville. This is probably, I think, the high water of the, of the confederate power because the Confederates are going to actually win this battle. But one of the things that happens during the battle is that Jackson, Stonewall Jackson, who is Lee's right hand man, is going to be killed. And what that does is it really weakens the Confederate a team. We talked about the a team before, right? So, so now the. The Confederate a team is weakened, even though the. The. He's still facing the b team in the east. All right? So. So then Hooker is fired. And then they put another general in charge, George Gordon Meade. And this is in the summer of 1863. Lee decides to try his invasion of the north again. Right? Now, one of the things I want you guys to notice here is that the confederate troops didn't have shoes, right? They marched on in bare feet, if you can believe it, okay? Because the confederacy was poor. Okay? So. So when Lee crossed into Pennsylvania. Oops, I've got the wrong one here. When Lee crossed into Pennsylvania, he knew that there was a shoe factory, a little town called Gettysburg. So he took his army to Gettysburg to get shoes for his army. And because of some, I guess you could say, intelligence mix ups, he ends up being trapped at Gettysburg by the Union army. Okay? And what follows then, is going to be a three day battle. You guys have probably all heard of the battle of Gettysburg, right? And the outcome of the battle going to be that Lee's army is destroyed. Lee can no longer fight an offensive war, and he's forced to withdraw back into Virginia. And from that point on, Lee will be fighting a defensive war against the Union troops. All right, you guys with me? Questions, comments about this. Now, at the same time, there's going to be another victory in the west. I don't. This. Maybe you can see it here. The thing that had happened in the west was that Louisiana had been restored to the Union very early in the war, but the United States couldn't control the Mississippi because there was a. There was a confederate fortification at a place called Vicksburg in Mississippi. And so in order to be able to open up the Mississippi River, Grant, General Grant, came up with a plan to take Vicksburg. The problem with taking Vicksburg was that there was an enormous confederate army to the east of Vicksburg. And most people thought that the only way to get to Vicksburg was to come in from the east, right somewhere over here. But what Grant does is he decides to cross the river and march without supplies through Arkansas and Louisiana and then recross the river south of Vicksburg and attack it from the east between the confederate army and Vicksburg. And that's going to be a winning strategy. So on the same day that the United States wins or that the Union wins the battle of Gettysburg, they also win the battle of Vicksburg. Okay. And the outcome of this is going to be that Lincoln will decide that he should put Grant in charge of all the armies. Okay? So Lincoln decides to make Grant the first general of all of the Union armies because he has a record of winning. He's not afraid. Right? Now, keep in mind that I told you before that Grant had been cashier from the army because he was a drunk. Okay? And there is some. Some evidence that he was a drunk even during the civil war, although he was. He was able to stay sober for most of it, right? But the. The. One of the. Probably the premier historian about the civil war conjectures that the reason why Grant was so successful was because he was a drunk. Because he was known as a drunk. He had a reputation as a drunk. And because of that, he knew that he was never going to have a political career. Nobody would ever want him to be in politics, because everybody knew he was a drunk. You guys get what I'm saying? So. So when Lincoln decides to make grant the general of all the armies, the other generals in the. In the east, the political generals, are going to say, well, you know, he drinks. Right? And. And Lincoln is going to say, well, find out what he's drinking and give a case to all my other generals. Right? And so anyway, that's just kind of an interesting story. Now, here's the difference between Grant and the rest of the political generals, let's say. Okay? And the difference is that where the other generals would attack, lose, and then retreat, Grant would attack, lose, but keep advancing. Right. The reason why is he knew that even though he was losing battles, he was going to win the war because he could replace his losses, and the south could not replace their losses. You guys are following me here. All right, so there's this, what they call the Petersburg campaign, where Grant attacks, loses a battle, then attacks again, then loses a battle, then attacks again and loses a battle and attacks again and loses battle. But what ends up happening is that he places a siege around Petersburg, and his siege goes from 1864 into the spring of 1865 with the trenches to. Remember, I told you about the trenches. Okay? And as the siege goes on, Grant keeps adding more and more and more troops, and Lee keeps losing more and more and more troops because they're deserting or they're getting killed and they can't be replaced. And so by the end of the siege, there's only one confederate soldier every 50ft along the trench lines, and most of them are either 13 year old boys or 60 year old men. Right. You guys are with me. And so what's going to. What's going to happen is that Lee will eventually realize that he's not going to be able to win militarily. And so he will decide to retreat. And his plan is to retreat and to actually to wage a guerrilla warfare. Right. The idea being that they can't win a conventional war because the Union army is now too big, too powerful, so they're going to fight a guerrilla warfare. So what happens is that Lee flees, essentially, from Petersburg. The Union takes Richmond and Petersburg. And eventually what ends up happening is that Lee is surrounded at a little town called Appomattox courthouse. Okay? And then it's going. He's going to realize, I mean, on the last, really, the last day, he orders his cavalry to attack the Union army. And when they go over the hill to attack, they see a sea of blue uniforms, essentially. Right? There's Lee has about 25,000 men, and the Union army is about 100,000 men. Okay. And they're going to realize they can't win. So Lee will be convinced that he needs to surrender. Right. He receives a he receives a letter from Grant, and he responds to letters saying, well, I'll meet. I'll meet with you at this place called Appomattox Courthouse. Right. And when they. What happens is that he. He sends somebody into Appomattox courthouse to find a place for them to meet, and he runs into a guy. The guy who sent. Runs into a guy walking down the street. His name is Wilmer McLean. Okay. Or McLean. I'm not sure how to pronounce it, but if you guys will remember the very first. What was the very first battle that we talked about? Bull run. Was it the Boston tea party? No, I mean the one about the civil war. Right. Was the very first battle of the Civil War was that we talked about Bull Run. Bull run. Okay. And remember where you do remember who the confederate general was there? Pierre Gustave, toutant Beauregard. And where did he have his headquarters? Remember I told you that he had his headquarters in something of a local farmer. The outdoor. The kitchen. The kitchen, exactly. All right, so Beauregard's headquarters was in the outdoor kitchen. The guy who owned the farm was named Wilmer McLean. And Wilmer McLean decides, after the battle of Bull run, he doesn't want to be in a war zone, so he picks up everything and moves to a little town called Appomattox Courthouse. And then on this morning in April of 1865, he meets somebody from Lee's army, who convinces him, reluctantly, to allow the meeting between Grant and Lee in his parlor. Right. And so Grant and Lee then meet in the parlor. Wilmer McLean. I think I have a. Yeah, this painting here, this is the meeting between Grant and Lee, and Lee surrenders the confederate army. And that's going to be essentially the end of the war. It's going to keep going on a little bit longer, but. But that's essentially the end, because Lee, essentially, by this time, is the Confederacy. Right. And so from then on, Wilmer McLean could say that the civil war started in his kitchen and ended in his parlor. And that's a true story, folks."

","All right. So now let's talk about Vietnam. All right. Vietnam. At the beginning of the war in Vietnam, pretty much everybody in the United States was for it because Americans still thought about their role in the world as being the bastion of liberty, the protector of liberty, protector of democracy in the world. Right. And the war in Vietnam had come to be defined by Americans as a war against communism. Now in the documents that you guys are reading, you realize that from the point of view of people who lived in Vietnam, it really wasn't about communism or for many of them, wasn't about communism. It was about land reform and colonialism. But nevertheless, Americans believed it was about communism. And so Americans were very much in favor of intervening in Vietnam. But after a couple of years, people come to realize that what they're doing in Vietnam isn't defending democracy, that what they're doing in Vietnam is actually waging war against poor farmers, essentially. Right. And so, and particularly because there's a draft, which means that if you're over 18, the ability that you could be called up to go and fight in this war in Vietnam is very real. Many young people in the country are going to be very much against the war in Vietnam. Many young people in the country are going to believe that the war in Vietnam is an unjust war. The United States shouldn't be in it, and I don't want to be involved in it. Right. And this was true. I mean, if you think about, you have to imagine, right? What if when you guys graduated from high school, which for many of you wasn't very long ago, right. The, the first, the possibility that, that you were faced with was that you would have to go, you would be drafted into the army and you would have to go to Afghanistan and serve in Afghanistan for a couple years before you could, before you could go on with your life, if all I'm saying, you have to imagine, how would you feel about that, right. And there's a range of feelings, obviously, as you guys were reading about in your documents, for the most part, young people were like, I don't want people, I don't want that decision made for me, particularly when I don't agree with the war at all. And so what happens then is that there develops this known, what's known as a generation gap, right. The generation gap is between the young people against the war and the older people, the world war two generation, who are in favor of the war, and they're saying, look, we did our part during World War two to go and defend liberty in the world. Now it's your turn. And the kids are saying, no, we don't want to go over there. We're not. That's not our war. Nothing to do with us. It's not about the same thing. And so the generation looks at the younger generation as a bunch of almost like traitors, right? They're weak, soft, pinko, and, you know, the long hair and hippies and. And all that stuff. You know, the kind of billion of youth. And keep in mind that this is the baby boom generation, right? So there's. At one point, there were actually more people in the country younger than 15, and there were older than 15, okay? And so this is a big divide. And the people start to look at the old people as enemies, and the old people start to look at the young people as enemies, right? There were places in the south, for example, where hippies who would travel around volkswagen buses would drive through a town somewhere in Mississippi or something like that, and it would be in the newspaper. There was a busload of hippies that had gone through town last week, right? Like they were. Like they were a different species or something. You know what I'm saying? And so, at any rate, this creates. This is another area where there's a division. Division between young and old, okay? And then the way that the war in Vietnam actually was fought because of the draft, the way that the draft worked was that if you were enrolled in college, you wouldn't be drafted. You would get a different. Okay? And so was as long as you get into college, then you would. You wouldn't have to worry about being drafted. You see? I'm saying. But you have to be in college, right? Once you got into college, then you would never have to worry about. You wouldn't have to be worried about being drafted. And if you like, would stay in college for three years as a. As an english major, and then after three years declaring your major to be biology, then you have to basically start all over again, right? You could stay in college for decades. Right? So. And many people did. Okay? So what that left was that the people who couldn't afford college were the ones who were called up at a greater rate. So. And those poorer people to be minorities. All right? So it's not. They were not all minorities. There were some. There were a lot of poor white people, too, right? But what ended up happening was that the demographics of the people who fought in the war in Vietnam didn't represent the demographics of the United States because the demographics in Vietnam were a majority of minorities and a minority of whites. You guys get what I'm saying? So this becomes an issue of class and also an issue of race. Okay. So you guys could see in the, in the video where they were talking about the black people, it was people from Detroit that would end up going to Vietnam. Right. And people from the suburbs that would end up going to college. And so it becomes not just an issue of poor versus rich, but also an issue of black versus white or minority versus majority. You guys, what I'm saying here. All right, so this is another division in american society. So when we get to the end of the 1960s, by the time we get to 1968, the United States is essentially tearing itself apart internally. And I think, hopefully, when you guys watched that video, you were able to kind of get a feeling for the divisions in the United States at the time."

","And the divide spills over from the issue, from the, from the, from the concept of the role of the federal government into the private lives, private morality of people. And this is because of something called judicial activism. The Supreme Court during the 1960s was what they call an activist court. Okay. Judicial activism is the idea that, well, first off, let me just ask you guys, what is the purpose of the federal court? What is the purpose of the judicial branch? To interpret the laws. To interpret them. Right. Okay, so when you say interpret, what does that mean? What would be a valid law? Like the right to bear arms right now that's constantly under. Okay. That's what they're arguing about. But what would make the law valid, unconstitutional, or if it's constitutional or not? Yeah, if it's constitutional or not. Right. What the, what an activist court does is it broadens the definition of what's constitutional by saying, well, it's constitutional, even though it doesn't exactly say in the constitution this, we can understand it to mean this because of that. Right. And so there's going to be a disconnect, then, between people who see the Constitution as something that should be interpreted strictly and those who see the Constitution as something that can be interpreted more broadly. Right. This is a long time controversy in american constitutional law. Going all the way back to the beginning is the Constitution. They have what they call strict and loose constructionist right. A strict constructionist is somebody who says that the federal government should only be able to do what the Constitution says, and the Constitution only says what it says. And a loose constructionist will say, well, the Constitution grants for different interpretations because of the necessary and proper clause. And so therefore, we can broaden the meaning of the Constitution based on current needs. Right? So those are the two different kind of constitutional strategies or our outlooks. And in today's court, for example, most of the justices are strict constructionists. The more conservative justices would be the strict constructionists, and the more liberal justices would be the more the loose constructionist right. Just so we can kind of leave it there. Okay, so, but what happens is that during the 1960s, the, the court was more dominated by loose constructionists, which meant that they interpreted the constitution more broadly. All right? And so in a couple of different cases, I can give you an example. They make decisions that look like they're actually making law, right? They call it. They call it legislating from the bench. Okay. Rather than just interpreting the law, they're actually making law. That's what people say. And generally, the court will be accused of making law whenever they make a decision that goes against what you believe. Right? So if you think that the court should decide one way and they actually decide a different way, then you'll say, well, they're just. They're just legislating from the bench. Right. But if you agree with them, then you say, well, that's a valid interpretation. You guys get what I'm saying? So when we say that a court is an activist court or that they're legislating from the bench, you have to understand that that's really point of view. Okay. At any rate, the point here, I can give you a couple of examples. One has to do with criminal rights, and that's the Miranda case, Miranda versus Arizona. Right. Where a man named Miranda was actually convicted of crime. He. He confessed to the crime, but because he wasn't told that he could have a lawyer before he confessed, they appealed it through to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said they had to overturn the conviction because he wasn't told about his rights, which is what leads to what we call the Miranda rights. So if you guys ever watch cop shows, or hopefully not, but if you've ever been arrested, you'll hear the cops always say, you have the right to be silent. You have to write to attorney, that sort of thing. Right. Okay, so that's going to be one example. Then there's other examples that go into social issues. One of them actually ends up being a First Amendment case that was a porn shop owner that was told he couldn't open a porn shop in a certain location. And he argued, he appealed that through the Supreme Court. And Supreme Court said that the First Amendment said he could have the shop. Right. And then there were other ones, like laws that prevented interracial marriage between blacks and whites, where those cases were challenged all the way up through the courts. And the courts eventually said that. That there was no. That it was unconstitutional to prevent interracial marriage. And then there was another one where somebody who they used to actually, when I was in school, every morning, there would be a prayer, somebody would lead a prayer over the intercom. Right. And there was somebody who sued saying that they didn't want to be led in a prayer. And that went all the way to the Supreme Court. Supreme court said that the school can't lead people in prayer. Okay. It doesn't say you can't have prayer in school. Everybody knows there's prayer in school whenever test time comes along. Right. But it says that the school can't lead you in that prayer because the school is a government entity so for example, if nobody, like if I was a professor, I'm not going to do this, but if I was a professor and I tried to lead you guys in a prayer, that would be unconstitutional because Mesa College is a government entity. But if I was a professor at USD, which is a catholic college, and I said I was going to lead you in a prayer, I could do it because it's not a government entity. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about that? All right. Okay. So at any rate, now let's take a look at this from the point of view of the liberals. We'll say, okay, well, the liberals say you have to be informed of your rights. The liberals say you have a right to say pretty much whatever you want. The liberals say you can marry whoever you want. And the liberals say you have to keep your private religion out of the school. The state shouldn't be teaching religion or practicing religion. Okay? But from the conservative point of view, what we're seeing is that the court is overturning convictions on a technicality. Right, technicality meaning that they didn't read him his rights. Okay. And the court is acting in favor of pornographers and atheists. And these actions are seen as a real challenge to the traditional way of what does it mean to be an American? You follow what I'm saying? So this is the divide. This is the divide between the liberals and the conservatives. And this is not a divide that can be bridged. There's no common ground here. You follow what I'm saying? This makes sense to you guys. All right, so, so that's how we end up with this, with this divided country between liberal and conservative."

","Brown versus board of education, said that segregation laws were unequal or were unconstitutional, but there was no way to enforce that except by the court. All right, so in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1956, actually. Yeah, 1955 is actually when it happened. That was the year I was born, by the way. So at any rate, the point. Meet me and Disneyland both in 1955. But there was an NAACP chapter in Montgomery, and there was a woman who was the secretary of the local NAACP chapter named Rosa Parks, who. You guys, if you go to the campus, you can see there's kind of a monument to Rosa Parks right at the entrance. They're coming from the armory. But at any rate, the. She was also a seamstress at a local department store. And when she left work one afternoon, she got on the bus and sat down. The law in Montgomery said that the black people had to sit behind white people. So a black person, if the bus was empty, the black person could sit wherever they wanted. But if white people got on, they had to move to the back of the bus so that the white people could sit in front of them. You guys follow me here. And so what happened on this one day was that Rosa park sat near the front of the bus, and enough white people got on that she was asked, not asked, but ordered to move to the back of the bus, and she refused. And so she was arrested and convicted for breaking this segregation ordinance. Right. You guys are with me. Questions. And again, there's some question about whether or not that was a test case, but it becomes a test case, because what happens is that that law is actually appealed. That conviction is actually appealed until the federal courts overturn the conviction and also overturn the law. Right. You guys with me? So that actually ends up working. But there's something different that happens in Montgomery. And what it is is that the people of Montgomery, the black people in Montgomery, decide not to just try this case in the law, but to also respond to the law with mass resistance, I guess you could say. Right, or non cooperation. And so they establish a boycott. The boycott of the bus system essentially says black people are not going to ride the bus until the law has changed, which is, you know, it's actually, there's two ways to think about this. In one hand, it probably has some financial impact on the bus system, because black riders were probably the majority of the bus system riders. But it also is a challenge to the culture of the south, because the suggestion that black people and white people are equal is offensive to most whites in the south at this time. Right. And so when you challenge that inequality. Your challenging, your deeply behead, deeply held ontological outlook of the white society. And they're going to respond with violence, which is what they do. Right? And so when this boycott goes into place, they ask for the support of a local preacher at one of the more successful and prosperous black churches in Montgomery, the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. And his name is Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King Junior. And he reluctantly decides to take a leadership role in this boycott. But there's a difference between, or I should say it this way, King brought to the scene a very different strategy than had been used by black people up to this point. And where he gets this strategy really begins in the 1840s in the United States with a man named Henry David Thoreau. You probably have heard of Thoreau. You may or may not know anything that he wrote, but one thing that he wrote was a pamphlet called civil disobedience. And the pamphlet, civil disobedience was a reflection on an experience that he had had, which was that he refused to pay his poll tax on the grounds that paying a tax to a government that was immoral, was immoral. And he felt that the government of Massachusetts was immoral because it supported slavery in the United States and it supported the mexican american war. So he refused to pay his poll tax and was put in jail. And then the next morning, his mom came and bailed him out. Okay. And so his. His sacrifice wasn't exactly great, but he does write this pamphlet, which is going to have a great impact later, called civil disobedience. And the basic idea behind civil disobedience is that it is immoral to follow an immoral law. But if you're going to break the law and not fall, if you're going to challenge the law, you have to do it openly. You can't just say, well, I don't agree with the government, so I'm not going to pay my tax, and I hope they don't catch me. Right. You have to say, I'm not going to pay this tax. Right. And this strategy is actually adopted by a man in India named Mohandas Gandhi. You probably have heard of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma is actually a kind of honorific. It means great soul. But his name was Mohandas Gandhi, and he adopted Thoreau's strategy of nonviolent non cooperation. And basically what he said was that british rule over India was immoral, and so therefore, the people of India should not cooperate with the british government. And he ended up spending most many years of his life in jail because of it. Right. But the main kind of point behind his strategy was to be nonviolent, which is what Thoreau had actually called for. Right. And the reason why that's important is because if you are challenged, if somebody is violent towards you, it's a natural reaction to respond with violence. And that's what happens in all rebellions, right? If the British were violent against the american colonists, the colonists responded with violence, right? You see what I'm saying? And they felt justified in doing it. But Gandhi's strategy, Thoreau's strategy was that if you're violent toward me and I don't respond with violence, then what that does is it demonstrates the immorality of your law. If you have to use violence against me to enforce your law, then that means your law is immoral. And if I respond with nonviolence and take the blows, then that will demonstrate the immorality of your law. You follow me here. So, so the idea here then is that rather than responding with violence, I'm going to refuse to respond with violence and I'm going to allow you to be violent against me. And the result of that is that you and everybody else will understand the, the immorality of your law. Okay, well, that is a great idea, but it only works if it's done in the open, right? So if, you know, we're in secret and somebody isn't, we're in the back room in the jail and they say, you're either going to do what I tell you or I'm going to kill you. And you say, okay, kill me. Well, you're dead, but nobody saw it, so who's going to know? You see what I'm saying? But if it's done in the public square, if everybody can see it and it ends up on the news, then that's a different story, isn't it? Because people say, you just shot that guy for doing nothing, right? I mean, we see that all the time, don't we? Right? So, so, I mean, it's kind of like the meme that they have now. It's like, you know, walking while black and sleeping while black and doing these different things, right? Because there's people that are violent against them even though they're really not provoking it, right? But in this case, they were provoking it. So the strategy that Martin Luther came up with was, well, instead of just sitting around here waiting for them to be violent, we're going to provoke them into violence. We're going to go out in the streets and we're going to march and we're going to say, this is wrong. And we're going to invite the press. We want the whole press to come down here and watch what happens. And they do, right? So the press comes to Montgomery to watch what's happening. And when the black people go out and march, you see people using fire hoses, the police using fire hoses against the people to break up the march. And you see snarling dogs against little kids, right? And people all over the country are watching this and say, what's going on down there? What's happening down there, right? And remember how we talked about ontology? And how does. What's ontological change? What's ontological changes when you're forced to see it, when you're forced to. When there's a crisis in what you believe, right? And at this point, what we see happening is people in America start to see the issue of Jim Crow as really violent, as really immoral. You follow what I'm saying here? And the result of that then, is going to be that eventually that will be reflected in the people's representatives in government, right? So even though we can see that the strategy of test cases was successful in changing individual laws, it was unsuccessful in challenging Jim Crow as an institution. And even though the strategy employed by Martin Luther King was ineffective in changing the law, it did challenge Jim Crow in such a way that Jim Crow comes to be seen as evil by the people. And eventually that leads to leadership in the national government that will institute changes, that will bring about the end that the civil rights movement started with. If you remember going back here all the way back to the 1870s. What do we want? We want civic equality and political rights. Now, in 1960, 419 65, we get the Civil Rights act of 1964, which basically nullifies all Jim Crow laws everywhere, right? And we have the Voting Rights act of 1965, which removes barriers to voting. Okay? One of the ways that black people in the south had been, or actually not just in the south, but in other places, had been disenfranchised, was by erecting barriers to voting, like poll taxes and literacy tests and things like that. And the result was that the white population was able to keep strong control over the political system. But when the Voting Rights act overturned all of those restrictions and black people could register and vote, that made huge changes in politics around the country. Okay, now, so we'll just leave it there for a second and let's stop and think now, right, that, well, the Civil Rights act of 1964 mandates and enforces legal equality, civic equality for black people, for everybody, really. And the voting rights of. Act of 1965 provides. Removes barriers to the franchise for everybody. You guys follow? So we could say, well, this is. This is a. This is a great victory, and it is okay. Because this is going to really be the catalyst for the changes to come after it. Right. But. And so if you were to actually look at. If you were to buy a book about civil rights movement, generally speaking, right, or you watch a video on tv, there was a great PBS documentary. I can't remember the name of it now. Eyes on the prize, I think was the name of it. But at any rate, the point of it is that they started in 1954 and they end in 1965, right? So we would say, oh, the civil rights movement was 1954 to 19, 1965, right. But in fact, the civil rights movement started at the very beginning of Jim Crow, and it continues today. Okay? And even though 1964 and 1965 were a great turning point, it didn't end race division in the United States, as you all know. I mean, I don't have to tell you this. Right? Okay. And the reason why is because there's going to be an enormous reaction to it, right. So if you think, okay, well, the Civil Rights act ended civic inequality and the Voting Rights act made it possible for everybody to vote. So we're all happy now, no more racism, you know, and even going further, we can say, well, look, we've got a black president. We're obviously not racist. Right. You follow what I'm saying here? Right. But the reality is, after the Civil Rights act and after the Voting Rights act, race relations got worse. They didn't get better, but not for a long time. And. And really what ended up happening was there was a struggle for over race until into the 1970s, and then we all kind of just forgot about it. It's like, okay, well, I guess we're over racism now. You know what I'm saying? And. And so then we can see today there are some struggles continuing. For example, the Voting Rights act of 1965 took away the barriers to voting. One of the ways that they did that was that they wouldn't allow different states to enact voting laws without approval by the United States government. Well, the problem, of course, with that is that it violates the 14th amendment, okay? And that was overturned in, like, I think, 2012 or something like that, whatever. But the first thing that happened after that was then that these different states start passing laws restricting voting rights. Okay? So you see states like Texas and Georgia and South Carolina, not South Carolina, North Carolina, and even northern states, I remember, I think Michigan, Ohio, are passing laws that the effect of the law is to restrict access to the ballot box for minorities. You follow? I'm saying. So this struggle we may have made, we may have had a great victory in the. In the Voting Rights act of 1965, but the struggle goes on. Do you follow? I'm saying. And the same thing with civil rights. Okay, so, I mean, one of. I think one of the most basic civil rights is the right to live. Do you follow what I'm saying here? One of the most basic civil rights is the right to live. And yet we have been able to see for decades that policemen can kill black people with no, no consequence. Doubt, right? That's the whole issue behind Black Lives Matter, right? It's not that black lives matter more than other lives. It means that they matter at all, because up until today, the statistics say that black lives don't matter if I'm saying. Okay, so when we look at this sea change that happened in american public opinion between 1954 and 1965, can you describe that to me? You better be able to, because I just told you less than half an hour ago, you said the change in. Sorry, was that the change in american public opinion between 1954 and 1965? People looked at Jim Crow in 1954. What did they see? Well, I mean, white people saw Jim Crow and they thought it was fine, obviously. But then after the changes, everything still was the same, if not worse, in terms of public opinion. Race relations got worse. Okay, but here's. Okay, I'm glad I brought this up because I want to make sure that we're straight on this. Okay? In 1954, everybody knew that Jim Crow was there. Most people didn't think about it. Okay, so, like, if you lived in the south, you were invested in enforcing Jim Crow. Or if you lived in a place where Jim Crow was. Was part of the culture, then you were invested in enforcing it. If you were elsewhere, if you were in Los Angeles or in Denver or someplace like that, you didn't care. I mean, you knew it was there, and you probably knew it was wrong, but you didn't really think about it. You know, it was just like, that's their problem, not mine. I don't deal with that. Right. And so you didn't have any kind of personal investment in it, even ideologically. Right. But when you start watching on tv, you know, churches being blown up and little kids being killed. Right. And little kids being attacked on tv with snarling dogs. Right, by policemen or people being beat up on the Pettis Bridge for just trying to register to vote, then you're going to start to say, well, you know, this is wrong. This is not what we stand for. You see what I'm saying? And so what we see happening is this sea change in attitude between 1954 and 1965, where before 1964, most people didn't even think about Jim Crow. And by 1965, most people thought it was evil. Right? You see what I'm saying here? Now, not everybody, obviously, a lot of people. Some people are still in favor of Jim Crow, okay? And they're more vocal now than they have been for some time. But at any rate, can you think of anything that might be happening right now that demonstrates that same kind of a sea change in public attitude? I guess you could maybe use the George Floyd incident as an example, right? We didn't really, I mean, there wasn't as much protest going on before the incident. And that's when that moment kind of, kind of changed the point of view of Americans and made more protest apparent. Okay, let's think of. You're on to something there. Let me just, let's go back a few years, and I don't know how much of this you guys remember, but after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, there were, there were enormous. Well, there were protests in Ferguson and they turned riot. They turned violent, they turned into riots. Right? Okay. And coming out of that, most people came to think of the Black Lives Matter movement as being a bunch of thugs, a bunch of terrorists. Right? Does that sound right? You guys are with me on that. Yeah, I remember he was talking about Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Yeah. A few years back. I remember. And whenever black lives, they blamed all the riots on Black Lives Matter. Right? Which you can argue about that. And I'm not going to get into the details of it right now, but the main thing is to see the public opinion is, oh, those guys are a bunch of troublemakers. Right? They want things that they can't have. Okay. That sort of thing. And if you looked at that extra credit that I gave you, the video about the Black Lives Matter group and the Trump group and how, you know, the Trump group thought the Black Lives Matter group were a bunch of terrorists, essentially. Right? You guys follow me here. And what happened was that they kept, they were consistent and they were tenacious about their demand. What's the basic demand of the Black Lives Matter movement? What are they mostly against? Or I say, what are they for? Racial justice, racial equality. Okay. But now the specific incident that brought Black Lives Matter into existence was Trayvon Martin. So what was the, what's the specific issue involved there? Police brutality. Police brutality. All right. One of the things that you'll notice on the movie that you guys are going to be watching this weekend is that they're actually, the riots in Detroit were started by, and were motivated by the idea of police brutality. This happens in 1967, right? So now in 2018, we're still rioting. We're still protesting police brutality. Did we make any changes to police brutality by or police accountability because of these riots? No. Right? But think about now. After George Floyd, we saw people all over the country, in fact, all over the world, they're out there identifying with black lives Matter. You follow what I'm saying here? So we've seen this sea change in our own lifetimes, right? We've seen how public opinion can be brought to bear in favor of justice, right? In favor of what Meacham calls our better angels. We can see that this is happening. The struggle isn't over. It goes on. You follow what I'm saying? We'll make some progress, and then we'll actually change the subject and we'll have to go back to it again. This is the way history works. All right? But at any rate, so when you say the reason why I did this lecture really wasn't so that I could harangue you guys about Black lives Matter, but it was because I wanted to demonstrate the difference between, or the difference in the strategies of the NAACP and what becomes known as the civil rights movement or Southern Christian Leadership conference. One of them is based on litigation, which can change the law but not change people's minds. And one of them is based on mass protest, which can't change the law, but does change people's minds, which eventually does change the law."

","But let's talk about what was going on in Europe at the same time. Okay? And one of the things that had happened, as you guys recall, was that the French and the British wanted to make the treaty of Versailles, a punitive treaty that would cripple Germany and make sure that Germany never threatened Britain and France again. Okay? And so one of the ways that they did that was by imposing reparations, as we talked about last week. But another way was that they actually divided Germany up. Germany had really only been unified since about 1870. And after World War one, they broke it up again, and they really cut Germany in two and created the country of Poland, which really hadn't before that existed for 1000 years. Right? But now they create this new country called Poland that divides Germany up, and then they create a whole bunch of new countries out of the old austro hungarian empire. So there's, you know, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Romania, Serbia, all these different countries. Right? And so what that did was it weakened Germany, all right? It weakened them particularly economically, because the reparations are going to place a terrible strain on the german economy. And the way that the german economy or the german government essentially is going to respond to that is going to be by printing money. And the problem, of course, with printing money is that the money eventually has no value because there's nothing backing it up. It's just a bunch of paper. Right. So the people in Germany were really threatening, and this is in the middle of the Great Depression. So everybody's suffering from the Great Depression, but because the government that took over in Germany when the Kaiser abdicated was a. Was a republic. But many of the people in the government were actually jewish. And so the sentiment arose in Germany that the Jews had sold out the country, that they had made a deal with the west, and they'd surrendered, even though Germany actually could have won the war. That was the thinking. It wasn't true, really. None of it was true. Right? But that was the thinking. And where that thinking came from was from a guy named Adolf Hitler, who wrote a book called Mein Kampf, which means my struggle. Right. And in the book, what he said was that Germany had been sold out by the Jews, but that the german race was the master race of the world. His view was a racist view, which was at the top of the kind of racial food chain, essentially was the german race. And then after that, there were gradations of greatness, I guess you could say, until you get to the bottom. Right. And so what they thought was that Germans were actually the superior race. And then other Scandinavians were just underneath that. And then the british Anglo Saxons were underneath that. And then if you get down, like, the Americans were way down there because there were people in America from all over the place. Right? And then when you got into other colored people, other ethnicities, they were even further down. Right. Eastern Europeans were down close to the bottom. They were called intermention, meaning under people, essentially. Right. And of course, you know, black people or Asians are even further down. But then at the bottom, the greatest enemy was, guess the who? The Jews of, right? Okay? So the idea that Hitler had was that once he took power or his party, the nazi party took power in Germany, that they would first unite all the german people into one country, which we call greater Germany or the Third Reich, right? And then once he had done that, then he would turn his attention to eastern Europe, with the idea being that because eastern Europe is occupied by untermenschen, they don't really deserve to control that country. And so the Germans should take it over as a place where they can expand, called lebensraum, or living space. Right? The idea that they can expand into the east and there's good agricultural country and there's oil, and so they can expand their greater Germany. And anybody that's in their way should just be exterminated, because they don't. They're not. They're not worth anything. You guys follow what I'm saying? And he said all this right out loud in his book, okay? And people bought it. People in Germany who are suffering are all of a sudden saying, well, hey, wait a minute. Maybe he's right. Maybe these Jews are the real problem, right? Because it gives them somewhere to focus their anxiety. All right? Now, the thing that we should add to this discussion is that Hitler didn't invade, invent anti semitism, antisemitism had been a european cultural artifact going all the way back to the roman empire, okay? But what Hitler did was he weaponized it. He was able to organize this. This anti semitic feeling in order to be able to gain his own political power, right? And so one of the things that I would like to. To caution you guys about is that if you see a politician. And it doesn't have to be a foreign politician, but if you see any politician that starts to. What starts his rise to political power by defining some group as the enemy, whether it's Japanese or whether it's Chinese or whether it's Hispanics or Muslims, right? That person is weaponizing our own worst racist instincts. You guys follow what I'm saying, and the purpose of that is to. Is to seize power. Because the idea behind that is that, well, if you give me the power, I'm the strong man and I can solve this problem. Right. You guys get what I'm saying? So this is how authoritarianism starts. And this is exactly what happened in Germany. It also happened in. In Italy, but not on the same scale. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? I heard that in the US it was very hard to put propaganda towards because I know in Germany it was like very common knowledge that they were very anti semitic, but most people didn't really find that that surprising because most of the country generally had, like, an anti semitic view. So when it came to the propaganda, they focused more on, like, against the Japanese and stuff like that, rather than the Germans. Well, I mean, there was. There was actually an anti semitic strain in the United States at the time. Really? Based on. More on. I think based more on the immigration from Eastern Europe that had happened, like in 1910s and 1920s that we read about in the Meacham book. Right. But the idea was that what was happening in the United States was that the Jews were also considered the enemy because they were foreigners. Okay. Plus they were jewish. And, you know, the Jews killed Jesus. Right. That's also not historically accurate. But anyway, that was the thinking that people have. It's very simplistic thinking. But for example, there had been a ship of refugees from Germany that were Jewish that tried to get into the United States, and they weren't allowed in because they were jewish. You follow me here? So, yeah, there is an anti semitic strain in the United States. Roosevelt is going to actually use that racism as his argument not only against Japan, but also against Germany. Okay. Didn't we have japanese internment camps in America at the time? Yeah, we're not there yet, but we're going to get there. Right? Okay. Okay. All right, good. Any. Any other questions? So. So, you know, this. This racism that Hitler was able to weaponize doesn't just exist in Germany. It pretty much exists everywhere, and it exists here in the United States today. I just read this morning about. And you guys probably know about this, and this is awful, but there's been a lot of attacks against Asians, Asian Americans in the United States because people, without thinking very much are blaming COVID on Chinese. Right? They're saying, what was the Chinese that caused it? So let's kill some asian people. That's going to solve the problem. Right? It doesn't solve the problem. In fact, all it does is create disunion, it creates. It creates destruction. It doesn't actually create unity. But unlike that in Germany, because most of the people were white Europeans, they were able to create this racial. This feeling of racial unity. Even though the Orion nation that Hitler talked about, wrote about was a fiction, it didn't even exist, had never existed historically. His historical thinking was based on myth and fantasy, but nevertheless, people bought it because it sounded good to them. Right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, well, anyway, so what happens then is that eventually Hitler puts in place his plan. He does actually annex all of these different areas. The only thing that was left was Poland. And in September 1, 1939, he invaded Poland. He. Not personally, but the german army invaded Poland. And that was actually what eventually caused the British and the French to declare war. So they declared war in the fall of 1939, but the war didn't really start in earnest until the spring of 1940 when Hitler invaded France. Now why would they invade France? The reason why was the same as the reason why the Germans invaded France in World War one, which was that their idea was to knock France out of the war quickly so they could focus their efforts on eastern Europe. Okay, you guys are following here. So the plan was called the Schlieffen plan. The Germans had tried it in world War one but had failed. They hadn't actually been able to reach Paris in world War two. They succeeded. So they knocked France out of the war right off the bat. And then they started to turn their efforts to the east. And it's really going to be in the east where they end up losing the war. But that's a different story altogether. At any rate, the point is that very quickly, in 1940, all of Europe essentially is under the occupation or under the influence of the german empire. And so basically, England stands alone. England is the only country that's. That's really withstanding the german assault. And the biggest reason for that is because they couldn't send tanks across the English Channel. Okay? But so Churchill is. Churchill's the prime minister of England, and he's working very hard to try to get the United States involved in the war. Now keep in mind that we talked about with World War one, the United States and England or the British were enemies, really. But after World War one, there was this kind of sense of fraternity between the United States and the British. And Churchill calls upon that, right? So he's going to call upon Roosevelt to work for winning the war for the British or basically for the west. And Roosevelt will buy it because he sees Hitler and Mussolini as a threat to democracy. Okay. And so, so there's going to be a series of talks off the coast of Newfoundland called the ABC talks. And the ABC talks, America, British Canada and America, Britain, Canada. Essentially, at these talks, Roosevelt agreed. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed that if the United States ended up going to war with Japan, that the United States would go to war with Germany at the same time and that the Americans would fight the war in Europe before they fought the war in Asia. All right. It would focus on Europe first. And the reason why was because there was a threat to the Suez Canal, which was the link between the British and their empire in India. You guys follow me here. So, so essentially, what, what we see is already in place when Pearl harbor happens is this agreement that the United States is going to send troops to Europe."

","During the Middle Ages in Europe. We've already mentioned on another day that Europe was backwards politically and socially and economically from many other places in the world, including Asia. And so there wasn't a lot of trade. The trade that did happen happened over land. There was the Silk road, these kind of red roads here. Red lines were built by the Mongols. And what it did was it connected Europe with the riches of the east. The problem that the Europeans had was that they really didn't have anything to wasn't Europe didn't really have anything that the Asians wanted. And so the trade was minimal. And what trade that there was happened over land. Now, at the same time, there was a lucrative trade between East Asia and the east coast of Africa that was accomplished by muslim traders who know traded over water. Okay? So there's a trading network here that's an ancient and lucrative trading network, but it's not connected to the Europeans because Europeans essentially don't have anything to trade. In the 1450s, the king of Portugal will sponsor the discovery of a new technology that allows Europeans to sail away from land. Okay? Now, one of the problems that Europeans had was that they couldn't sail out of sight of land because they would get lost. They didn't have compasses. They didn't have sextants. They didn't know where they were. And if you sail away from land, you might not be able to find it again. And so they had to stay within sight of land. But with the invention of the compass and the sextant, it was possible to navigate by the stars. So you could go away from the land and you could still know where you were. Okay? And so what happens is then that Europeans start to venture out into the ocean, and they will eventually find a series of islands out here called the Azores and the Canaries. Right? And these islands, what will happen is that the Europeans will conquer these islands and enslave the people, right? Now, what's really interesting about that is that all the people in these islands are white, right? So what that means is that the Europeans use of slavery didn't really have much to do with race at that time. It had more to do with, what could I use for labor to create profit. All right? And they used the white natives here, okay? But at any rate, the point is that as they continued to sail, they found their way around Africa. This is the Portuguese. Now, I'm talking about one of the things that drew them around Africa was this legend of a place that was so wealthy that the king was covered in gold and that would be El Dorado, the golden one. Right. Or the gold gilded one, I guess you could say. All right. So they believed that El Dorado was somewhere in East Africa. And so they kept exploring until eventually they found their way around the cape and into the Indian Ocean. And once they got into the Indian Ocean, they discovered these trading routes that the Muslims had been operating for years. And the Portuguese had a technological advantage over the Muslims because one of the technologies that the Portuguese had developed was brass cannon. Right? So the Portuguese were literally able to blow their competition out of the water, and they established a carrying trade. Carrying trade. It's kind of like an early modern ups. Right. They would get stuff in one place, and they would take it to another place, and they would trade what they had carried for something else, and then they would take that to someplace else, and they would continue trading. And then all of the money from that trade is going to eventually make its way back to Portugal. So Portugal will become really a wealthy trading nation. Okay? So now, if we look, then if we at the time of la de conquista in 1492, there's trade with Europe. Remember that. Keeping in mind that Europe doesn't have much to trade, what the Portuguese are trading is their navigation technology, essentially, right? But there's trade with Europe. Some of the trade is over land, and that trade is dominated by the Italians, the Venetians, and the Genovese. Right. And then there's trade over water, and that trade is dominated by the Portuguese. Right? And now we have this appearance of a new, aggressive nation that wants to expand, but there really is no place for them to expand to. They can't expand into the overland trade because the overland trade is controlled by the Italians, and they can't expand into the overwater trade because it's controlled by Portuguese."

","George Washington's decision to step down after two terms as president of the United States in 1796 established a precedent that would endure for well over a century until the ratification of the 22nd amendment in 1951. Recognizing the significance of this moment, Washington chose to deliver a farewell address to the nation. While not a spoken address but a written document, it served as a final message from the father of our country, offering parting advice for the future of the young republic. Though Alexander Hamilton assisted in the writing of the farewell address, the content undoubtedly reflected Washington's own convictions. The address addressed two key the dangers of political factionalism and the appropriate course for american foreign policy. Having witnessed the bitter partisan battles that arose during his own presidency, particularly between the Federalists led by Hamilton, and the democratic Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, Washington warned against the divisive nature of political parties. He believed such factions could threaten national unity. Furthermore, Washington laid the groundwork for a principle that would guide american foreign policy for much of the 19th century. Avoiding permanent entanglements in european affairs, he advocated for a policy of neutrality in the conflicts raging between european powers, such as the ongoing struggle between Britain and France. However, Washington also stressed the importance of maintaining strong commercial ties with all nations, emphasizing the benefits of free trade for the young american economy. John Adams, the second president of the United States, was elected in 1796. In the context of the electoral college system at the time, the candidate receiving the most electoral votes became president, while the runner up became vice president. This unique system, later amended by the 12th Amendment in 1804, resulted in a situation where Adams, a the Federalist, found himself serving alongside his main political rival, Thomas Jefferson, a democratic Republican. Their ideological differences created a tense political environment. The 1796 election was indeed a bitterly contested one, marked by vicious personal attacks in the press. It's instructive to compare this historical example, where Jefferson was depicted as a puppet of the devil, undermining the government, to more recent elections where similar tactics have been employed. This comparison highlights a certain continuity in american political discourse, raising questions about the evolution of political stability. The presidential election of 1800 marked a turning point in american political history. Often termed the Revolution of 1800, the election pitted incumbent John Adams against Thomas Jefferson once again, with Adams ultimately failing to secure a majority in the electoral college. Jefferson, too, did not achieve a clear majority due to a tie with Aaron Burr. As stipulated by the constitution. A deadlocked electoral college meant the election would be decided by the house of representatives. With each state delegation casting a single vote, the federalist controlled House reached an impasse. While they could not support the re election of Adams, they were equally opposed to electing either Jefferson or Burr, both staunch democratic Republicans. This stalemate brought the nation to the brink of a constitutional crisis. The governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia threatened to call up their state militias to install Jefferson, a scenario that would have gravely undermined the very foundations of american democracy. Faced with imminent chaos, Jefferson found himself in the difficult position of negotiating a compromise with his bitter political rival, Alexander Hamilton, the agreement denied by both men until their debts secured Jefferson's presidency in exchange for maintaining the federalist financial system. This crucial moment underscores the potential fragility of a young democracy and the absolute necessity of compromise. A failure to find common ground would have undermined the fundamental principles of the american republic. The events of 1800 offer a timeless lesson in a functioning democracy. Even the most ardent adversaries must be willing to seek compromise to ensure the nation's progress. We will analyze the intricacies of this pivotal election and its far reaching implications in more detail in a later lecture. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas. If you have any questions, you can post them in the open forum discussion, or contact the professor using canvas. Email."

","Hello. We're going to talk today about the american expansion into the Transmississippi west. We're going to focus some on the events that actually happened during that period of time, but we're going to mainly focus on an issue or a concept in the historical profession called historiography. H I s t o r I o g r a p h y. Historiography. And that is essentially the history of history. It is a story. It is the history of how the narrative has been told over time. And what we're going to look at today is how Americans saw expansion into the west during the 19th century, and then how that perception of it changed in the 20th century. Now, the thing about the west is there's a certain subset or a certain set of things that happened between the period, say, around 1850 and 1900, that involved the settlement of the west. And most of it was actually pretty mundane, as we'll kind of discover here in a minute. But it was mythologized by Americans. Americans saw the conquest of the west as the playing out of the american mission to spread its ideals and its ideology and its civilization across the continent, kind of a fulfillment of the idea of manifest destiny. The theme of the American west is mythologized in literature and in performing acts, performing troops like Buffalo Bill, Wild west, or Buffalo Bill's Wild west show, and in movies. I mean, you guys probably have seen tons of movies about the west, and they were even more prevalent when I was younger. What happens is that we develop this myth about what happened in the west. And because it's been so mythologized, it's hard for us to really take a clear eyed look at what actually that. And that's what we're going to be really addressing in today's lecture. But what really ends up happening is that the west comes to symbolize the United States, both for Americans and for foreigners, right? So if you want to think about what is the quintessential image of the United States, it's the cowboy. And I'm going to show you that in a second here. The thing that we need to start off by saying is that the cowboy is not this heroic, liberty loving, nature loving knight of the plains. It's actually, being a cowboy was actually meant to herd cattle across the countryside. And that was a very difficult job. It was something that was performed by young guys, and it was really kind of menial manual labor. So it's a lot like mythologizing, if we were today mythologizing construction workers or truck drivers, it's not that those are not honorable professions. It is that we don't really think of construction workers as being representative of our ideal and our. So let's take a look then at a representation of the cowboy. And I got this actually from the LA Times quite some time ago. And obviously the date in this was in 2003. And it just occurred to me recently that this is probably really dated for you guys because it's talking about it was during the time of the United States contemplating the invasion of Iraq. And the Americans were pushing very hard for an invasion, and our allies in Europe were pushing back on it, so much so that the French were vocally against american intervention or anybody's intervention in Iraq. And the United States, people in the United States were offended by that. So that for some period of time we had freedom fries instead of french fries. But at any rate, so this is part of that debate that comes out of the LA Times at that period of time. And what we can see here is really two mirrors. And the mirrors, on the one hand, how do Americans see Americans? And that you see that there's the cowboy with, he's clean cut, he's wearing a star, he's got a white hat. He is the representation of the good guy. And then on the other hand, the way the Europeans see Americans is this slovenly, dirty, smoking bandit waving his guns around and standing in a pool of blood and wearing a black hat. What we see then is that both Americans and Europeans think of Americans as cowboys. But a cowboy can be defined in two different ways, either as a hero or as a villain. And then in the middle of the picture, you can see George Bush, who was president at the time, trying to make this decision or pushing this idea of invading Iraq. The main thing to take away from this is that the cowboy essentially becomes the representation of the United States both for Americans and for foreigners."
16,"US1: 116 -Consequences of the Reformation
","I want to spend a few minutes talking about some of the consequences of the Reformation. This wasn't just about changing how people worshipped; it was a seismic shift that shook the very foundations of society. First off, think about this - the Reformation splintered the once cohesive Christian Empire. Imagine a Europe where everyone's under one religious banner, and suddenly, it's all in pieces. Why? Well, thanks to this notion of _cuius regio, eius religio_ (whoever rules chooses the religion). In simple terms, rulers got to pick their realm's religion, which, as you can guess, led to some serious divides. This was more than just a religious split; it redefined the entire European political and religious scene. It gave rulers leverage against the power of the Church by threatening to break away if they didn't get their way. So with the Church's influence on the decline the secular rulers became more powerful. These guys saw their chance and took it, shifting the power from a church-centered world to a state-centered one. These princes weren't just bystanders; they were key players in shaping Europe's religious and political future. The Reformation wasn't just about religion. It brought in fresh perspectives on worship and spirituality. This wasn't just about going to church and following rituals; it was about personal connections with faith, individual interpretations of sacred texts. This was the starting point for how we view religion today. The Reformation massively boosted literacy. Rather than achieving salvation through the Church sacraments, Protestants believed they could only by justified by faith, and that faith was to be obtained by reading the Bible. People needed to be taught how to read, and the Bible needed to be translated from Latin, which only the educated knew, into the ""vernacular,"" or the common language. This was actually the foundation for our idea of the need for public education. But if you can read the Bible you can read other things -- even radical texts. So the Reformation opened up a whole world of knowledge to the masses. At the time there were thousands of different dialects in Europe. The need to translate the Bible into the vernacular led to a standardization of languages. For example, rather than hundreds of different dialects in what we today call France, the Bible for French speakers was translated into Parisian French, and that became the common language of France. By translating texts into the common language, people started feeling a stronger connection to their nation, not just their local town or region. This lays the groundwork for the development of nationalism. It doesn't happen yet, but by the time we get to the American Revolution it will have a major effect on world affairs.  The Reformation ushered in an era of intense and often brutal religious conflict, primarily between Catholics and Protestants. This period was characterized by attempts to enforce religious uniformity, often through violent means. Out of this violence driven by religious zealotry, we see the dawn of the Enlightenment. Intellectuals started questioning traditional religious views, leading to a new era of thought. Thinkers like Montesquieu, Jefferson, Franklin, Locke, and Diderot – advocate replacing religious revelation with rationality, for a secular approach to knowledge and the conduct of world affairs. Some, like Locke, advocated religious tolerance, separation of church and state – an idea that was revolutionary at the time. Others wanted to ban religion altogether. The Reformation was more than a religious movement. It reshaped Europe's political, social, and cultural landscapes. It set the stage for modern Europe, paving the way for the Enlightenment and the rise of secularism. It's a period that echoes through history, influencing much of what we see in today's world. These changes still resonate in our world. "
17,"US1: 146 -US1: 146
","I want to talk about specific aspect of the spanish empire. I'm going to start off by saying that when the Spanish came, as I already mentioned to you, they didn't come because of their sense of adventure. They came because they wanted to make money. And. And the people who came to America were the adventurers. Most of them didn't come to America because they wanted to live way out in the middle of nowhere, a little house in the prairie, right? Most of them came because they wanted to exploit the land, get as much wealth as they could, and go back to Spain where they could live like Idalgos, right? Idalgo is Ejos de Algo, son of something, right? Big shots, essentially, right. The optimum situation for them would have been to find El Dorado, big pile of gold, grab the gold and go back, right? They couldn't do that. So they realized eventually that they were going to have to exploit the land, especially in the Caribbean, as I mentioned, because it was a subsistence economy. They actually tried to enslave the natives in the Caribbean, but the natives didn't survive. They weren't good slaves and they didn't survive. So they would have to replace that later, and we'll talk about that on a different day. But the point is that what ends up happening is that the people who came to conquer America and to extract the value did it because they wanted to make money, okay? And so what ends up happening is that rather than being able to divide up a bunch of gold that they were able to steal, instead they actually ended up dividing the land. And what they divided the land into was called encomiendas. Right? Now we'll just say it that there's actually two different words for that in Spanish, the encomienda and the repatimiento. But mostly it's called the encomienda systems. We'll call it that. And the encomienda system is very much like the feudal system. I don't know if you remember the drawing that I made. Let me see if I can do it here. The drawing that I made of the feudal system in Europe was that there was an area of land that we would call the thief, and on the land there was a manor where the lord lived, and then there was a village, and there were fields of the lord, and there were commons, right? And the encomienda system is going to be similar to this, because what will happen is that essentially the king still owns all of the land, but he's going to allow an encomendero to use the land and his use of the land is going to be to profit from the work of the campacinos or the Indios, right? All right, so instead of peasants we have indios. Instead of lords we have encommanderos, right? The theory was that just like in Europe, the Indios could use the land and they could support themselves on the land as long as they paid labor to the incomendero, right? And then in return for that, the incomendero was supposed to provide protection and christian indoctrination. The reality mean. The reality was that the source of income that the incomendero was going to get came from the labor of the Indios. What's the problem with that? What's happening to the Indios? They were dying. They were dying. What were they dying of? Disease. They were dying of diseases, right? And so what we see happening with the encomienda system is that the source of income for the encomndero is small and decreasing. And then once the indios have all died, there won't be any more profit. And so what? The response of the ankle Menderos is to work the indios as hard as they can so that they can produce as much as they possibly can in order to give the encomndero as much profit as he can get. Because once they're dead, that's the end of the profit and hopefully he'll have enough to go back to Spain and live like an Indal. Okay, so what ends up happening then is that the incomenderos are working the Indians hard because they're dying. But what's going to happen is that there's going to be a priest, his name is Bartolome de las Casas, here. And what Las Casas will argue is that the encomnderos are working the Indians to death right? Now. That's not exactly correct, because the Indians were dying, but not because they were being worked to death but because of disease, right? But nevertheless they were dying. It doesn't make it any better for the uncle Manderos who were just using them for profit, right? But the main thing is that Bartolome de las Casas will publicize what's going on with the Indians in Europe in a book that he wrote, which in English we call the destruction of the Indies, is going to portray the encomenderos as brutal beasts who are exploiting the Indians. It was illustrated with these, I forgot what they call these things, lienotypes or something like that. But at any rate, the point is you can see here they're cutting off the Indians hands, and they're running around bleeding and things like that. Now, it wasn't as bad as this, although it was bad, right? But at any rate, the point here is that developed what's called the black legend. The black legend is that the Spanish came to America, they killed the Indians and stole all their stuff. And so the black legend then will be associated with spanish colonization in America. From then on, the rest of the Europeans will look and say, oh, look what the Spanish did in Spanish America. Ignoring the fact that the French and the British do the same things in North America based on the economics, right? So we'll see, for example, that the British come to North America and eventually drive off all the natives because the natives are living in subsistence economies and they can't make any money that way. So they drive the natives off the land so they can make money from the land, okay? That's not different from what the Spanish did. Okay, so the Spanish weren't any more or less brutal than any of the other Europeans, okay? It's just that their brutality was more highly publicized. Okay? All right, so now what happens is that this guy de las Casas gets the attention of the king of Spain. And the king of Spain is going to say that these new people in the Americas are my subjects and they need to be protected. Okay? That's what Las Casas is going to argue. So there's going to be a great debate in a place called via Dolid in Spain. Right? Let me go ahead and write that here. Via Dolid. I'm sorry, you're going to actually see this in a video that you'll see later on via Dolid. But the video is BBC video, so they mispronounce everything anyway. Via Dolid in Spain. And the debate will be between Las Casas and another guy named Juan Hines de Sepulvira, who the british call Sepulveda. Right. But at any rate, if you were going to actually write this, there would be an accent over the U. Okay. At any rate, Juan Hinesi Sipobeda. All right, so what Las Casas argues is that the natives are rational human beings who deserve the king's protection. And what Sepulvada will argue is that the natives are less than human, not fully human, but they can be educated. They can be made human, educated into humanity. And the price of that education is labor. So on the one hand, Las Casa sees this vast group of people who are being exploited and saying that we don't have a right to exploit them because they're rational human beings who deserve the king's protection. They're just like us. And we see then Sepulvada arguing against that by saying, well, they're not quite human, actually. They're not the same color as us. And not only that, but they aren't civilized like us. And so we can teach them to be civilized, but they have to pay a price for that, and the price is going to be their labor. So on the one hand, we have this kind of condemnation of the encomienda system, and on the other hand, we have an argument in favor of it. Okay? And what's really interesting about this is that this is the first debate in world history on the issue of human rights. Who's human and who has rights. It happens first in the spanish empire. And what the king will decide is that Las Casas is right, that Las Casas, that the natives are rational human beings, and they do deserve the king's protection. And so what will happen is that the king will outlaw the encomienda. Now, it's outlawed in 1542, and there are still encomiendas in the 18th century. And the reason for that is because the application of law in the spanish empire was slow, often very slow. Right? But the main thing is that in theory, what ends up happening is that the rule of the Indians, the rule of the Americas, goes out of the hands of the conquistadores and into the hands of bureaucrats. And what will happen then is that the spanish empire will be divided into viceroyalties, where people, the viceroys, actually act in the name of the king. And then that will be divided into other areas, geographical areas, that will eventually end up pretty much following the division of Spanish America into the countries that it is now, and even, for example, in Mexico, of where the states are. But it comes under the rule of the Spanish. All right? So that's going to essentially be the spanish empire, and it won't really change very much for the next 300 years. Okay, we'll talk later in our course about how the empire comes to an end and what the effect of that is going to be on the United States. But for now, we just want to conclude, I guess you could say that all of the authority in the spanish empire will rest in the king. And the reason why that's important is because if the king is wise, like King Philip was when he called this, this debate, then the empire is ruled wisely. But if the king's an idiot, which happens, then the empire is ruled idiotically, all right? And that's going to be the weakness of the spanish empire, and eventually it will come to an end."
18,"US2: 411 -US2: 411
","I'd like for you guys to remember what was the last thing we talked about last Monday? Somebody tell me the revolution of 1800. What was the revolution of 1800? On my notes, I had written down that it was Adams versus Jefferson, and then the electoral college got split between Jefferson and Burr. And then the election ended up going to the house. Exactly. Exactly. And what, how did, how was the election finally resolved? You're absolutely right on it, Sean. There was a compromise that led to the election of Jefferson. Okay. All right. And the compromise was between who and who? You're right. Absolutely. Jefferson. And who was his great antagonist? Hamilton. Hamilton, exactly. Do you guys remember, this is important. You should remember this. Right. The first party system. This was the way that the different visions of the country split themselves apart during the Washington administration. So if you remember, Hamilton was secretary of the treasury, Jefferson was secretary of state. But they had very different visions. The country. And that Hamilton thought that the country should be a great industrial, commercial power, and Jefferson thought it should be a landscape of liberty. He was more idealistic. And so then we saw that that led to two different views. On the one hand, the people that followed Hamilton were known as federalists. They were mostly in the northeast because that was really the industrial center of the United States. Some of the most more famous federalists were Washington and Adams, and they wanted a strong central government so that they could encourage commerce and industry. And then they wanted to enact plans that weren't particularly specified in the constitution, like a national bank. And so they, they thought that the constitution was a. Like a framework that could be added to. Okay, you guys remember this? Questions? Comments? Okay, because I'm going to come back and I'm going to ask you again. And, you know, these long, pregnant silences are kind of uncomfortable for everybody, so you should be able to answer these questions. Right. All right, so next, then we have the people that followed Jefferson were democratic Republicans, is what they call themselves sometimes just Republicans. Some of the more famous of them were Madison and Monroe. You'll hopefully recall that James Madison was the one who really kind of encouraged or promoted the new constitution. They believe that the government, the government, that if there should be any government at all, it should be closer to the people. So they thought the state should be supreme in the federal system. And they also believe that the Constitution was specific in the powers that it granted to the federal government. It couldn't be. Couldn't be. What's the word I'm looking for? It couldn't be. It couldn't be broken. You could only go by what the constitution said and nothing else. Right. Now, let me just make kind of an observation about legal practice today, and that will be that there are still people who call themselves strict constructionists and loose constructionists. And when we look at the court system today, the federal court system and the Supreme Court, it is the more conservative justices who call themselves strict constructionists. Okay. Now. And then it's more liberal justices that say, no, the Constitution is a living document that needs, that can be, that can be interpreted to mean things that weren't intended actually originally. Like, for example, same sex marriage. Same sex marriage wasn't something that was an issue in 1787. So it wasn't in the Constitution. But loose constructionists will say, yeah, well, we could find that right in the constitution because it evolved, whereas strict constructionists would say, well, it's not in the Constitution, so you can't say anything about it. You guys get what I'm saying? You guys follow that? Questions? Comments? All right. Well, this is important, really, in terms of what it's important to be a citizen. Now, most of the Republicans, but not all of them were in the south. There were some Republicans in, like, for example, Pennsylvania. Right. And New York. Actually, Aaron Burr was from New York. Right. But the difference in terms of the economy between the two was that Jefferson believed in an agricultural economy but not a plantation economy. Right. So even though the south was a plantation economy, vision of his, of his country wasn't plantation agriculture but single family farms, which is something that we're going to talk about here in just a few minutes. All right. So you guys get the difference between the two, the split between the two, right. And I think that I may have already mentioned and that we'll continue to look at the split actually really can be boiled down to a country that is an economic powerhouse or a country that is a bastion of liberty, a kind of a, what's the word I'm looking for? More of a beacon of liberty. Right. And keep in mind that we talked about the liberal revolution, the idea that the united, the american revolution was the beginning of this revolution of liberty that would be spread throughout the world. So the United States was a, a revolutionary government that exported revolution around the world. Okay. Questions? Comments? Can we think of any countries that are like that today, any countries that are trying to export revolution? I'm not sure if this country applies, but Hong Kong, I believe, well, they are struggling for democracy, but they're not trying to export revolution. Okay. When we think about a country that's, that's trying to export revolution, generally, speaking, most countries that are more conservative will be very much against them. Right. And I'm not saying that because you do export revolution. That's a good thing. Right. But I do. I do think that there's at least one country today that's very heavily involved in the idea of spreading revolution. Iran. Iran. Exactly. Iran is trying to spread its islamic revolution. Right. So the way that countries of the world looked at the United States then, is very much the way that the countries of the world look at Iran today. You guys follow what I'm saying? Okay, I know that's uncomfortable for you, but that's just to kind of emphasize to you how radical the american experiment was at that time. Okay. Questions? Comments about any of that? Okay, let's go a little bit further now, and let's think about the relationship between Hamilton and Jefferson. Hamilton and Jefferson almost went to fistfights in the White House during the Washington administration, and they came to really despise each other and the people that followed Hamilton came to despise the people that followed Jefferson and vice versa. Right. So it was not. Okay, well, you guys believe one thing and we believe something else, but we all believe that were good Americans. It was the people who were the Hamiltonians or the federalists thought that the democratic Republicans were a bunch of wild eyed liberals. Wild eyed revolutionaries. Right. And the Democratic Republicans thought that the federalists were a bunch of monarchists. Okay, now let's try to put that in contemporary terms. What that would mean would be that the democratic Republicans thought that the federalists were Nazis and the federalists thought that the democratic Republicans were communists. Okay? They didn't have Nazis and communists back then, but it was the same kind of split. Do you guys get what I'm saying here? Questions? Comments? And so then the idea here wasn't that if we lose the election, well, that's too bad. We'll come back next time and try again. The idea was that if the country continues under the rule of either side, depending on which side you're on, it's the end. The country's going to end. Right. So Jefferson believed that because of the kind of monarchist tendencies of the federalists, that it might be. Might be necessary for there to be a new revolution. And Hamilton, the people that followed Hamilton believed that if Jefferson took over, it would be the end of the country. He would sell the country out to the French. You see what I'm saying? So when there was this election in 1800 between Jefferson and Adams. Okay, so Jefferson ran. Hamilton didn't run. He was more like a kind of a background figure, but he was the really chief of the Federalists. But Adams ran against Jefferson. Right. And we see then these two very different visions of the country coming up for a vote. Okay? And the outcome of the election was that the Federalists would never win according to the. According to the constitution, because Adams didn't get as many electors as either Jefferson or his running mate, Aaron Burr. So the outcome of the election had to be either Jefferson or Burr. But we'll recall that because they didn't, nobody got a majority, that the election went to the house and the house was controlled by federalists. And so what ended up happening was that there was a stalemate in the house where. Where they kept taking votes, and this over a period of about a month. And they kept taking votes and the votes always came out the same. It was a tie between Jefferson and Burr. And Adams came in third every time. Right? So the way that. That. Well, eventually what ended up happening was that the republican governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania threatened to call up the troops to install Jefferson as president. And the outcome of that, essentially was that Jefferson and Hamilton made a secret deal. And the secret deal was that Jefferson would be elected president and then Jefferson would leave in place the federalist financial system, which included the national bank, which was something that the democratic Republicans thought was completely unconstitutional. But they made this hard compromise, and Jefferson then was elected president. And so the election of 1800, which was the first time that there was a change in the kind of direction of the government was handed, was accomplished peacefully without any bloodshed. Now, when we look at that, we say, well, that's no big deal. I mean, that happens all the time. It has always happened in american history, and it's almost always true. But. But this was the first time that that had ever happened that it was possible. Whenever there was one party in power and the other party gained power, then there was always bloodshed to determine who was going to win, right? And although this was really, they didn't really have this experience with democracy, but if we look later at the latin american revolutions, at the revolution in Mexico and Argentina and anywhere, and even in France, right, when they have the revolution there, the idea was that when one party, when there's an election and the party in power loses the election, then they always declared the election to be a fraud and they ended up fighting it out. Right? And then the result of that was that the vote really didn't matter. It was just a prelude to a war that happened every election. You guys get what I'm saying, but that didn't happen in the United States. And what that means is that the United States proved that it was possible for democracy to work. That's the example of the validity of democracy. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So this is an incredibly important event in world history that the United States was able to survive this crisis of elections. And what happens then to these two different visions of the United States is that this becomes the big question for american politics from then all the way through. So the question really here is going to be between, I think, economics and idealism, right. And instead of fighting it out in the streets, people fight it out in the ballot boxes. Right. And so as we go through american history, we can see that sometimes the people who are. Who are promoting a strong economy are triumphant, and sometimes the people who are more liberal are triumphant, but it goes back and forth, and it's always a peaceful transfer between them. You guys get what I'm saying? So what the election of 1800 did was it institutionalized that conflict between the two visions of the country. And that's why those two visions of the country are still there today. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? That some people think that the United States should exercise its power for the benefit of the american economy, and some people think that the United States should be a beacon of freedom, liberty and justice. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about any of this? So this is the basis, then, for american politics. And it's also the proof that democracy can work. Although I have to say, and I've mentioned this before, that this happens in America, in the United States at 1800, doesn't happen anywhere else for the next 75 years. For the next 75 years, whenever there's an election where one party loses control to another, they always fight it out everywhere that you look. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about that? What do you guys think? Any questions? Comments? Yeah, I have a quick question. Okay, good. So would the threat of military action if Jefferson wasn't put in power, would that sort of be like if today, like if the Capitol invasion would have just been a threat, or was it kind of a different idea? Okay, so the difference between what happened this year and what happened then is that essentially what happened this year was an extra judicial mob, meaning that it wasn't organized by any government. Okay. There were organizations involved, but it was outside the government. And where we saw in the election of 1800, we had governments that were actually raising militia to accomplish this. You see the difference? But the idea essentially is the same. The idea is that if you don't like the outcome of the election, then you use force to overturn it. Do you see what I'm saying? Although I will say that what happened this year was that people were against what happened. The people that invaded the capital were against the outcome of the revolution of the election, and the armies in 1800 were in favor of the change of power. You guys get what I'm saying? You get what I'm saying? So those are the differences. Yeah. But anytime, anytime that you want to use force to overturn the will of the people, that would be something that would be a threat to democracy. Okay. Thank you. And it really sets a bad example for the democratic system, a bad precedent. All right. Questions, comments? That's a good question, Sean. Thank you. Any other questions."
19,"US2: 212 -US2: 212
","I'm going to talk about the issues, and then I'm going to talk about the different political parties and how they responded to the issues. Okay? The first thing I want to talk about is patronage. Patronage is political favors in return for political support. Generally speaking, in the american system, political favors are jobs, and political support is votes, right? So essentially what you're doing is you're exchanging votes for jobs, right? And one place where we can see that, I don't know how much of this you guys remember, but if you go back to 2008, when in the democratic primary, we had Obama and Hillary Clinton running against each other, and it became evident that Obama was going to win. And so Hillary Clinton made a deal with Obama, and the deal that she made was that she would endorse him and encourage her supporters to support him in return for her becoming secretary of state. You see what happens? So that's patronage. Patronage happens when you trade your support for a job. And that's something that happens in american politics. It used to happen at every level, right? It started really at the other level, at the other end, where you had groups of new voters who are organized into voting blocs. And I'm going to demonstrate that by asking you about Bugs Bunny. How many of you guys have seen Bugs Bunny cartoons? Does anybody notice that in Bugs Bunny cartoons, the cops. If there's a cop in the cartoon, they always have a certain accent. What is that accent? Now, I want you to watch this. Okay? Clancy, take the boys and surround the house. Jesus, fellas, cops. All right, Rabbit, where's Rocky? Where is he hiding? He's not in this stove. He's hiding in the stove. Eh? Would I turn on the gas if he was in there? You might, Travis. You might. Well, would I throw a lighted match in there if he was in there? Oh, no, you don't. Take me with you. I confess. I did it. I did it. Arrest me. So you guys get it. So why do you think that the cops in Bugs Bunny cartoons have irish accents? See, you thought this class was going to be a waste of time, but I'm going to tell you why. And the reason why was because there was immigration to the United States. And when immigrants came to the United States, like, for example, if you were an irish immigrant, you would go to an american city like Boston or New York or someplace like that. And there'd be sections of the city that were kind of divided off by country of origin. So there'd be an irish section, and there'd be an italian section. There'd be a jewish section, that sort of. And if you were irish, you came to America and you came to a city and you're in the irish section of the city and you're looking for a job. Where you're going to find a job is you're going to go down to the hiring hall. There's a place called the hiring hall. And there's a guy that runs the hiring hall, and we call him the boss. It's not bowser from Super Mario Brothers. It's actually a machine boss or political boss. And this political boss controls government jobs, right? So the reason why he's able to control the government jobs is because he's able to organize the voters in his district to vote for whoever is police commissioner. So basically what happens then is you go down to the boss at the hiring hall and you say, okay, I want a job. He says, okay, you can be a cop. Because the irish job was cops, right? So you can be a cop, and for 364 days a year you would be a policeman. But on election day, your job was to make sure that everybody got out and voted early and often to make sure your guy stayed in office, because if your guy stayed in office, then you could keep your job. So your job is a government favor in return for political favor in return for the political support, which is the votes. Right. And really the way that it happens is that the boss is able to deliver the vote, so he gets to be the one who gives out the job. Now that's going to be a good system if you want people to be loyal to who's ever in office, because whoever is in office is the one who gives you your job. Right. But there's going to be a downside to it, too. What do you think that is? If you want to make sure that you stay the boss, how are you going to do that? Well, one way is to organize the vote, right? You could say with 147% of the vote counter, we have a winner. Right. The other way would be to maybe grease the skids for the guy who's in office. Right? What would we call that? Bribery. Okay, so that means that american politics is inherently corrupt. American politics is inherently corrupt because it's driven by and money, rather than the free democratic spirit that was envisioned by the founders. You guys get what I'm saying here, right? Okay. The question then about patronage is going to be, should we keep it and keep our government corrupt, or should we get rid of it? And if we did get rid of it, then how would we give out government jobs? And the answer is going to be by civil service reform, essentially going from the patronage system where you give out jobs for support, like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, or in the cities, rather than having whoever shows up at the hiring hall and delivering the votes, getting the job, it's somebody who's actually been trained to be the policeman, right? And then when the government changes, you don't get a whole new set of policemen, right? So you get government stability. So the question then is going to be between this corruption that's represented in patronage and it's on every level of american government, or are we going to have civil service reform? All right. Okay. The next one, money. The United States for the era going into the civil war had its economy based on the gold standard. The reason why was because the British were on the gold standard and the Americans wanted to be in competition with the British. So if they were going to compete with Britain, they had to be on the same standard. And so they adopted the gold standard. And what the gold standard means is that for every dollar in circulation, there is a dollar's worth of gold in the treasury, okay? The dollar is actually a representation of species. The word they call it is specie, right? So one dollars bill is worth one dollars worth of species. And the species is gold. All right? So one dollars bill is equal to one dollars worth of gold. All right? Now, during the civil war, what happens is that the United States goes off the gold standard. And the reason why is because they needed more money to buy uniforms and things like that. So they wanted more money in circulation. And by putting more money in circulation, they were able to do all the things that they said they were going to do. The problem is that as you put more and more money into circulation, but you have the same amount of species, what happens to the money? Decreases in value. It decreases in value. And we call that what? Inflation. Right. Inflation. Exactly. Right. Now, I'm going to give you some numbers here just to imagine it's not the real number, right? But let's say that during this, I mean, we do see inflation, right? And let's say that during the civil war. At the beginning of the Civil war, one dollars was worth one dollars in species, right? But by the end of the civil war, one dollars was only worth $0.10 in specie. Or the other way around that it took $10 to get one to represent one dollars worth of species. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay? Now, after the Civil war, a lot of people wanted to go directly back to the gold standard. And the reason why was because they wanted, again, to be able to compete with the British. Okay? The problem was that if you went, let's say that at the end of the civil war, the United States said, okay, now we're going to go right back to one dollars worth of currency is equal to one dollars worth of gold. That would mean that in reality it would take $10 for one dollars. You get what I'm saying? So let's say that at the beginning of the Civil war, you borrowed $100, and at the end of the civil war, you had to pay it back. But they went back to the gold standard, you'd have to pay back $1,000. Okay, so that's a problem. All right, who's it going to be a problem for? Well, it's going to be a big problem for farmers, right? Because the way farming works is at the beginning of the growing season, you borrow money and then you buy seed and whatever equipment you need, and you support yourself through the growing season. And in the harvest time, you harvest your crops, you take them down to the railhead and you sell them. And when you sell the crops, you get the money that you sold it for. You pay back the loan from the beginning of the year, and then whatever's left over is your profit. Okay? So if you borrowed $100 at the beginning of the year, and all of a sudden at the end of the year, you owed $1,000, that's a big problem, isn't it? Right. So then we think about, well, the money issue then is going to be, should we stay on what they call the green bags, or in your book, it's called soft money? Or should we go back to the gold standard and we'll talk more about that in a second. All right. Okay. The next one. The tariff is a big issue. It's always been a big issue in american politics. And the reason why is because America had two different economies, right? It had an industrial economy and it had an agrarian economy. This was one of the major causes of the civil war because the north wanted to raise tariffs. Tariffs are a tax on imports, right? So the commercial interests, the industrial interests wanted to raise tariffs because that made their products more competitive. You can look at at the beginning of the national republic, at the time the constitution went into effect, the situation was that you could actually buy better quality goods from England than American because the English were better at industrialization. They had already industrialized to a certain extent, and Americans hadn't. So american manufacturers couldn't beat with the British. So what they wanted to do was they wanted to raise the tariff so that the british goods would cost more and that would put them in competition with Americans who would give a product that costs less, maybe wasn't as good, but it costs a lot less. So tariffs are going to be good for industry because it protects them. It gives them an advantage over foreign competition. All right? And that is something that Americans enact and it really works for the United States. The United States does become a great industrial power because of that. Right? It surpasses Britain and every other power by the beginning of the 20th century. Okay? But it's going to have a harmful effect on the south because the south, its major source of income is export agriculture. And that means that the countries that are importing America's exports are going to respond to the Americans raising tariffs by raising their own tariffs. And that means that when the american cotton growers sell their goods in Britain, they're not going to get as much money for it as the otherwise it's wood. Right? So the tariffs are going to be harmful to the american plantation owners because they don't get as much money. And in going even further than that, because they are in export agriculture, they don't manufacture things. And that means that anything that's manufactured that they need, they have to import. And when those things that they import they're having to pay more for because they have to pay these tariffs. So it's a double whammy for the south. Okay? It's good for the north, but it's a double whammy for the south. Okay? So the question is going to be, it's a perennial question, really. Should we have high tariffs and protect american industry or should we have low tariffs and protect american agriculture? The main thing is to understand the tariffs essentially are supposed to be good for industry and, and they're not good for agriculture. And in the beginning, the tariffs that Americans raised before the civil war actually did protect american industry. So it was, it was actually a win at that point."

","I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna talk about the actual battles and all that stuff, because all you gotta do is turn on the History Channel, and it's like they're bombing Germany right now. So, I mean, basically, they. I think they call the History Channel the war channel. All right? But it's. If you want to learn about the battles and all that. Look at that. But what we're gonna talk about is the effect, really, that world War Two had on american life, okay? And the one thing just to start off with is, I will say that World War Two is probably one of the watershed moments in american history. What I mean by watershed means is that everything changes. Everything changes because of this war. The civil war was the same. Right. The civil war basically created a completely different country than had existed before the civil war. Right? And the same thing happens here. And the way that it happens is that up until the time of the civil war, there were undercurrents of conflict that were kind of hidden. They were kept under. Under the radar. Essentially. One of them was civil rights, okay, that there was Jim Crow, and there was discrimination all over the place, right? And everybody knew about it, but nobody talked about it. And so because of that really wasn't a problem, right? But what happens with World War Two, as you guys saw in that movie Los Maneros, right, is that when we call upon everybody to participate in the war, then everybody's going to demand a place at the table after the war, right? So World War Two is going to then basically open the door to the civil rights movement. All right? One of the things that, for example, that happens is that black people were joining the military. Black people were going to work in war industries, but they were still discriminated against. And this guy, a. Philip Randolph, who was the head of the Porter cars union, organized a march on Washington. The march on Washington was supposed to be where black people marched on Washington to protest racism. But you'll recall that Roosevelt had framed the war against Germany and Japan as a war against racism, right? So how could you fight a war against racism when racism is your own besetting evil, right? And so what happens is that in order to prevent the march, Roosevelt actually signs an order that ends racial discrimination in industry. Okay? Now, it ends it legally. It doesn't actually end it in practice for quite some time, right? But at least this is a movement towards civil rights. You guys follow what I'm saying? And it wouldn't have happened without World War two. Same thing with women's rights. We see women went to work in the factories in World War one, women go to work in the factories in World War two. After World War one, women went right back to the kitchen, as you guys saw in that movie, the twenties, right? But after World War two, they say, I'm not going back to the kitchen. I want to do whatever I want. I'm not going to be a second class citizen anymore. Right? And so we see the beginning, then, of the women's rights movement, all right? And then immigration becomes a huge problem because the United States, american men, like the men in the grapes of wrath, okay, who are working in the fields in California, are now going off to war or are going to work in war related industries. And so there's a need for people to work in the fields. And the United States makes agreement with foreign countries that their citizens can come to the United States and work. It's called the bracero program. And that they would work in the United States and make money in the United States. And then one of the. One of the. Once the war was over, they would go back. Go back to Mexico or wherever they came from, right? But here's where this becomes a problem. It's because of the american constitution. The american constitution says that anybody born in the United States is a citizen. And so when these braceros come from Mexico to the United States and they have children, those children are citizens. And so after the war is over, the government saying, we guys are all here illegally, go back. Right? Well, they weren't here illegally when they came and they had kids, and those kids are not here illegally either, because they're citizens. You follow I'm saying? So this creates the whole issue of so called illegal immigration. Right? They were illegal like, they were legal when they came, but they were illegal when the United States didn't need them anymore. Right? You follow what I'm saying? All right? And then finally, we had already mentioned the japanese internment camps, which was incredibly racist. The only thing that we can say about that is that race was a factor in it. But it wasn't the only factor because, if you'll recall, there was the same kind of a backlash against Germans during world War one, and that wasn't necessarily a racist backlash. So what we, what we couch in racism often isn't any more than just fear, right? We saw it with the Irish, we saw it with Eastern Europeans, saw it with Jews and Catholics. Right? And now we see it with the Japanese. Okay? Or we see it with the Hispanics today, or Muslims. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments? About any of this. All right, so the point here then is that the war itself, even though the United States is going to come out of the war the most powerful and the most prosperous country on earth, it will lay itself open to conflict that will, by the end of the 1960s, lead to a real social disorder in the United States. Okay? And that's really what we're going to be talking about pretty much for the rest of the course. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Some people have argued that by 1968, the United States was one of the least politically stable countries in the world because there were political assassinations going on, riots in the streets. The United States was fighting an unpopular war. Right. And there was a lot of disaffection, disunity in the United States. All right? And it all comes out of this moment of triumph of the United States. We'll talk briefly about the legacy. Well, as I mentioned already, United States emerges as the most powerful nation, but unlike after world War one, Americans see it as their duty to. To take on the role of defenders of democracy, partially because the cold war, it comes to the forefront even before, really, the end of World War two. Okay, we'll talk more about that on a different day. But what the cold war essentially was a conflict, an ideological conflict between the United States and Soviet Union. And the ideology was based on economics because the Soviet Union was communist and was trying to spread communism, and the United States was capitalist and was trying to defend capitalism. Okay, you guys are with me. Okay? But it's couched in the terms of if you're an american, it's democracy versus communism or totalitarianism. And if you're a Russian, it's democracy because. Because communism in its final form is theoretically democratic, right? Okay, so it's a war between. It's a conflict between democracy and imperialism. They're going to say that american imperialism essentially is the last stage of capitalism, right? Okay, so that's how. That's how it's caught. That's how, that's how it's framed rhetorically and ideologically. But the reality after World War Two was that all of the european powers lost their empires, meaning that the British had to give up India, the French ended up having to give up Southeast Asia, and both of the countries had to give up their holdings in Africa. And when these countries become independent, this is what's called decolonization. When these countries become independent and the British and the French and the Germans and whoever was in control before leave, they leave behind countries that are devastated by colonialism. Their economies no longer exist, essentially. Right. Because their economy is framed basically for the support of the economy in the mother country. If the mother country is no longer there, then the economy collapses. Right. You guys follow what I'm saying? All right, so there's going to be, and this really ends up being a kind of a conflict between rich countries and poor countries, but it's going to get caught up in the cold war, the ideological issue, because the Russians are going to be, well, actually, both Russians and Americans are going to be trying to court these countries that are recently independent, and that's going to then lead to physical war. It happens in Asia in, say, Afghanistan, and it also happens in Southeast Asia in Vietnam. Right. So american involvement in Vietnam. Americans went into Vietnam thinking that they were saving the world for democracy, but what they really were doing was supporting a colonial regime, which we'll talk again about on a different day. Right. And that support for the colonial regime meant that the people were not on board with what the Americans were doing. We went in there saying, we were here to save you, and they said, we don't want to be saved. You guys get what I'm saying? Not everybody, but a lot of them. And that's part of this that you're going to be reading coming up as another document set that you'll be reading. Okay. All right. Questions, comments about any of that? And then finally, the last thing, as I mentioned, as with the song at the beginning, that it became possible after World War two for the world to be destroyed. If we look at World War one, it was a horrible war. Millions of people died, but the world went on. But with the introduction of nuclear weapons, it becomes possible to destroy the entire world, all the people of the world. Right. You know, this idea. I know it's kind of a theme nowadays of the post apocalyptic meaning that the apocalypse happens and there's people that are still scrounging around. That ain't going to happen. The only people that will survive a nuclear war are cockroaches. Right? They're not people, obviously. Okay? But the idea here is that this makes it possible now for the whole world to be destroyed. And people know this. Right. And so it's going to create what they call an age of anxiety. People are anxious about the fact that the world might end at any time if somebody just pushes the button. And this nuclear anxiety gets tied up with the cold war because both the United States and the Soviet Union have nuclear weapons. Right. So I want you guys to think about when you're reading that book, the Good War. The last story that I assigned you guys was street corner kids. And think about what this issue of nuclear anxiety has to do with those street corner kids."

","In this section we will examine the first years of the american republic and some of the challenges facing the new nation. We will also see the foundations of american politics that will continue into the present day and learn how Americans were able to discover the key to a successful democracy. The Continental Congress, which functioned as the de facto government throughout the American Revolution, transitioned into the governing body under the Articles of Confederation. Drafted during the latter stages of the war and ratified in 1781, the articles established a weak central government and a strong alliance of sovereign states. This emphasis on state autonomy limited the national governments authority quite significantly. The inherent weaknesses of the articles soon became apparent. The central government lacked the critical power to levy taxes, leading to chronic financial instability. Printing money was also outside its purview, further hindering its ability to address economic challenges. In addition, the articles did little to prevent disputes among the states regarding trade, land ownership, and other vital matters. These unresolved conflicts threatened the fragile unity of the newly formed nation. The constitutional convention initially convened to revise the articles of Confederation witnessed a more dramatic shift. James Madisons Virginia plan, introduced early on, proposed a complete overhaul creating a stronger central government. This deviated from the original intent of amending the articles, but ultimately fueled debate and compromise. The resulting document, as Benjamin Franklin acknowledged, wasnt ideal. It represented the best attainable solution at that time. Following its approval by the convention delegates, the constitution required ratification by individual states for national implementation. The constitutional convention, despite resulting in a ratified document, left two critical questions unresolved. These questions, central to the future course of the nation, were deliberately left open due to the inability to reach unanimous agreement. The first question concerned the balance of power between the federal government and individual states. Many delegates championed state sovereignty, believing that states should retain ultimate authority. Others advocated for the supremacy of the federal government. The second question dealt with the permanence of the union. A significant number of delegates, particularly from southern states, insisted on the right to secede from the union should it fail to serve their interests. The deliberate ambiguity surrounding these issues reflected a strategic compromise. Had the delegates attempted to definitively resolve them, the constitution might never have been ratified. This ambiguity set the stage for future political debates and ultimately became a primary factor in the outbreak of the civil war. We will continue to examine these unresolved questions throughout the course as they shaped much of american political history. So what did this new constitution do? We can understand it in a few ways. In this segment we are going to talk about federalism. In the next, we will explore the structure of the government it creates. What was the intention of the founders? And some reflection on how political reality differed from what the founders originally intended. Federalism is a fundamental principle that establishes a system of dual sovereignty. In simpler terms, there exist two distinct levels of government, the national government and the state governments. This national government, situated in Washington, DC, coexists with individual state governments like those in California, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Recall our previous discussions on the topic of national identity. Citizens primarily identified with their state or colony of origin. A resident of Massachusetts would consider themself a Massachusetts person and Massachusetts their country. Similarly, a Pennsylvanian would view Pennsylvania as their primary nation. Essentially, we have 13 distinct individual states united through an alliance operating under a central government with limited powers. This central governments function was to address issues beyond the capability of individual states. This concept of shared national identity, evolving alongside strong state loyalty, significantly influenced the founders approach to federalism. The Constitution, in their vision, served to define and restrict the federal governments authority. This emphasis on limitations reflected a desire to safeguard the autonomy of individual states, which many citizens viewed as their primary political identity. The concept of a supreme central government stems from the Constitution's supremacy clause. However, it's important to understand that this supremacy applies only within the federal government's designated areas of jurisdiction. The supremacy clause doesn't grant the federal government absolute power. Federal supremacy reigns in matters explicitly delegated to the national government, such as defense, war, foreign relations, and regulating interstate commerce. Conversely, the states retain control over a vast array of issues closer to home, including education, road construction, and local sales taxes. These spheres of influence are outlined, though not always definitively, within the Constitution. As we'll explore further, the lack of absolute specificity in defining these powers can lead to complexities. The United States was established as a federal republic. This signifies a system with two distinct levels of government, each possessing its own defined areas of authority or jurisdictions. The 10th Amendment, enshrined within the Bill of Rights, exemplifies this principle. It asserts that any powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people thereof. Federalism, as envisioned by the founders was a novel concept. Unlike traditional nation states with centralized power structures and subordinate provinces, the United States aimed to function as a cooperative union of individual states. This bears some resemblance to the European Union, where member states retain significant autonomy while collaborating under a central governing body. However, it is crucial to recognize a key distinction. Unlike the European Union, where authority is explicitly defined in its founding document, the American Constitution leaves some room for interpretation regarding the division of powers. This ambiguity, as we'll see, has led to ongoing debates and interpretations surrounding federalism throughout american history. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","In this segment we will consider the first two consequences of the great war for empire that contributed to the American Revolution. The first we will refer to as creole patriotism. After that, we will examine how british indian policy enraged Americans during the war. The british parliament enacted the Quartering act. This act mandated that colonists house and feed british soldiers stationed in America. Imagine the intrusion enjoying your Saturday evening at home when a contingent of soldiers demands entry and sustenance. The act was a clear violation of privacy. However, the issue went beyond mere practicality. It reflected a broader european attitude that viewed the Americas and everything within it as inferior. This sentiment wasn't unique to the British. Spanish and french colonists likely faced similar prejudices. A french naturalist, Georges Louis Leclaire Kont de Beaufort, even used a zoological comparison to illustrate this point. He contrasted the mighty war horses of Europe with the weak, passive deer of America. This underlying arrogance permeated all social classes and undoubtedly informed the behavior of british soldiers stationed in the colonies. They likely viewed the colonists as uncultured and backwards, ignorant Hicks. This disrespect would naturally breed resentment among the colonists. In response to this treatment, a sense of american identity distinct from british identity began to solidify. Historians refer to this phenomenon as creole patriotism, emphasizing the colonists'emerging sense of self and their growing attachment to their american home. Let's first clarify the definition of creole in this historical context. While the term is often associated with New Orleans, it has a broader meaning. Here, a creole is an individual born in the Americas whose parents emigrated from elsewhere, typically Europe. In New Orleans, this meant people of french descent born on american soil. Similarly, within the spanish colonies, someone born in the Americas to spanish parents would be considered a creole. In the british colonies, a large portion of the population would fall under this definition, as many were born in America with english ancestry. Fueled by british arrogance and their constant denigration of the colonists, the creoles began asserting a distinct identity. They countered arguments of american inferiority by highlighting positive elements of their society. They emphasized the abundance of land, cleaner environment, higher infant survival rate, and general prosperity they enjoyed. In contrast to Britain, this counterargument served as a turning point. The creoles began to view their differences not as deficiencies but as strengths. This shared experience of being looked down upon by the british fostered common ground. It sparked the emergence of a unified american identity, one that the creoles proudly embraced and defended. So why is this shift in perspective? Significant unity fosters strength. Remember, we're building towards the American Revolution, a fight for independence from Britain. How can a revolution for american independence occur without a unified american population. Recognizing their distinct identity from the British was essential. The british arrogance then inadvertently fueled this nascent nationalism we call Creole patriotism. It instilled a minimal sense of unity among the colonists, while regional identities remained distinct. A shared identity as American began to take root. This realization that they were fundamentally different from the British became a critical development in forging the belief that America could exist as an independent nation. Another consequence of the war was american resentment of british indian policy. Tensions rose between the colonists and the crown regarding westward expansion. During the war, colonists were motivated by the potential for acquiring land in the west. Many, in fact, were promised such land for their service. However, british policy postwar directly contradicted these expectations. King George II issued the proclamation of 1763 establishing a boundary line, the proclamation line that restricted colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. This restriction infuriated the colonists for several reasons. Firstly, they felt they had earned the right to westward expansion through their wartime contributions. Secondly, many colonists held promises of land grants in the very territories now declared off limits. This perceived betrayal by the crown fueled significant resentment among the colonists.

","In this segment we will, in brief overview, explore the beginnings of the First World war in Europe. The anticipation of a short conflict was disappointed by the facts of balance of power politics, setting the great powers of the world on a course of four years of bloody conflict. We will begin by assessing the two alliance systems. At the beginning of the war, the core alliance against Germany consisted of France and Russia. This partnership stemmed from both historical and geographical factors. France, having been defeated by the Germans in the 1870s, harbored animosity. Meanwhile, Russia felt threatened by Germany's increasing might and expansionist ambitions. They'd found common ground in a strategic alliance. If Germany were to declare war on either France or Russia, it would have to fight on two fronts simultaneously, a highly undesirable scenario. In response, Germany aligned itself with Austria Hungary, a long established empire controlling much of southeastern Europe and the newly unified nation of Italy. This bloc became known as the Central Powers, a self explanatory name reflecting their geographical position in Europe. Additionally, there was the neutral nation of Belgium. While declaring its non alignment, Belgium's strategic location made it a potential invasion route for Germany to enter France. To protect Belgium's neutrality, Britain pledged support, stipulating that if Belgium were invaded, Britain would enter the war. This pledge, combined with the existing alliances, formalized the counterbalance to the central Powers, known as the Triple entente, comprised of Britain, France and Russia. As tensions escalated in Europe, pre war planning proved crucial. All sides had meticulously crafted mobilization strategies in anticipation of a potential conflict. This period saw a significant shift in warfare, with industrialization leading to a more mechanized approach. Germany's central plan, the Schlieffen plan, aimed for a swift victory in the west. It called for a rapid invasion through Belgium by passing french fortifications and encircling french forces with a decisive offensive towards Paris. The swift capture of the french capital, it was believed, would knock France out of the war. Before Russia could fully mobilize on the eastern front, however, the Schlieffen plan had a critical flaw. Inflexibility. Once set in motion, the complex troop movements were difficult to alter. This inflexibility stemmed from the prevailing belief across Europe that any war would be short lived. Mobilization. The process of readying military forces for war was a cumbersome undertaking. Stopping mobilization midstream to de escalate tensions was simply not considered a viable option. As tensions reached a boiling point, Germany initiated mobilization, triggering a domino effect. This, in turn led to the invasion of Belgium and France. While german forces advanced quickly, their progress was ultimately halted. The decision to invade Belgium drew Britain into the conflict. Bolstering french defenses, the combined allied forces managed to stop the german advance just outside Paris, forcing a german retreat. The Schlieffen plan's ambitious goal of a quick victory in the west have fallen short. The initial failure of the Schlieffen plan led to a grueling four year stalemate. On the western front. The intricate system of alliances designed as a deterrent had backfired. The premise was that invading one nation meant facing its entire bloc of allies, making outright victory virtually impossible. Unfortunately, this premise proved accurate. While individual battles might see a decisive victor, neither side could achieve the overwhelming advantage needed to break the war's deadlock. This stalemate gave rise to the infamous trench warfare. Both sides entrenched themselves in vast networks of fortified ditches stretching from the North Sea to Switzerland. Attempts to dislodge the enemy resulted in horrific losses with minimal territorial gain. With conventional military strategies failing, both sides turned to a different kind of economic warfare. The goal was to cripple the enemy's ability to wage war by disrupting its economy and depriving it of vital resources. Economic warfare initially aimed to prevent trade with America's enemies. Hoping to stifle their ability to wage war, the British instituted a blockade of the North Sea and Mediterranean to restrict trade with the central Powers. Conversely, Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare, asserting the right to sink any ships found within a designated exclusion zone around the British Isles without warning. Essentially, Britain demanded that no one trade with Germany, while Germany demanded the same of Britain. This conflict directly opposed the United States insistence on free trade. As a result, the United States expressed disapproval towards both Germany and Britain. It's important to understand that the United States and Britain did not enjoy the close alliance that exists today. Many Americans still resented the British, recalling them as the former tyrannical power. They rebelled against her independence. Recall our discussion last week about the near war between the United States and Britain over Venezuela in 1894. Furthermore, these substantial irish american population held long standing animosity toward England, while German Americans retained a sense of loyalty toward their homeland. Consequently, America was not automatically inclined to side with the British. True neutrality persisted alongside internal divisions within the United States, with a significant portion of the population supporting each side of the conflict. President Woodrow Wilson favored supporting Britain in the war, primarily due to its alliance with France. Both nations shared a commonality with the United States in their democratic, liberal systems of government. This posed a dilemma since an alliance with Britain and France would also align the US with Russia, a nation possessing a starkly contrasting antiquated monarchy. Wilson's desire to promote the spread of democracy worldwide conflicted with the reality of potential wartime partnership with Russia, creating a reluctance to involve the United States in the conflict. This situation directly challenged the long standing principles of american foreign policy. Non interference in european affairs coupled with insistence on free trade. The United States found itself facing a difficult choice, abandon its commitment to free trade or intervene in european affairs. This dilemma sparked intense internal debate within the United States regarding potential war involvement. Understanding Wilson's perspective on the conflict is important. The war itself was fundamentally a struggle for global empire. Whether dominance would remain with Britain and France, or if the rising power of Germany would seize control. Either side fought for ideals of government. Be they democratic or monarchical, their objectives centered on imperial power. The United States, with Wilson at the helm, had different priorities. Empire building was not a concern. Wilson's focus prioritized the spread of democracy. Consequently, the United States would eventually become involved in the war, driven by motivations distinct from those held by the other belligerents. In upcoming discussions, we'll examine whether this pattern of divergent motivations recurs in later conflicts. In 1915, Germany sank the british ship Lusitania. Though british in origin, the Lusitania carried numerous american passengers alongside american war material. Germany's justifications stemmed from its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. This policy violated established rules of maritime warfare that required attacking vessels to offer merchant ships the opportunity to surrender. Traditionally, a warning shot would be fired across the merchant vessels, bouths, signaling an opportunity for surrender and subsequent capture or destruction if surrender was refused. Submarines, however, were inherently vulnerable when surfaced, surfacing to issue warnings exposed them to potential attack by even merchant vessels. Consequently, submarines would often attack without warning, a tactic widely condemned as a barbaric breach of wartime conduct. Keep in mind the concept of rules of war is largely a western construction. In its purest essence, war is the antithesis of rules. Nonetheless, the west effectively used Germany's violations to present a persuasive moral argument to sway american opinion. Britain seized this opportunity, launching a successful propaganda campaign targeted at the american public. Their goal was to shift sentiment in their favor, and they achieved it. Gradually, american opinion tilted towards supporting the British against Germany. In response to the Lusitania attack, President Wilson issued a stark proclamation of strict accountability. This meant that further violations of maritime warfare rules would trigger american entry into the war. Germany, while dismissive of the United States, recognized that the delicate balance of power could be irrevocably tipped against them by american involvement. As a result, they temporarily halted their unrestricted submarine warfare policy, thus delaying direct us involvement in the war. Wilson's 1916 re election campaign capitalized on this with the slogan, he kept us out of war. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","In this segment, we are going to explore America's role in the first world war and our entry into great power politics. We will begin by looking at the US relationship with Mexico during its 1910 revolution and how that reveals what we will call President Wilson's missionary diplomacy. It will also ironically set the stage for the United States Declaration of war in 1917. It's natural to associate this period with the iconic images of trench warfare and the harrowing experiences of soldiers on the western front in Europe. However, to fully understand the United States involvement in this era, we must turn our attention to a different aspect of foreign policy, specifically the situation in Mexico. This shift in focus allows us to build on our previous discussions on foreign policy populism and progressivism, highlighting a significant domestic political development. The splintering of the Republican Party due to progressivism this internal division within the Republican Party was initiated by Theodore Roosevelt, a highly popular figure who had firmly aligned himself with progressive ideals. In 1912. Disenchanted with President William Howard Taft's lackluster support for progressive reforms, Roosevelt sought to reclaim the presidency. However, his bid for the republican nomination was unsuccessful, prompting him to run as a candidate for the newly formed Progressive Party, also colloquially known as the Bull Moose Party. This move by Roosevelt ultimately led to the Republican Partys defeat in the 1912 election. The election of 1912 was notable not just for the fragmentation of the Republican Party, but also for the significant ideological shift that occurred within the Democratic Party. Woodrow Wilson, running as a Democrat, embraced a progressive platform, signaling a transformation in the partys stance. This election marked a critical turning point in american political history, where the traditional alignments of the parties on social issues began to shift. Prior to 1912, the Republican Party was predominantly viewed as the liberal party, especially in terms of social policies. However, the aftermath of the 1912 election saw the Democratic Party emerging as the standard bearer for liberalism. Woodrow Wilson's approach to foreign policy, often termed missionary diplomacy, signifies a distinctive departure from the interventionist strategies employed by previous republican administrations. Wilson harbored a profound belief in american superiority and the inherent virtue of the american way of life, which he saw as emblematic of manifest destiny. This belief underpinned his conviction that the values and principles guiding the United States were not only universally applicable but also universally desirable. In the era preceding Wilson's presidency, american foreign policy in Latin America was largely driven by imperialistic ambitions, with interventions frequently justified on the grounds of protecting american business interests. Wilson, however, diverged from this path, positing that while intervention for the sake of business was not in keeping with american ideals, intervention to foster democracy was not only justified but necessary. This philosophy of missionary diplomacy was rooted in the notion that the United States had a moral obligation or mission to spread democracy, liberty, and by extension, other components of liberal ideology, such as secularism and capitalism. The end goal of Wilson's policy was not merely the export of a political system, but the broader dissemination of a way of life that he deemed superior. Wilson's firm belief in the righteousness of this mission reflects a broader american ethos of the time, emphasizing not just the spread of democracy as a form of governance, but the broader propagation of liberty as a fundamental principle. Wilson's missionary diplomacy represents a nuanced form of interventionism, one that prioritizes ideological and moral imperatives over the economic or strategic interests that had typically motivated earlier interventions. This approach, while still interventionist in nature, highlights a shift in american foreign policy towards a more ideologically driven engagement with the world, specifically in promoting the values of democracy and liberty as universal ideals. As we approach 1910, Mexico finds itself in a curious position. Under the long rule of Porfirio Diaz and the influence of the scientificos, a group of advisors guided by positivism, the nation has achieved a degree of modernization. However, this progress has come at a cost. Deus has been in power for over three decades, his cabinet largely unchanged. This lack of political turnover draws increasing criticism both domestically and abroad. Further complicating matters is the impending centennial of mexican independence in 1910. September 16, 1810, marks the Greedo de Dolores, a cry for freedom that ignited the struggle against spanish rule. This momentous occasion presented an opportunity for Mexico to showcase its modernization efforts on the world stage. In anticipation, Mexico City underwent a significant facelift, with grand new architecture reflecting a sense of national pride. However, a key criticism persisted. Mexico's embrace of modernity hasn't extended to democratic reform. Diaz has long maintained that true democracy must wait for Mexico's modernization to be complete. Recognizing the need to address this growing concern, Diaz makes a calculated move. In the lead up to the 1910 centennial. He announces to the world that he will not seek re election. Attempting to portray this as a gesture of good faith and a commitment to eventual democratic transition, Francisco Madero, a wealthy landowner from northern Mexico with an education from the University of California, Berkeley, emerged as a leading critic of the regime. He capitalized on widespread public yearning for democratic reform by announcing his candidacy for president. Madero's campaign resonated deeply with the mexican people. The prospect of a genuine democratic election, a concept long suppressed under Diaz, ignited popular enthusiasm. However, as it became increasingly clear that Madero was likely to win a fair election, President Diaz resorted to authoritarian tactics. He ordered Madero's arrest, effectively derailing the electoral process. Undeterred, Madero escaped imprisonment and fled to Texas from exile. He issued a formal declaration known as a pronunciamiento. This document denounced Diaz's fraudulent election and called for an armed uprising to overthrow the dictatorship. The plan of San Luis Porosi, as it was later called, marked the official beginning of the mexican revolution, a bloody conflict that would engulf the nation for over a decade. The early promise of Madero's presidency was tragically cut short. A counter revolutionary movement emerged, led by General Victoriano Huerta. Huerta, a ruthless figure who embodied the very antithesis of democratic ideals, sought to restore the authoritarian status quo of the Diaz era. This counter revolution was fueled in part by the vested interests of foreign powers. As you'll recall from the film, Los foreign corporations, particularly american mining companies, had acquired significant land holdings and influence in Mexico. Under Diaz, this foreign investment generated substantial wealth, but the benefits largely flowed out of Mexico, enriching foreign companies while the mexican people remained impoverished. Unsurprisingly, these foreign investors had a vested interest in maintaining the stability and predictability of the Diaz regime. Consequently, several foreign embassies, including the american embassy, provided crucial support to Huerta's counterrevolution. This culminated in a ten day period of violent upheaval known as La decent. The ten tragic days. The conflict ended with the deaths of both President Mondeiro and Vice President Pino Suarez, leaving Huerta in control of the mexican government with the tacit approval of some foreign powers. President Woodrow Wilson's approach to Mexico stood in stark contrast to the actions of the american ambassador. Wilson, a strong advocate for missionary diplomacy, believed in promoting democracy abroad. He viewed Huerta's counter revolution as a betrayal of democratic principles and returned to the very dictatorship he opposed. Consequently, Wilson recalled the american ambassador and publicly denounce Huerta's regime. This left the revolutionary movement fractured, with two key opposition leaders vying for Benustianano Carranza and Pancho Villa. Carranza, the leader of the constitutionalist faction, aligned more closely with Wilson's vision for a democratic Mexico. Recognizing this, Wilson chose to back Carranza in his struggle against Huerta. President Wilson sought to actively support the mexican revolution, and an opportunity to intervene soon presented itself in the form of the Tampico affair. In this incident, a small american vessel was detained by mexican forces in the port of Tampico. The detention of the crew under a ship flying the american flag was perceived as a grave affront to american sovereignty. The United States demanded an apology and a formal 21 gun salute to the american flag from the mexican garrison at Tampico. Predictably, the Mexicans refused. This provided the pretext Wilson sought, and he ordered american troops to occupy Veracruz, a major port on the Gulf of Mexico. This strategic move targeted the customs house, the source of much of the mexican government's revenue. By cutting off this critical source of funding, Wilson effectively weakened the Huerta regime, contributing to Carranzas eventual victory. Following his victory over Huerta, Benustianano Carranza established himself as the new president of Mexico. A new constitution was drafted and ratified, attempting to restore stability to the war torn nation. However, this period of relative peace was shattered by the resurgence of Pancho Villa. Carranza and Villa, once allies against Huerta, became bitter rivals vying for control. While Wilson initially favored Carranzas constitutional government, the relationship between the United States and Mexico remained tense. One key source of friction was the lingering resentment over the american occupation of Bera Cruz. Carranza demanded us withdrawal, further straining diplomatic relations in this environment, Wilson continued a limited policy of supporting villa in the hopes of weakening Carranza. This precarious situation reached a boiling point in 1916, when Pancho Villa launched a daring raid across the border, attacking the american town of Columbus, New Mexico. Incensed by this act of aggression, Wilson ordered a punitive expedition into Mexico, a military operation aimed at capturing Villa. The punitive expedition proved a frustrating endeavor, failing to apprehend Villa and instead escalating tensions with the mexican government. The growing risk of a full blown war with Mexico on the eve of World War one forced Wilson to reevaluate his priorities. Recognizing the looming conflict in Europe, Wilson ultimately withdrew the American Expeditionary Force from Mexico. He prioritized american involvement in the global struggle over a protracted military intervention in Mexico. This decision marked a turning point in US Mexico relations, highlighting the competing interests and complexities that would continue to shape their relationship in the decades to come.

","In this segment, we will begin to consider how regional differences will shape America's selfidentification and the development of seeming contradictory policies throughout its history. The industrial revolution is said to have begun in England in the late 18th century, with some marking the opening of Arkwright's mill in 1767. As a beginning, however, the seeds industrialization were sown much earlier. Tracing back to the discovery of America, the industrial revolution will lead to a reordering of social, economic, and power relationships within countries and regions, and in relationships between regions. It will be the catalyst behind the modern age, leading to a concept and process known as modernization. As mentioned, the colonies in New England began mirroring England's trajectory. To understand modernization in this context, it must be considered as a multifaceted process. Industrialization played a crucial role, of course, but so did liberalization and capitalism. Liberalization here refers to a move towards more democratic governance structures often tied to the concept of popular sovereignty. Capitalism, as we've discussed, involves the shift towards a market based economy with private ownership at its core. New England's evolution toward modernization was not just economic, but also political and social, laying the groundwork for what we now consider modern principles of governance and economy reflect on the early differences between colonies in New England and the tidewater. These regions perceived each other almost as foreign lands, each with its distinct needs and outlooks. This initial divergence laid the groundwork for a nation that, while united in revolution against a common adversary, the British would emerge more as a federation of distinct entities rather than the monolithic country we envision today. When we think of the United States, we imagine a vast, unified nation with its capital in Washington, encompassing states from Ohio to California, Texas to Florida. However, the original conception of the United States was fundamentally different. It envisioned a collection of disparate countries, each with unique characteristics, united under a central government, primarily for purposes they couldn't manage alone, such as foreign policy. This setup foreshadowed a nation where regional differences often translated into rivalry rather than brotherhood. This inherent division prompts us to consider the outcome of such a relationship. Historically, it led to the Civil War, a conflict that in many ways was the inevitable result of the foundational differences laid in the 17th century. The United States was not formed as a single entity, but rather as a mosaic of diverse regions, particularly the north and the south, each with its distinct culture and economic priorities. As we navigate through american history, we encounter a recurring theme. The United States is characterized by diverse perspectives on virtually every aspect of its identity. Is America an economic powerhouse? Absolutely. A beacon of idealism, exporting a superior ideology? Indeed, can it be seen as an imperial predator? At times, yes. And is it a fountain of liberty? Certainly this duality, or rather, multiplicity of american identity underscores the importance of recognizing the United States as a nation of diversity. Add to these earlier differences the inclusion of citizens from all over the world, bringing with them wildly differing religions and cultural practices which weave their way into the american tapestry. This diversity has been a driving force behind the country's domestic and foreign policies, shaping its actions and reactions on the global stage.

","In this segment, we will consider an incident in colonial american history known as Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 within the colony of Virginia. This insurrection occurred pitting poor colonists against the landholding elite. Recall that we mentioned the development of a rigid, class based society in colonial Virginia. Nathaniel Bacon was a colonist in one of the lower echelons of Virginia society, but not the lowest. Bacon harbored ambitions to acquire land which brought him into conflict with the colonial government run by the upper level elite landowners. Governor William Berkeley had previously negotiated a pact with indigenous tribes, agreeing that settlers would refrain from encroaching upon native american lands in exchange for peace. Bacon perceived this agreement as antithetical to the interests of Virginia colonists who were eager to expand their territory. He believed the government was acting to protect its own interests and against the best interests of the colonists. Bacon mobilized both poor blacks and poor whites to challenge the authority of Governor Berkeley and the colonial elite. This coalition was significant as it demonstrated an early instance of cross racial collaboration in this early period. In colonial history, blacks and whites recognized their differences and were not integrated, but there was no latent sense of superiority or inferiority, and they could work together to pursue their common interests. We will see later in this course how this eventually became impossible. The rebellion itself was ultimately quashed by the colonial authorities. Following the death of bacon from disease, many participants were executed. In the aftermath, the House of Burgess, the Legislative assembly in Jamestown, enacted a series of restrictive laws targeting African Americans. These statutes, later known as the black codes, effectively decreed that individuals of african descent could not enjoy the status of freedom within the colony. They faced limitations on employment opportunities and were barred from providing testimony in legal proceedings. Notably, these oppressive laws did not apply to whites. The intended and inevitable outcome was a deterioration in the rapport between poor blacks and poor whites, fostering sentiments of superiority among the latter and resentment among the former. The strategic intent behind these legal measures was to prevent unity among the lower classes, thereby averting any potential challenge to the ruling elite. By sowing division based on the superficial characteristic of skin color and codifying it within the law, the colonial authorities ensured that poor whites would align themselves more closely with the elite. Despite greater economic and social similarities with African Americans. This calculated strategy laid the groundwork for systemic racial segregation in America, a phenomenon that had enduring implications. It is a sobering realization that the roots of racism in this country can be traced back to economic and power dynamics orchestrated by plantation elites in contemporary times. While there have been notable advancements with African Americans attaining high political offices, racial tensions remain and predominantly persist, especially within the lower socioeconomic strata, where the similarities are greatest. The historical precedent set by the elite during Bacon's rebellion continues to influence the perpetuation of privilege and the maintenance of authority. We must acknowledge the ongoing presence of white privilege within our society. The difficulty in acknowledging such privilege often stems from its invisibility to those who benefit from it, whereas those deprived of it are acutely aware of its existence. There are voices today who argue that racist elements of our past should not be taught to avoid discomfort among innocent students over the actions of their ancestors. Essentially, what they're saying is that white students should not be made to feel uncomfortable about race. In response, I would argue that black students have always had to feel discomfort about american history and that the discomfort by either black or white students arises from an essential acknowledgment of injustice. I think we should feel uncomfortable about damnable events of the past. I do. That is not to say that any of us should blame ourselves or our contemporaries for crimes committed by our ancestors, but that recognizing injustice will motivate us to work toward a more just present and future. Do not allow discomfort to deter your engagement with these critical issues. They remain integral to understanding the complex fabric of our nation's past and present.

","In this segment, we will discuss politics during the first years. Under the Constitution, the newly elected president will attempt to establish a unity government, only to be thwarted by cabinet members with vastly differing visions of what kind of nation the constitution created. We will see how the divisions in the first administration became the basis for american politics even into the present. George Washington was elected president, the first to hold this office. Without an established precedent for presidential conduct, Washington's leadership initially resembled that of a benevolent monarch. Let's consider the traditional role of a king. Theoretically, a king represents and protects his people, serving as a paternal figure. Washington, aware of his unique position, stated his intention to represent all Americans, not just those who supported him. Despite his widespread popularity, this would prove challenging. In forming his cabinet, Washington strategically selected individuals with divergent viewpoints. Alexander Hamilton became secretary of the treasury and Thomas Jefferson secretary of state. While once allies, their visions for America had grown increasingly distinct. Hamilton believed the Constitution established a strong national government capable of guiding the United States towards becoming a powerful commercial and industrial rival to Britain. Conversely, Jefferson envisioned a nation where citizens could enjoy peace, freedom, and autonomy on their land with minimal governmental interference. These deep seated differences sparked intense and often bitter debates between Hamilton and Jefferson within the Washington administration. This schism highlights two fundamentally opposing visions of America, a tension that persists in american politics today. We can frame this divide as a conflict between economics and ideology. On one side, Hamiltonians believed federal policies should foster economic might and national wealth. Conversely, Jeffersonians envision a government primarily focused on safeguarding individual liberties and rights, enabling citizens to pursue their own livelihoods with limited federal oversight. In the early years of the republic, these positions were seen as irreconcilable. Hamiltons supporters view Jeffersonians as dangerous radicals, citing Jefferson's own statements about the potential need for another revolution. Those following Jefferson saw Hamiltonians as cryptomonarchists, individuals intent on undermining the Constitution to reestablish a system akin to the british one they had fought to escape. Both sides feared a victory by the other would spell ruin for the nation, leading to an atmosphere where compromise seemed impossible. The ideological split we've discussed crystallized into the first american party system. Those who aligned with Hamilton became known as federalists. It's crucial to distinguish these federalists from those who supported ratification of the Constitution. During the ratification debates, federalists advocated for the Constitution, while anti federalists opposed it. In the first party system, federalists champion a strong central government with an emphasis on economic development, while those who followed Jefferson, now termed democratic Republicans, lean towards a more idealistic vision, prioritizing individual liberties. Let's outline their core beliefs. Federalists, including figures like Washington and John Adams, supported a robust central government, believing it essential for building a powerful commercial and industrial nation. Democratic Republicans such as Madison and Monroe argued that any strong government should exist at the state level, allowing states to counterbalance federal power or even withdraw from the union if necessary. Economically, democratic Republicans envision an agrarian republic. While many were indeed southern, their ideal was not the plantation system, but rather a society of prosperous, independent small farmers. A vision well explore further when we discuss the concept of yeoman farmers. While federalist support was concentrated in the commercially oriented northeast, democratic republican support predominated in the south but was not exclusive to it. The fledgling american republic emerged amidst a complex international landscape. The American Revolution had ignited a wider conflict between Britain and France, and both european powers sought to draw the United States into their orbit. Federalists, with their focus on economic prosperity, gravitated towards Britain, the dominant trading partner at the time. While they aspired to future competition with Britain, immediate economic interests dictated a cautious approach. Disrupting trade with Britain could be disastrous. Conversely, democratic Republicans, steeped in revolutionary ideals, felt a kinship with France. Witnessing the French Revolution firsthand, Jefferson even participated in it. They saw it as an extension of the american fight for liberty. They envisioned a global wave of revolutions overthrowing tyranny, and the United States, they believed, should play a role in promoting this cause. This stance stemmed from ideology, not economic considerations. The Democratic Republicans embraced a philosophy known as strict constructionism. They believed the Constitution explicitly outlined federal powers, and any actions not expressly permitted were prohibited. The first major test of this principle arose with Hamiltons financial plan. As treasury secretary, he proposed establishing a national bank and having the federal government assume state debts incurred during the revolution. This aimed to bolster the nation's creditworthiness. However, strict constructionists found no constitutional provision authorizing a national bank or federal debt assumption. To them, these actions were unconstitutional. Federalists countered this argument by invoking the elastic clause, also called the necessary and proper clause. This clause allows Congress to pass laws deemed necessary to to carry out its enumerated powers. Federalists asserted that establishing a national bank and assuming state debts, while not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, were actions necessary and proper for ensuring a sound and stable government. This fundamental debate, whether the Constitution is a fixed document or a living one adaptable to changing circumstances, persists in american politics. Originally, Jeffersonians advocated for strict constructionism. All Hamiltonians favored a looser interpretation. Today, the battle lines are less clear cut. Consider modern issues like same sex marriage, gun rights, and abortion rights. None are explicitly addressed in the Constitution, yet courts and lawmakers have rendered decisions based on their interpretation, demonstrating the continued relevance of this foundational debate. Having surveyed the debates at the constitutional convention and the difficulty in coming to agreement, we will notice that one of the strongest arguments in favor of so called strict constructionism in contemporary politics is based on a myth. That myth is that we should interpret the constitution based on the founders original intent. There is no single identifiable original intent to study historical records to try to find it reveals that each of the participants in the convention had their own intent. The intent of each state was distinct from that of the others. What this means is that proposals as to original intent represent more the intent of the interpreter than that of the founders.

","In this segment, we will examine probably the most well known consequence of the french and indian war. Taxation without representation. The war, fought largely in North America, had been a costly endeavor for Britain. It left the british government deeply in debt. Parliament believed the colonists who had benefited from british military protection during the war, should share the financial burden american colon this fiercely contested parliamentary attempts to tax them. This opposition stemmed from John Locke's concept of the social contract, a theory that heavily influenced the colonists'political thinking. According to Locke, government exists to protect individual rights, particularly property. People give up some liberties, like complete control over their possessions in exchange for the government's protection of the rest. This consent is crucial. The government's legitimacy hinges on its ability to safeguard its citizens'lives and property. The colonists readily paid taxes levied by their own colonial assemblies. However, they saw parliamentary taxation as fundamentally different. Since they lacked representation in parliament, they argued they had no say in how these taxes were levied or spent. In their view, this violated the social contract. The colonists weren't simply against taxation. The lack of representation was the key issue. Without a voice in parliament, they felt their consent was being bypassed. This, they argued, transformed taxation into theft. The government entrusted with protecting their property was instead taking it without their consent. Locke further argued that when a government violates the social contract by abusing its power, the people have a right to revolt. The colonists, viewing parliamentary taxation as a violation of their natural liberties, used Locke's philosophy to justify their growing resistance. This ideological foundation provided a powerful justification for the American Revolution. Americans in parliament fundamentally disagreed on the structure of the British Empire. Colonists envisioned a system where the king oversaw separate legislative bodies, each representing distinct territories. Massachusetts had its own assembly, Pennsylvania had theirs, and so on. Colonists believed only their locally elected assemblies could rightfully levy taxes on them. To them, parliamentary taxation equaled taxation without representation. The british view differed significantly. They saw parliament under the king's authority as the supreme ruling body of the entire empire. Therefore, parliament acted for the benefit of every british subject, whether directly represented or not. This concept, known as implicit or virtual representation, asserted that even without colonists in parliament, their interests were protected. Understandably, Americans rejected this argument. Implicit representation failed to acknowledge the lack of their direct voice within parliament. Decades of self governance during the era of salutary neglect further fueled their resentment. Colonists deeply believed that only through elected officials could they truly consent to taxation. The british insistence on virtual representation therefore became a symbol of tyranny in their eyes. Hence the slogan, taxation without representation is tyranny.

","In this segment, we will transition to the end of the colonial era and begin to look at the issues that would lead to the american revolution. Recall from our discussion on Locke's second Treatise of government that we explored the historical context surrounding his work. We did this to understand the issues that shaped his political philosophy. We will recall that in the 17th century there were two major mercies in english politics, religion and sovereignty. Monarchs in England up to Charles I had ruled by a concept known as divine right, which basically argued that the king received the right to rule from God. However, the parliament became more assertive during this period and pushed back against divine right, arguing that the right to rule derived from the people. This disconnect had led to the english civil War, after which the king was executed and England ruled as a commonwealth for about a decade. After the death of Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, the monarchy was restored by parliament, essentially establishing that the king ruled at the pleasure of parliament. However, Charles II and his successor, James II, still asserted divine right. King James II, a staunch believer in divine right, became deeply unpopular. His daughter Mary and her husband, William of Orange, led a rebellion against him called the glorious revolution. It was called glorious because there was little bloodshed and it reestablished parliament's right to rule. However, there was a lingering complication. James II fled England but never formally relinquished the throne. This led to internal political turmoil in Britain, which would have significant repercussions for its colonies in the following decades. This period is known as the era of benign or salutary neglect. Britain, in theory, remained the imperial power. This meant assuming responsibility for defending its vast territory, including the american colonies, the caribbean islands, India, and others. However, preoccupied with domestic political struggles, Britain largely neglected enforcing its authority in the colonies. As a result, the american colonies essentially governed themselves. This era of salutary neglect lasted from approximately 1689 until 1763. The latter year marks the outbreak of a conflict between Britain and France spilling over into the american colonies. The key takeaway is that England's internal political turmoil inadvertently fostered a tradition of selfgovernment in the american colonies. It's tempting to think of the pre revolutionary colonies as a nascent United States. However, this perception would be inaccurate. As we've discussed, colonists primarily identified with their specific colony, rather than a broader american identity. Imagine living in Massachusetts during this period. Your primary sense of belonging wouldn't be to a national entity called America, but rather to the colony of Massachusetts itself. This local identity extended to other colonies as well. A Pennsylvanian wouldn't consider themselves american, but Pennsylvanian. Similarly, Virginians wouldn't identify as american but Virginian. This localized identity was so strong that colonists might have viewed residents of neighboring colonies as foreigners. The analogy isn't perfect, but for us today it might be akin to Californians considering Arizonans as entirely other. While some regional rivalries exist in the US today, we all fundamentally share an american identity. This concept was absent in the colonial era. Local loyalties trumped any sense of a unified America. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","In this segment, we're going to consider some of the historical intricacies of slavery and racial perceptions within the United States and contrast them with those in other parts of the Americas. Our exploration will reveal that the institution of slavery and the construction of race were not monolithic but varied significantly across regions. This section augments some of the issues raised in the signed video. The color of money. Students educated in american public schools are taught about slavery in the United States, particularly the US south, and are left to assume that the characteristics of slavery in states such as Alabama, Mississippi, or Virginia were representative of the entire institution of slavery. However, this assumption fails to capture the unique nature of slavery in the United States, which was the only nation to sustain a self propagating slave population. Unlike other regions where the importation of new slaves was necessary for maintaining the labor force, the US slave population was able to grow internally. Race and slavery are two different topics. In the United States, slavery was race based, but slavery has existed throughout known history, and race is an invention of modernity. The word slave itself originates from the word slav, a group of people living in southeastern Europe who were recruited by the Ottoman Empire to serve as janissaries, technically slaves whose purpose was to protect the emperor and who enjoyed significant privileges. Race was invented by Europeans as a way to justify and reinforce their domination over other regions of the world, like the Americas. The british world developed a binary concept of race. This system hinged on the one drop rule, which posited that any african ancestry, no matter how distant, categorized an individual as black. A person was either black or white. In reality, there is no biological basis for racial categorization in human blood. Blood is a matter of chemistry, devoid of ethnic or geographical markers. The determination of racial identity was thus not a scientific endeavor, but one based on visual assessment. This led to complexities, particularly in the south, where the intermingling of blacks and whites sometimes resulted in offspring who could visually pass as white despite having black ancestry. In the early United States, the notion of privilege was reserved for a specific subset of the white population, primarily Anglo Saxon Protestants from England or Scandinavia. This exclusivity evolved over time as various immigrant groups arrived in America initially marginalized, these groups, including the irish, Germans, and later in the 19th century, Poles and Italians, gradually assimilated into the fabric of american whiteness and acquired its associated privileges. In contrast, in other parts of the Americas, racial classification operated on a spectrum rather than a binary. In societies with significant populations of indigenous peoples like Brazil, Mexico, or Cuba, a more complex hierarchy emerged. Here. Proximity to whiteness correlated with privilege and individuals could occupy various gradations on this scale. In a simplistic way. This perception can be illustrated by considering an ascending scale with pure whites at the top and pure Africans and Native Americans at the bottom. The gradations of color between the points leads to different categories of privilege. The system was represented in what are known as casta paintings. These paintings are essentially a form of social documentation that visually represent the complex system of racial classification that existed in Spanish America. They aimed to depict and categorize the various racial mixtures that resulted from the encounters between Europeans, indigenous peoples, Africans, and their descendants. The caste system labeled mixed race individuals with terms such as mestizos, indio and white, mulattos, black and white, and zombos, indio and black, each signifying different levels of societal acceptance and privilege. The racial caste system was not as rigid as in North America. People could move up the racial scale either by marriage or by payment, but no one could buy being pure white, and many of the most privileged positions in Spanish America were reserved for whites only. So we see that this false notion of ethnic blood was not confined to North America. The way slavery was approached in british and Spanish America was also different. In Spanish America, the brutal conditions often precluded the growth of a self sustaining slave population. Slaves were essentially used like we use machines today, like an automobile. They would be used as long as they were useful, but eventually they would be so broken they could no longer provide value, at which point they would be manumitted. Manumission is release from bondage. Some apologists will argue that slavery was more humane in Spanish America because there was a higher rate of manumission. But freed slaves in this case were essentially let loose to die. They were freed so the slave owner no longer had to bear their expense. Conversely, in North America, the cessation of the transatlantic slave trade after 18, seven incentivized slaveholders to encourage reproduction among their slaves, treating them akin to livestock to ensure a continuous supply. The writers of the Constitution included what we call the three fifths compromise, which allowed southern states to count their slave population for representation at the count of three for every five slaves. The compromise part was that the slave trade would be ended after 20 years. The assumption was that ending the slave trade would lead to the gradual demise of slavery because the slave population could not be replenished. Instead, what happened was that by the time of the Civil war, the slave population was increasing through natural reproduction. The assigned reading of the narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass is the story of one of these offspring. By situating the United States within the broader context of the Americas, we gain a better understanding of the complex interplay of race perception and slavery. At the same time, we must acknowledge that neither system of racial classification and neither practice of slavery were better. Both were vehicles of injustice, what President John Adams would call an evil of colossal magnitude. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","In this segment, we're going to look at the settlement of New England by Puritans and draw a sharp contrast to the class based and agrarian society of the Tidewater region. Events in the early 17th century in Europe and America would have far reaching consequences for the yet to be imagined United States. The Puritans were a group of people who emerged during a turbulent time in english history deeply influenced by the religious reform sweeping across Europe. We discussed in a previous lecture how Henry VI initiated the English Reformation, that his changes were more about asserting his control than overhauling religious doctrine. This was quite different from the Reformation on the european continent, which was characterized by significant doctrinal shifts and the emergence of new Reformed churches distinct from the Catholic Church. These reforms challenged the catholic view that salvation was mediated through the church and its sacraments. Instead, Protestantism, particularly in its Lutheran and Calvinist forms, emphasized direct access to salvation through faith in God, a faith strengthened by personal engagement with the Bible. In this image, we see a puritan on the left, an Anglican in the middle, and a Catholic on the right. According to Puritan belief, Calvinism, more radical than Lutheranism, found fertile ground in England even as it remained officially outlawed. Following Henry VI's break from Catholicism, there was hope among some english and scottish believers that the anglican church could be purified from within to reflect Calvinist principles. This group, seeking to implement Calvinist reforms within the anglican church, came to be known as the Puritans. However, as the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I made clear, the Puritans faced significant obstacles in their efforts to reform the church from within. Frustrated and seeking a place to freely practice their faith, many Puritans relocated to the more religiously tolerant Netherlands. Yet longing for a permanent home where they could establish a pure christian society, they secured a charter from the english crown to establish a colony in America. The expedition that followed was motivated by more than just the desire for religious freedom. The Puritans aimed to create a new society that would serve as a beacon of christian virtue and piety, what John Winthrop famously envisioned as a city upon a hill. This concept, drawn from the Bible, symbolized their aspiration to build a community marked by harmony, righteousness, and a close relationship with God. In essence, the Puritans'journey to America was not just a quest for religious freedom, but an ambitious endeavor to establish a model christian society reflective of their deep convictions and rigorous faith. When individuals ventured to New England, their underlying motivations starkly contrasted with those of the settlers who first made their homes in Virginia. The distinction lies primarily in the nature of these motivations, the initial settlers of Virginia were driven by economic aspirations. Their aim was clear, to amass wealth. Envisioning themselves as a group of english gentlemen poised to subdue a grand indian empire, they sought to extract wealth in a manner reminiscent of the spanish conquests in New Spain. This venture, fueled by dreams of riches, encountered a fundamental flaw. The anticipated grand indian empire did not exist, yet the pursuit remained fundamentally economic. In contrast, the colonization of New England was propelled by a markedly different vision. The settlers aimed to establish a city on a hill, a concept that envisaged a model christian society. This vision was deeply intertwined with the missionary zeal of these settlers. Inspired by New Testament teachings, they sought to create a society that exemplified the city of God on earth. Their ambition was to found a community so prosperous and divinely blessed that it would serve as a beacon, inspiring others worldwide to emulate their christian way of life. This aspiration was predicated on the belief that such a society, in living in harmony with divine laws, would attract global admiration and voluntary adoption of their christian ethos. This idea mirrors a biblical precedent, the jewish quest to establish a holy city in what is now Israel, governed by a society that flourished under God's laws, thereby attracting global allegiance to God. However, historical attempts at realizing this vision were thwarted by corruption within the church. The Puritans, in the wake of the reformation, perceived a parallel between their mission and the biblical narrative. They viewed the era's prevalent church corruption as a recurrence of past failings. Determined not to repeat history, the Puritans embarked on a mission to accomplish what they believed the early church could not. They positioned themselves as the new Israel tasked with establishing a new, pure christian society in New England. This ambition was not merely about founding another community. It was a profound statement of faith and a declaration of their intent to renew Christianity itself. The Reformation thus played a crucial role in shaping the Puritan's mission. It was a response to what they saw as the degradation of christian values and practices, a chance to rectify these missteps on new soil. The Reformation instilled in them a sense of divine purpose, reinforcing their belief in the possibility of creating a society that truly reflected christian ideals. The Puritans'journey to New England was therefore much more than a geographical relocation. It was a quest for spiritual and moral renewal inspired by the transformative spirit of the Reformation. When the Puritans set sail for America, their charter called for them to settle near the tidewater region. However, they veered off course and instead landed in what would later become known as New England, specifically at a place named Plymouth. In 1620, they saw their journey as a pilgrimage. A pilgrimage refers to a journey to a sacred place undertaken for religious reasons. For instance, Muslims are required to undertake a pilgrimage known as the Hajj to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. In a similar vein, the individuals who voyaged to America aboard the Mayflower were termed pilgrims. This is because their journey was also imbued with a religious purpose, aiming to establish a new life where they could practice their faith freely. Ten years following the pilgrims'arrival in Plymouth, another group of settlers arrived and founded what is now known as Boston. This second wave of settlers came aboard the arbella part of the Massachusetts Bay colony under the leadership of John Winthrop. It was Winthrop who famously articulated the vision for this new society with the metaphor of a city upon a hill. He said, for you must consider that we shall be a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us, so that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword through the world. This vision encapsulated the idea that the settlers were not just creating a new home for themselves, but were also undertaking a mission to build a model society. Winthrop's words reflect the deep sense of responsibility and purpose that guided the settlers, highlighting their belief that their actions and the society they built would be scrutinized by the rest of the world. This mission to create a shining example of a community founded on religious principles and ethical living, was a driving force behind the establishment of settlements in New England. It would later be reformulated with a vision more informed by the principles of the Enlightenment. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

32,"US1: 113 -The Social Structure of Medieval Europe: An Examination
","Introduction In this segment, we delve into the intricacies of medieval European society, focusing on the transition from the classical period, where individual contributions were prominent, to the medieval period, characterized by a more collective identity. We explore the concept of 'corporations' in medieval society, which were not business entities as understood in modern times, but rather distinct social groups, each with a specific role. The Three Estates Medieval European society was divided into three main 'estates' or 'corporations', each serving a unique function: 1. The Bellatores (Nobles/Aristocracy): Derived from the term meaning 'war person', this estate included knights and kings. Their primary role was protection, safeguarding the other two estates - the clergy and the peasants.      2. The Oratores (Clergy): Associated with prayers, this group played a crucial role in the spiritual realm. They were considered the mediators of salvation, a vital concept in medieval theology, which posited that salvation and entry to heaven were achievable only through the Church.      3. The Obradores (Peasants/Workers): Focused on agrarian work, this group's main task was to provide physical sustenance. They were responsible for food production, supporting themselves and the other two estates.      Society's Interdependence This societal structure created a balanced interdependence among the estates. Each group contributed to the welfare of the others, establishing a sense of unity and purpose. The nobles offered protection, the clergy facilitated salvation, and the peasants provided physical sustenance. Rigidity and Social Mobility The societal hierarchy was rigid, with little room for social mobility. Birth determined one's social class, with minimal opportunities for individuals to transcend their initial status. This rigidity contributed to the long-lasting stability of this social structure, spanning approximately a thousand years (476-1453 AD). Ideal vs. Reality It is important to note that this societal structure, while theoretically balanced, was more of an ideal than a practical reality. Over time, the gap between the ideal and the actual practices widened. By the 15th century, corruption was rampant among the nobles and clergy, with both groups exploiting the peasant class. "
33,"US1: 111 - Western History Timeline
","Introduction Welcome to our exploration of US history. To fully understand the roots of the United States, we must delve into the rich tapestry of European history. The cultural, political, and intellectual foundations of the United States are deeply intertwined with events that transpired in Europe long before the birth of the nation. This journey will take us through various epochs, highlighting the connection between past events and the emergence of the United States. The Importance of European History in Understanding the US The United States did not materialize in isolation. Its existence is a direct consequence of centuries of European developments. Recognizing this connection is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of US history. Choosing a Starting Point History is a continuous flow, like a river, and choosing a starting point for our exploration is somewhat arbitrary. For our purposes, we will begin our journey in Western Europe around the year 1500. This choice allows us to focus on the period and region most influential in shaping the ideas that would later form the United States. Understanding the Western History Timeline The timeline we will use focuses on Western history post-1500. It is important to note that this timeline pertains primarily to Western Europe and the Americas, acknowledging that other parts of the world have their unique historical timelines. Dividing Western History into Periods Western history can be divided into three main periods: 1. Classical Period: This era includes ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. It concludes in the year 476 AD/CE, marked by the sacking of Rome by barbarians. This date, while somewhat arbitrary, serves as a useful demarcation between the classical and the subsequent medieval period.      2. Medieval Period: Following the classical era, the medieval period extends until the onset of the modern era.      3. Modern Period: Contrary to popular belief, the term ""modern"" in academic contexts refers to the period starting around 1500 and ending in the mid-20th century. We currently reside in the postmodern period.      Rethinking History Beyond Dates and Names Our approach to history moves beyond the rote memorization of dates and names. Understanding the relationships and sequences of events is more crucial than recalling specific dates. The emphasis is on comprehending the broader context and significance of historical milestones.

34,"US1: 115 -The Renaissance, Reformation, and the Evolution of Individualism
","Introduction: The Renaissance marked a significant shift in Western society's perception of individual and societal roles. This lecture explores the consequences of this shift, focusing on the decline of corporatism and the rise of individualism, and delves into the pivotal religious transformations during this era. 1. The Decline of Corporatism and Rise of Individualism: During the Renaissance, there was a notable move away from the concept of corporatism, which divided society into three estates: nobles, clergy, and peasants. This structure was theoretically in place until the French Revolution but started losing its practical application earlier. The Renaissance ushered in an era where individuals began to be appreciated for their unique identities rather than just as members of a societal group. This shift laid the groundwork for modern concepts like popular sovereignty and democratic participation, where each person's voice contributes to governance. 2. The Role of the Estates General: The Estates General, a meeting of the three estates, highlights the limitations of the pre-Renaissance societal structure. Decisions like tax raises required the Estates General's approval, but with each estate having only one vote, the majority (peasants) often found their interests overlooked. This system starkly contrasts with the later-emphasized idea of 'one person, one vote.' 3. Religious Transformations and Martin Luther: The Catholic Church's dominance in spiritual matters was another aspect of life during the Middle Ages. Salvation was believed to be attainable only through the Church's sacraments. Martin Luther, a German monk, challenged this notion. Distressed about his own salvation and rigorous adherence to faith and good works, Luther turned to scripture. His interpretation led to the belief that faith alone, not the Church, was necessary for salvation. This doctrine was a significant deviation from the Church's teachings and contributed to the Reformation. 4. The Spread of Luther's Ideas and the Role of the Printing Press: Martin Luther's ideas, coinciding with the introduction of the printing press in Europe in 1453, spread rapidly. This spread was a medieval equivalent of going viral. Luther's intention was to reform the Church, not break it. However, his ideas inadvertently encouraged peasant revolts and a broader questioning of the Church's authority. 5. The Emergence of Calvinism and Predestination: John Calvin extended the Reformation's ideas. He introduced the concept of predestination, stating that salvation was predetermined by God before birth. This belief was notably influential among the settlers of New England, introducing new religious dynamics to the region. 6.The Counter-Reformation and the Council of Trent: In response to the Reformation, the Catholic Church initiated the Counter-Reformation, exemplified by the Council of Trent. This council, spanning over several years, aimed to address and rectify the abuses identified by reformers like Martin Luther. The Counter-Reformation led to significant changes within the Church, such as requiring clergy to reside in their assigned dioceses. Despite these reforms, a fundamental divergence remained: Catholics viewed the Church as essential for salvation, whereas Protestants believed in salvation independent of the Church. This disagreement fueled numerous conflicts and shaped the religious landscape of Europe. Conclusion: The Renaissance and Reformation were pivotal in shaping modern Western thought and society. The transition from a corporatist society to one valuing individualism laid the groundwork for modern democracy. Simultaneously, religious transformations, particularly the rise of Protestantism, redefined spiritual beliefs and practices, impacting both individual lives and the collective societal structure. "
35,"US1: 114 -The Fall of the Roman Empire and the Rise of the Renaissance
","Introduction: The lecture explores the transition from the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages, culminating in the Renaissance. The focus is on how the Western Roman Empire's fall contrasted with the Eastern Roman Empire's resilience, the latter evolving into the Byzantine Empire. This transition period, often labeled as the Dark Ages, witnessed a loss of classical skills and knowledge in the West, while the East preserved much of this heritage despite external pressures. The Byzantine Empire and Cultural Preservation: The Byzantine Empire, rooted in the Eastern Roman Empire, managed to maintain its Christian identity while culturally diverging from its Roman origins. During the Medieval period, this empire successfully preserved the knowledge and skills of the Classical era. In contrast, Western Europe experienced a regression, forgetting techniques such as building arches and domes, which were prevalent during the Classical period. The Loss of Knowledge: A key discussion point revolves around how societies lose knowledge over time. The professor likens it to modern scenarios where certain skills become obsolete or are no longer taught. The decline in education and practical application led to the loss of specific architectural techniques in the West during the Medieval period. The Ottoman Challenge and Scholarly Migration: The 15th century saw the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, facing significant challenges from the Ottoman Turks. This led to a gradual shrinking of the empire, culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The ongoing conflict and eventual downfall prompted many scholars to flee to the West, carrying their knowledge with them. This migration played a crucial role in sparking the Renaissance in Western Europe. The Renaissance: Rebirth of Classical Knowledge: The Renaissance, literally meaning 'rebirth' in French, marks the reintroduction of classical knowledge into Western Europe. This period significantly altered the social structure, challenging established religious and cultural norms. The influx of classical ideas and knowledge from the East played a pivotal role in breaking the church's monopoly over knowledge, leading to a broad reorientation of society. "
36,"US1: 112 -The Transformation of the Roman Empire and the Rise of the Middle Ages
","Introduction: This text is an academic exploration of a significant transition period in European history, focusing on the fifth century and the transformation from the Roman Empire to the Middle Ages. It aims to provide college freshmen with a comprehensive understanding of these historical events and their implications. The Division and Fall of the Roman Empire: In the fifth century (400s), the Roman Empire, which had been a singular entity, was divided into two distinct parts: the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being ruled by the same emperor initially, a crucial development occurred when the Western Empire separated from the Eastern. The Western Empire, theoretically based in Rome, actually extended to various regions, notably northern Italy. Conversely, the Eastern Empire was centered in Byzantium, now known as Istanbul. A pivotal moment in history occurred in 476 AD with the sacking of Rome by barbarians. This event marked a significant influx and invasion of barbarians from Asia into Roman territories. The allure of the Roman lands, rich and prosperous, proved irresistible to these migratory groups. They sought to capitalize on the wealth and infrastructure established by the Romans. This incursion eventually led to the barbarians overpowering most of the Western Empire, effectively eradicating Roman political authority. The Role of Government and the Rise of the Papacy: The core function of any government, including the Roman Empire, was to provide protection and essential services to its people, such as ensuring access to food, safety, and infrastructure like roads and public works. However, with the disintegration of Roman authority, these responsibilities fell by the wayside across the empire. The only institution with sufficient reach and structure to assume these roles was the papacy, the Roman Church. Consequently, the pope and the church began to exert political influence over much of Europe, a period now known as the Middle Ages or the Christian era. Cultural Shift from Classical to Medieval Period: The cultural landscape of Europe underwent a significant transformation during this transition. The classical period was characterized by high art, literature, painting, sculpture, architecture, and law. It celebrated human creativity and life on Earth. Despite the presence of social issues like slavery and poverty, the classical era emphasized earthly existence and enjoyment. In contrast, the medieval period, influenced heavily by the church, adopted a more religiously oriented cultural atmosphere. This era was marked by a focus on the afterlife, viewing earthly life as a temporary phase before eternal existence in heaven. This shift represented a major redirection in cultural consciousness and societal values. This historical overview highlights the profound changes that occurred in the late Roman Empire, leading to the establishment of the Middle Ages. The fall of the Western Roman Empire and the rise of the papacy not only altered political structures but also had lasting effects on the cultural and religious landscape of Europe. "

","It's hard to give a definitive answer about how the United States entered into the Great Depression and how the United States dealt with the Great Depression, because it still has a lot of effect on american politics today. And so there's different political viewpoints that speak about the Great Depression and the New Deal differently today. Generally speaking, the Democrats look to the new Deal as kind of a beacon and as a blueprint for government, and Republicans look at the New Deal as a slide towards socialism. Right. I'm going to. I'll actually, you'll probably figure out that I have a little bit of bias in that. But the main thing is to let you know that, that there is that argument that, that some people are still very much against the New Deal. I think that you may or may not remember the last speaker of the House. His name was Paul Ryan, right. And he said that since he was in college, it had been his ambition to dismantle the New Deal. Okay. So it really shows us that it's still something that's prevalent in american politics. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a kind of a 50,000 foot overview, an airplane view of it. I'm not going to try to go into the different things that happen because it's very complex. All right. But I think we can get a good feeling for how the Great Depression started by looking at this diagram that I made. Okay? Notice that the diagram is called the great debt balloon. All right? So I would mention to you guys that if you're going to take notes on this diagram, make sure you draw the balloon in there, okay? Because the balloon is going to be important. All right. Questions? Comments? All right. Let's think back then to the end of World War one. What was the document that ended World War one? The Treaty of Versailles. Versailles. Treaty of Versailles. Okay. Now, the Treaty of Versailles, as we mentioned last week when we talked about it, was ended up being a punitive treaty, right? Meaning that Britain, France were concerned to make sure that Germany was never able to threaten them again. And so they made punitive provisions in the document, like dividing Germany up, like taking away part of its industrial heartland and also imposing on Germany reparations. The argument was that Germany was forced to concede that they were fully responsible for the war, and therefore they should be fully responsible for paying for the war. The problem with that was a Germany wasn't fully responsible for the war. But the other part of it was that when they signed the treaty, what the treaty said was, okay, you owe us reparations. For the full cost of the war. But we haven't figured out what that is yet, so we'll let you know later. Right. We'll send you a bill. And they did. Right, but the problem with the bill was the bill was enormous, and it was meant to be that way because it was meant to keep the german economy crippled so that they could no longer threaten Britain and France. You guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? All right. Okay. Now let's think about the Treaty of Versailles. What was the american reaction to the Treaty of Versailles? You guys remember? Wasn't it. Wasn't it hard to ratify at first? Because the Senate didn't want it at first. It was at first. And. And also, what, forever, the United States never ratified. Yeah, that's. That's right. That's right. The United States didn't ratify the treaty of Versailles, which meant that the United States wasn't owed reparations by Germany because it wasn't part of the treaty. Right. And United States signed a separate treaty with all the different warring powers in the. In the. That the United States was at war with. Okay, but during the war, Britain and France had gone deeply into debt. Okay, the reason for this is because unlike what most people believe, that war is good for the economy. Actually war is terrible for the economy. And the reason why was because after about a year and a half of war, Britain and France ran out of money, and then they. But they still wanted to prosecute the war, and that meant they still needed to buy things to prosecute the war. And so what they did was they borrowed money. And where they borrowed the money from was in the United States. They didn't borrow money from the american government, but they borrowed money from corporations in the United States. You guys follow I'm saying here? All right, so what that meant was that at the end of the war, Britain and France were deep in debt to the United States, and Germany was deep in debt to Britain and France. Okay, you guys following here? All right, so now, because the United States had been allied with Britain and France, at the end of the war, Britain and France thought that the United States shouldn't. Shouldn't force them to pay their debts, but the debts weren't owed to the United States. The debts were owed to american corporations. And so that would be like. It would be kind of like me saying, well, I got a cousin that works at Capital one, so I shouldn't have to pay for my credit card. Right, but that's not how it works. Okay, and so Britain and France were forced to pay back their loans that they paid to the United States. Let me just mention here, right? We talked about how many people believe that war is good for the economy, right? But what had happened was that Britain and France had invested huge amounts of money in war material. What's wrong with that? You can only use it for war, right? You use it for war, and then what happens to war material, generally? It gets destroyed. Right? I mean, that's the whole point of war, is to break things, right? So the point here is that Britain and France are investing huge amounts of money on stuff that's going to be destroyed. Okay? It would be kind of like if you decided to go down to Mission Valley and buy an escalade, right? Borrow, say, $50,000 to buy an escalade and then drove the escalade off the end of the pier, right? At the. At the end, you wouldn't have an escalade, but you would have, what? A debt, right? You'd have a huge debt that you had to pay for something that no longer existed. So that would be very much like taking your money and putting it in a trash can and lighting it on fire. You see what I'm saying? And that's the problem then, with the idea that war is good for the economy. War is always bad for the economy because war destroys the national resources. Okay? The only people that war is good for, our arms merchants, essentially, right? Arms merchants make a killing. People that can make money off selling people selling things to people that are making war will make a killing, literally and figuratively. But the country itself will always go into debt. So the economy never, I should say the country never benefits from going to wars. Always. It's always bad news. Right? Economically. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, so, all right, at any rate, we have Britain and France owing huge amounts of money to the United States, and we have Germany owing huge amounts of money to Britain and France. And Americans insist that Britain and France have to pay up. So Britain and France then will insist that Germany has to pay up. Okay? The one thing about this whole situation is that all of the industrial economies in the world, except the United States had collapsed, right? So Britain and France didn't have any money and they didn't have any way to make money. Germany didn't have any money and it didn't have any way to make any money. Essentially, all the money in the world was in the United States, okay? And so Britain and France say to Germany, you better pay up or else we're going to invade Germany? Germany doesn't have any money. Doesn't have any way of making any money. So if you owe a debt and you don't have any money, what do you do? They print more money. Well, printing money doesn't work. They did that. That's what they do, though, print. Printing money doesn't work. So if you're really going to pay back what you owe, then how are you going to get the money? We can't rob a bank. Right? You have to get loans from other countries. Okay? You have to get loans. Now, in this scenario, if I'm Germany, who am I going to borrow money from? The people with all the money. The US? The United States. Exactly. And what happens is that the United States passes laws making it legal to lend money to Germany. So the United States corporations are lending money to Germany, who are paying reparations to Britain and France, who take that money and pay it back in war. Loan payments to corporations in the United States. So corporations in the United States are making a killing because they're getting interest on the loans to Germany and interest on loans to Britain and France. You guys are all with me. Questions? Comments? Okay. And the reason why this works is because of the bull market. All right? Now, what does that mean? A bull market is when the prices on the stock market continue to rise. Okay? The prices on the stock market continue to rise. Well, what does that mean? And just bear with me here for a second because I want to try and draw a picture for you guys, okay? So when you're thinking about the stock market, there's two different numbers that you think of. You think of price and value, and price is what the stock, what you're willing to pay for the stock value is what the stocks actually were. And what we're going to do is we're going to look at the price and value of stocks on the american stock market over a period of time, which is the 1920s. So we're going to do that with a graph. This is going to be the money going up, and then going this way is going to be time. So we could say, okay, starting in 1920, and we're just going to put a couple other dates here, 1927 and 1929. So now, over this period of time, we see the price of the stocks going up and up and up and up until about 1927, then it's going to level off. But at the same time, we're going to see the value of the stocks increase, but at a much lower rate. And the significance of this is that the people are paying more for the stock than it's actually worth. Why would you do that? Well, it's because of enthusiasm. That's why they call it a bull market. It's not based on science so much as it is on what people's expectations are. So the expectation is that the price is going to keep going up and up and up and up. But in about 1927, people realize, wait a minute, we're paying way too much for this stock, and then it'll level off. And then in 1929, there is what's called a market correction, where the value moves to equal the price. And so what happens then is that now the price and the value of the stock are the same, but the stock was overvalued, so that the money that people, that was represented for people in the stock is going to disappear. So, professor, sorry to interrupt, but the top line is the price, and the bottom line is the value of the stock. Right. Price and value. Okay. And so the idea here is that they're paying more for the stock than it's actually worth. I don't know if you guys remember in 2008 with the housing crisis, the problem with the housing crisis was that people were paying more for the houses than they were worth. When it became obvious that that was happening, the price of the houses dropped to equal the value, which meant that a lot of people's money that had been invested just disappeared. Now, think about when we watched that movie about the twenties, and we heard they were talking about investing on margin. What is investing on margin? Well, essentially what it meant was if you wanted to buy a certain amount of stock, you would only have to pay for 10% of that stock. So let's say you wanted to borrow, you wanted to buy $1,000 worth of stock, you would only have to put up $100. Well, why would that work? Well, the reason why that would work. Well, first off, let me just ask you this. On the day that you purchased that stock, you would get a stock certificate saying that you had $1,000, but you had only put up $100. So how much real value do you have? Dollars worth of stock? No, because if somebody calls that stock, oh, $1,000 with a stock. But the price is only 100. Right. So how much money do you actually have? A $1,000. No, that's what it looks like you have. But what you really have is a 10th. Like a 10th of whatever the value is. No, it's minus $900. You are in debt, right? Oh, because you're really buying a loan, basically like a short term loan. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. And so what happens then? The reason why that works is if the price keeps going up, eventually the price will match the value of the amount of money that you actually paid, or that the face value of the stock, let's put it that way. And then after that, anything you make is profit. But the day that you buy it, you're not actually buying stock, you're actually creating debt. You really owe money. So let's just leave it at that. And let's keep this in mind. All of this money, between the price and the value, much of what is not real, it's really representative. It's representing debt. All of this money, when the stock market crashes, so to speak, the market correction causes the price and the value to equal each other, all that money disappears. We were just talking about was a bull market, right? Remember we said that all the money in the United States was in United. All the money in the world was in the United States at the money that was in the United States. Much of it was there because of the bull market. And the bull market meant that prices kept going up and up and up and up. What happens if the prices. What happens if the market changes from a bull market to a bear market? Bear market is when the prices are going down, meaning that people are losing money. And what that really meant was all of that imaginary money that was there is no longer there. So what that means then, is that the system here relies on there being money in the United States that can be loaned to Germany, that can be paid to Britain and France. It can be paid back to the US. But if there isn't any money in the US, then this whole system collapses. Right? You follow what I'm saying here? And that's why I call it the great debt balloon. Because the bull market is the fire that's keeping the balloon inflicted and floating. But that's an. It's hot air, it's not real. And when the bull market, when the fire goes out, the whole thing collapses. Okay. This money that was being invested, that was being loaned, right. Was mostly by banks. Okay, where does the bank it? It's money investors. American investors, depositors, right. So let's say that I have a put it in the bank, and then the bank pays me interest so that they can use my money, and they take my money, my hundred dollars, and they buy $1,000 worth of stock, and they loan that because it looks like now they've got $1,000. So they loan that to Germany. Right? And so what we see then is that most of this money isn't real. What happens when the balloon crashes? What happens? Does the bank have enough money to pay off all of its debts? No, no, it lost all that money. Right? So it's. It actually has said that it had more money than it actually did. And Americans aren't stupid. They realize, okay, look, the banks have been reckless with my money. I better go down and get it. And so they had what they called runs on the bank, right? People would run down to the bank and he'd stand in line and take out all their money. Okay, but what happens if you're the guy that's in line behind the last guy that gets money? Don't get any money. You don't get any money. The technical term for that is you're screwed, right? Because if you don't get any money, you're just out of luck. There isn't any place to turn. It's all gone. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay. And this is going to be then that what this is going to do is it's going to cause a lot of people to lose any kind of savings that they may have had, which was the only safety net there was in the United States at the time. If you were out of money, you couldn't go on welfare, right? You. You were just out of luck. Okay, you get what I'm saying here? And this is going to be what causes a lot of people to decide to move. They're going to say, I can't make any money here. I got to go somewhere else. Let's go to California. You get what I'm saying? Right? Okay. So now let's say then that the bank doesn't have any money, the banking system essentially collapses, right? Well, how's that going to end up causing a great depression? Well, the reason why is because manufacturing relies on the banking system. If you're going to. If you're a manufacturer, it's kind of like farming, really. If you're a manufacturer, then you go to the bank and you borrow money, and then you use that money to hire workers and to buy machinery and resources. You build a product, and then you sell the product, and then you take the money that you got from selling the product, you pay back the bank, and then anything left over is your profit. Okay, but where does the whole cycle start? The whole process started at the bank, right? The manufacturers go to the bank for what? What do they go to the bank? To get capital, right? And if the banking system collapses, that means there is no capital, right? If there's no capitalism, you can't. Excuse me, if there's no capital, you can't have capitalism. You can't have capitalism without capital. You guys get what I'm saying here? That if there's no money in the economy, you can't anything, you can't manufacture anything. And because of that, then there's going to be high unemployment, right? You guys are following me here. And let's go even further than that, because we've already said that all of the industrial countries of the world had collapsed, right? And when those economies collapsed, do you guys remember us talking about dependency theory in when we talked about imperialism? What is dependency theory? Is it like some countries are dependent on others for resources and capital? Right? Exactly. There's two groups of countries, the metropolis and the periphery, right? The metropolis is a monarch country and the periphery is colonized economies, right? And when the economy of the metropolis collapses, what happens to the economy of the periphery? They also collapsed because they were dependent on the metropolis. Exactly. That's why they call it dependency. Okay? And so we see then the entire world, capitalist economy collapses, all right? And really, this was a death blow to capitalism, right? Capitalism essentially is dead everywhere. Okay? But now let's think about this. There's one country, one major country in the world where the economy didn't collapse. Anybody want to guess where that is? Well, what country do you think is not a capitalist? No. United States, Russia, the Soviet Union. Exactly. Because remember, the Soviets have had a communist revolution, so they're not in a capitalist. They're not in the capitalist system anymore, right? Okay, so what will happen then is that capitalism essentially is dead and the Soviet Union's economy didn't collapse. The Soviet Union will use that as a propaganda tool to say, look, socialism really works because our economy didn't collapse even though all the capitalist economies collapsed. You guys follow what I'm saying here? But there's a big problem with that. And the big problem is that the economy in the Soviet Union didn't collapse because it had already collapsed during the revolution and it never recovered. Right? And so when they said our economy didn't collapse, it didn't collapse because it couldn't collapse. There was no place for it to collapse to. It was already dead. Okay, all right, but what will happen then is many people in the rest of the world will start to say, yeah, you know, socialism might not be such a bad idea. People like, for example, opt in Sinclair, right? And other people like W. E. B. Du Bois, who we talked about. All right. Will start to say, look, maybe. Maybe socialism is not such a bad idea after all."

","It. Now let's think about the history of the United States from the time that Frederick Jackson Turner wrote until, say, today or the last part of the 20th century. And what we'll notice is that this sense of mission that drove the Americans really was with Americans all the way up until the time or during World War II. And World War II seemed to be the fulfillment of the american mission, because the Americans came to the rescue of democracy and liberty throughout the world and emerged from World War II as the most powerful and most prosperous nation on earth. And so it seemed there for a moment that the United States had really reached the pinnacle of its own sense of mission. But World War II also opened up a lot of old wounds in american society that will challenge american society from then, really, for the rest of the century. Among those are going to be civil rights and gender rights and things like that. That will come up. And also the United States abandons its policy of isolationism and takes on a leading role in the world as the world's really the first, what we call superpower, and will enter into a long conflict with the Soviet Union in what's called the Cold War. And as part of that cold war, the United States. Well, I should say it this way, the United States sees itself in the Cold War as the defender of liberty, as the defender of democracy. And that goes along with the american sense of mission, that the american sense of mission is not only to spread democracy, but to defend it. And communism, from the point of view of Americans, is not democratic. So it's actually antithetical, and it is actually theoretically as well as practically. All right, so then the United States then engages in the world in different places. The United States engages in Korea, for example, because the Soviet backed North Koreans invade South Korea, who was an ally of the United States. And that was kind of an extension of the Cold war, of the cold War. And we see the same kind of thing happening in Southeast Asia with the French, except that the French were not really fighting against communism. They were fighting to maintain their empire in what happened. And they were at war there for a long period of time. And it was devastating. It was very costly to the French, but they were able to convince the Americans that it was also part of this cold war. And so the Americans started to back the French, and then when the French were finally driven from Southeast Asia, the Americans stepped in in their place. So really what we saw happening was that the United States assumed responsibility for a war, in theory, in favor of defending democracy, but what was in fact a colonial war that was trying to perpetuate the french empire, essentially. Right? So from the point of view of the people of Vietnam, the american intervention wasn't an intervention that was going to save democracy. It was an intervention that was going to perpetuate colonialism. And so the Americans were unpopular basically, with almost everybody in. So when we look at, for example, the history of the United States, when the United States goes to Vietnam, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was almost unanimously adopted by the house. And the. So we can see then that when Americans went to Vietnam, they went there with this idea that this was a good thing, that this is what was their mission, to defend and spread democracy. But as time goes by, and not that much time, we start to realize. Americans start to realize that what the United States says it's doing is not what it's actually doing. United States isn't defending democracy. United States is just basically propping up a regime that can't survive. Okay. And what makes this even worse is that the United States relies on a draft, meaning that everybody that's graduating from high school, basically the 18 year olds and up, are subject to the draft. And it doesn't take long for them to realize that being drafted and being sent to Vietnam isn't patriotic, or at least it doesn't seem patriotic to. So there will be a mass anti war movement that will eventually lead to the whole population, eventually will become pretty much anti war. Okay? Now what we really see then is that the turmoil of the 1960s will lead to the. Well, Carter calls it melee. It will lead to the melee of the 70s, meaning that with the loss of the Vietnam War and with the Watergate and some of the cultural things that happen in the early part of the 70s, America will lose its sense of confidence in itself in many ways. Right? So if we look back at the beginning of the 1960s, the Americans were convinced that they were at the forefront of history and that they were the good guys and what they were doing was. Right. But by the time we get to the middle of the 1970s, Americans are questioning their role in the world. A lot of other people are as well. Right. And you can see that then in the national consciousness that Americans start to question whether or not this idea of defending liberty, expanding liberty, is something that Americans should be doing. If you are a young scholar at this period of time, you go to college and you get your graduate degree and you start to study. But you're now studying from a different ontological outlook from the one that Frederick Jackson Turner had, because Frederick Jackson Turner lived with an ontology of the ever expanding progress of the United States. And now the scholars of the 1970s are going to be questioning that and now have a more negative view of american expansion. And that becomes kind of manifest in a book that was written. It was published in, I think, 1983, and it's called the Legacy of conquest by Patricia Limbrick. And what this book does is, as it says here on the screen, it rejects the Turner thesis, and instead it describes what happened in the west as a kind of a crime, that the Americans, driven by the profit motive, go into the west and they basically destroy things, ruin the environment, kill people, take over whatever they want, and it's all in the name of profit. So this is a very different outlook, obviously, than what Frederick Jackson Turner had. This is a much more critical happen. This is kind of the first of a series of different works that come from this period of time that will question or try to, I guess you could say, reinterpret our understanding of what happened in the west. And so this group of historians will be called the historians of the new west. The new west. Okay. It's not that the west actually changed. All the things that happened in the west have already happened. They don't change. But the way that we tell the story of what happened has changed. And what caused that change in the way that we tell the story. It wasn't that the events themselves changed. It was that we changed. So what's ontological then, is ontological on who we are, and then that informs how we're going to look at events that happened in the past and in the present. Okay, well, why is this important? Well, the reason why it's important is that we look at Frederick Jackson Turner's writing, and we conclude that his ontological outlook is of an expanding american progress. And then we look at Limerick's writing, and we say that her writing is also a manifestation, but this is of a kind of an America in decline, in a way. Right. What that means then, is if we try to understand why Turner wrote what he wrote and why people in the 19th century did what they did, but we do it from an ontological outlook that's our own and not theirs. We can't understand it. We can't see it. We can only see our own judgment of it. Okay, so the challenge for historians is to essentially try to put ourselves in the shoes of the actors of the time. That doesn't excuse what they did. We can look at, for example, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington owning slaves. We can't condone them owning slaves, but we can understand why they thought it was okay to own slaves, not why we don't think it's that way. We're not going to change our mind about that, but we can understand why they thought it was okay. You follow? So that's the importance of what's ontological. We have to understand the point of view of where the author is coming from or where the actor is coming about. Okay. Well, Frederick Jackson Turner paints this picture of this american progress, expansion into the west, and Patricia Limerick paints this picture of american conquest, of american greed. And which one of these is true? And the answer is, both of them are true to a certain extent, and both of them are false, but they're only true in their own ontological, um, context. And they're. And they're false in in a different ontological context."

","Last thing before we're done here is the war of 1812. Now, you'll remember that there was a war between the British and the French that eventually becomes the napoleonic wars. And the napoleonic wars embroiled the continent of Europe. And what happens is that the great strength of the French is their army, and the great strength of the British is their navy. And the problem is that you can't defeat an army with a navy, and you can't defeat a navy with an army. What ends up happening is that this war in Europe becomes a stalemate. That the French control the continent of Europe and that the British control the seas. So the British establish a blockade around Europe and say, nobody can trade with France or anybody on the continent of Europe, okay? And then Napoleon says, nobody on the continent of Europe can trade with anybody not on the continent of Europe. Okay, well, who's anybody? Arrogant United States. Remember, the United States is a trading country. And if you'll recall from Washington's farewell address, Washington had said, we don't really care about what's going on in Europe, but we insist on the right to trade with whoever we want. So we have both the French and the British trying to keep the Americans from trading. Right? The difference is that the french fleet was destroyed in 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar, and so the British control the seas. And what will happen is that the British will start to what they call impressive american sailors. They'll interdict american commerce on the seas, and they'll impress american sailors. And impressment doesn't mean, look how big our guns are. Aren't you impressed? Right? It means that they were forced into service. And what the British are going to say is that Americans aren't really Americans, they're really british. And because they're really british, they can be forced into service. Okay? And so what will happen is that the British will seize the american goods and they'll take the american sailors and send them to East Asia. So if you ever heard the phrase I've been shanghaied. Right, but that's. That's what. That's what it means, that Americans would be sent to Shanghai. And the reason why was because it was so far away, they would never be able to come back. Right? Okay, so. So this is going to be. This is going to present an enormous challenge to the United States, because the United States really doesn't have a military. It doesn't have a navy. It has a navy, but it's not very big. Right? It's nothing compared to the british navy. But the american economy is suffering. Okay, so now, one of the ways that the Jefferson administration is going to try to. That's what I'm looking for. One of the ways that the Jefferson administration is going to try to end this intervention is by declaring an embargo, a non importation act. The idea, essentially, that we're not going to import anything from Britain. And then later he's going to pass what's known as the Embargo act, which is basically not going to trade. But the problem, of course, with that is that american economy depends heavily on trade. Even in the south, where they grow cotton, they need trade in order to be able to sell their cotton. So this is going to be a very unpopular move, and it really doesn't affect the British at all. And eventually, then Jefferson will leave office after two terms, following the precedent set by Washington, and his secretary of state, Madison will become the next president, and he'll repeal all these acts. The problem is that these acts didn't really have any effect on the british intervention in american commerce. And so by. By 1811, Congress is going to, just like it says here on the slide, is going to authorize a military buildup. And then in 1812, the United States declares war on. On Britain. Okay, now here's what we're going to know. That you may have heard the phrase before, hawks and doves. Okay. Hawks and doves was big in terms in the dialogue of the 1960s when they were talking about the war in Vietnam, because the Hawks were the ones who were in favor of the war. The doves were the ones who were against the war. And here we see that this is where that term really comes from. The people who are in favor of the war called war hawks, and they're going to be mostly southerners and westerners. Right? Why? Because they see the war with Britain as an opportunity to gain territory. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay. The federalists and people in the northeast are going to be against the war. Why? Well, mostly because they're trade. They depend on their trade with Britain. Okay, so. So we see then that. That even though the United States has declared war, part of the United States is really against the war. Okay, you guys follow me here. All right, so now here's what's going to happen when the war starts. It's going to go badly for the United States, obviously, from the, from the very beginning. Right. But then there's going to be some. Some activity in the west where the British are going to be stressed. They're actually going to be. You're going to be losing the war. Let's put it that way, right. And the result of that then, is that the people in New England, the states in New England, are going to be concerned that the British are losing the war because they're still trading with the British over the canadian border. You follow me here. All right, so they were not only traders, but they also may have been traitors, right? Because they wanted to continue that trade, and they were afraid that if the Americans were able to take Canada, that would end their trade with Britain. You follow me here? And so what happens is that the governments of these New England states decide to pull their troops out of the war. Now, the reason why this may seem odd is because during this period, the US military wasn't like it is now. It wasn't like a centralized military made up of people from all over the place. It was a military that was. That was hobbled together by troops sent from the different states. So at the beginning of the war, the federal government says, okay, Connecticut, you got to send this many troops. Massachusetts, you got to send this many troops. And then they would put them together. It's the same way it was in the civil war, too, right? The idea that each of the states had their own army under their own command. And that was why, during the war of 1812, the New England states could pull their troops out of the war. And they went so far as to negotiate a separate peace. Right? And they came together at a place called Hartford, Connecticut. There was a convention at Hartford, and they said that if the United States didn't make war. Excuse me, make peace with Britain, that they were going to secede from the Union. Wait a minute. When we think about secession, what states do we think about? Do we think about Massachusetts seceding from the Union? What states do we think about? The south. The South. Exactly. But here, the very first threat of secession comes from the northeast. And what does this tell us? It tells us that that question of whether or not the states can leave the union is still open. It's an open question. What's the answer to the question? Well, the crisis here is going to pass. So New England doesn't try to secede from the union at this point, but we see this as one of the options that many states still think is legal. Why do they think it's legal? What does the constitution say about secession? Nothing. Exactly. Now, remember when we talked about constitutional convention and we said that certain things were left unresolved? Why would the constitution say nothing about secession? When the constitution was written, certain things were left unstated. And why were they left unstated? What would have happened if they had said, okay, no states can secede from the union. And if you're from a state that is very jealous of your. Your state authority, would you be likely to go along with that? No. No. No. Okay, but now, if you're from a state that thinks that the union is actually creating a bigger country and the constitution said, well, anybody can leave the union if they want, would they go along with that? No. Okay, so if they decided one way or the other, what would have happened to their ability to agree on the constitution? There wouldn't have been an agreement. There wouldn't have been an agreement. Okay, so certain things, particularly these two things, were left unstated. The supremacy of the federal government and whether or not the states can leave the union. Okay, they were left unstated because if they had tried to define it, then they would not have been able to agree. Okay, but the problem, I mean, that means that the constitution is put into effect. But the problem is that those questions remain. And we're seeing it here now in 1813, where New England political leaders are saying, well, we can secede from the union. Right? Well, what says they can't? Nothing says they can't. You guys get what I'm saying? All right, so at any rate, the point here then, is that this is a question that's going to continue to haunt the United States until the civil war. The civil war will effectively end it, although the argument is still being made. In fact, I read this morning that several attorneys general of republican states are suing the Biden administration in court over the COVID relief plan, saying that the COVID relief plan violates the rights of the state. Okay, so we'll see how that plays out. But anyway, the point is, it's something they still argue about even today. Right? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, well, here's what happens. Almost done here, guys. Here's what happens is that in 1814 is a bad year for the United States. Britain is going to invade Virginia and Maryland. And in fact, they'll land troops and they'll burn the White House. Right? So when President Trump accused Justin Trudeau of burning the White House, he was only off by a little bit because it wasn't the Canadians, it was the British. But at any rate, the White House will be burned, and then there'll be a large fleet that will be sent to take Baltimore. But there's a fort outside of Baltimore called Fort McHenry. And that fort had to be taken in order to be able to land troops in Baltimore. Baltimore. And then what happens is that the British are going to bombard that fort throughout one night. And it so happens that the people of Baltimore have made a huge flag, a huge american flag, that they're flying over the fort at Fort McHenry. And the bombardment lasts all night. And from the deck of one of the british ships, there's going to be an american doctor named Francis Scott Key who is actually watching all night long. And in the morning, the flag is still flying, and the British are going to withdraw. Okay? And so Francis Scott Key writes a poem about the battle. Does anybody want to try and guess what that poem's name is? Star Spangled Banner. The Star Spangled Banner. Right? Oh, say, does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave? Right? All right, so when you go to the baseball game or the hockey game or whatever, you go to. And they start singing the national anthem at the beginning, they're singing about this battle, all right? Because later what will happen is that they'll take the verses of Francis Scott Key's poem and put it to the tune of a scottish drinking ballad, and it'll become the american, uh, national anthem. At any rate. Uh, so. So at any rate, the Americans. The. The British withdraw, but there's going to. There's going to be another battle that happens down here in New Orleans. But now let me just mention what's important about 1814. 1814 is the year that Napoleon was finally defeated, okay? Which means that now there's no longer a war between Britain and France. And the only reason why the United States was in the war with Britain was over the war between Britain and France. And whether or not the United States could trade. You guys follow me here. And the British don't want to. The British want to resume trading with the Americans because they're making money off of it, right? And so the British. At. When Napoleon is defeated, the British decide to call off the war, essentially, right? And there will be a. They'll negotiate a treaty at a place called Ghent in Holland, right? And the treaty will return the situation between the United States and Britain to the way it was before. They call it the status quo ante the way it was before, meaning that the United States doesn't win anything, but they don't lose anything. You guys follow? I'm saying that's essentially the outcome. The outcome is that the United States doesn't win anything, but it doesn't lose anything. Okay? But now what's going to happen? That treaty is actually signed on Christmas Eve. In 1814. But it's going to be a battle here in 18, actually December. Actually it ends up happening in January of 1850. Right. It's called the Battle of New Orleans. You probably have heard of it, right. There's an american militia general from Tennessee named Andrew Jackson, and he's going to lead a kind of a ragtag army of, of militiamen and pirates and slaves and people like that against a well organized british army. And the Americans will win that battle. And the battle happens in January of 1815. So keep in mind then that the Battle of New Orleans happens after the war is already officially over because the treaty was signed on Christmas Eve of 1814. You guys follow me here. So essentially the United States really is no longer at war. They just don't know it yet. All right, you guys following here, but because of the great distances involved, Americans in the east are going to learn about the Battle of New Orleans before they learn about the Treaty of Kentucky. So from the point of view of the Americans, they hear Andrew Jackson's won this great battle in New Orleans and the next thing then is that we've got a treaty and we didn't lose. So Americans are going to say, well, we won. Edward Jackson won the war for us. Right. And the Americans then will claim victory to this day. Actually, if you, most people will, if you hear people talking about the War of 1812, they'll say the Americans won. The reality is that the Americans didn't lose. That's the best they can say. They can't say they actually won. They didn't gain anything. Right. The idea, the reason why so many people supported the war was that they were going to be able to get Canada, but they didn't get Canada. They didn't get anything. Right. And so there was a real fear on the part of the president that Americans would be against the treaty because they didn't gain anything. But because of Andrew Jackson's victory, Americans believed they had won. And what's going to follow is this era of super patriotism. It's called the era of good feeling. Right. And the ear of good feelings is what we're going to talk about after we come back from spring break."

","Let's look at the new deal. A lot of different acronyms, which we're not going to actually have to talk about all of them. You don't have to remember them. Right. But let's go back and start with historically chronologically. The man who was president when the stock market crashed was Herbert Hoover. Herbert Hoover was a Republican. And because he was a Republican, he believed in capitalism and he believed that, that the depression was just another downturn, that capitalism went through boom and bust cycles. And then when it was in a boom cycle, everybody's making money. When it's in bust cycles, you just kind of entrench, you know, and, and wait and it'll come back eventually. That's the idea. Right. And that historically, that's the way it looked. Right. It looked like that's what had happened. Did you have a question? Cooper? Yeah. Didn't everyone hate Hooper Hoover? Well, not everyone, but Hoover did take the blame for the Great Depression because they, they said he didn't do anything. Right. Which is not true. He did do some things, but he didn't think that there was a, that was necessary to, to do anything extraordinary because he thought that it was just a natural capitalist cycle. Does that make sense? And so the result was that one of the things that Roosevelt was able to do was to say, look, this guy hasn't done anything, okay? What the difference between Hoover and Roosevelt was that Roosevelt had been governor of New York and he had been trying different things to alleviate the economic problems in New York. And he promised the american people that if he was elected president, that he would do that on a national scale, that he was going to offer the american people a new deal. And this new deal would be essentially that the government has a role to play in the welfare of the people. Okay? Now, this was different from what people had thought before. What people thought before was that the government was there to do only the things that the people couldn't do that. Right. And the idea that the government was there to actually help people was, the idea was that the government wasn't supposed to help people. It was just supposed to do those things, that it was supposed to keep its hands off. Right. Laissez faire. That was the idea. Right. But here's Roosevelt. Roosevelt comes along and says, no, the government has a role to play, that the government should play a major role in and restoring the welfare of the people. Right. And people bought that. Why? Because they didn't have anything. And because Hoover wasn't trying to do anything. He did some things, but he really wasn't that interested in trying to fix the problem because he thought the problem would fix itself. And Roosevelt said, no, it's not going to fix itself. And the reality was that it wouldn't because capitalism, as I said, was dead. Right. Okay, so Roosevelt's elected with a promise of a new deal, which meant government intervention in the economy, right? But now let's take a look at the very first that Roosevelt does on his first day in office is to sign what's called the emergency Banking act. All right? And what the emergency Banking act did was it declared a bank holiday, meaning that all the banks in the country were forced to close and that no banks could reopen until they had met certain safety standards that would protect the money that was invested by the depositors. Okay, you guys are with me. And really what it did was it separated the banking system from the stock system, from the investment system, right? So they created a couple of different agencies. One, the FDIC, which ensures bank deposits, meaning that if you're the guy behind the guy that got the last of the money, you'd still be able to get your money, but in this case, it would come from the government. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? And then the other part was the securities Exchange Commission, which regulates trading, right. And it keeps banking out of the trading industry. Okay, you guys are all with me. Question comments? Okay, so this is to ensure that what had happened that caused the Great Depression wouldn't happen again. Okay? But now let's think about this for a minute. Why would Roosevelt be interested in, in making people have confidence in the bank? Why would he want people to have confidence in the bank? So the money in the bank and bringing the economy back. Okay. So if they put money in the bank, what's that going to do to the economy? How is that going to help the economy? Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead cooper oh, people could start creating capital again, right? And so because you could have capital, then you could have what? Jobs and labor laws? Capitalism, right. Because remember I said you can't have capitalism without capital. And that's what had happened. The industry had collapsed because there wasn't any capital, right. And so now if we restore the capital, then we can restore the capitalist system. Right? So having said all that, then what do you think is the major focus of the new deal? What was the real major focus of the new deal? To restore capitalism. To restore capitalism. Exactly. Now, why do I say that? Well, because, I mean, as I've already mentioned to you, I think I may have mentioned to you that the last speaker of the House, republican speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, had said that it was his job, it was his aspiration to destroy the New Deal. Why? Because it's socialist, right? And Americans don't like socialism. But now we have to go back and think about what was the purpose of the New Deal? Was it to establish a new economic system? Was it to establish socialism or was it to save capitalism? Go ahead Cooper I kind of see it as like almost like a safety net for capitalism. Like when all else fails, these things will sort of like maintain trust in the capitalist system in a way. Exactly. So, so what we see in this member, I told you on the last slide that the only country that was still capitalist at the end of the 1930s was the United States. All of the other countries had done something else more drastic, like falangism or nazism or militarism or socialism, right? But not the United States. The United States was still a capitalist economy. Right? So the, the argument that we need to get rid of the new deal because its purpose is to destroy capitalism is just wrong. If you like capitalism, you have to like the new deal. You know what I'm saying? I mean, I'm not saying you should like capitalism or not like it one or the other, but I'm saying that if you like it, you have to like the new deal. Okay. Well, let's look at some other things that happened. Okay? The first one is, this is important, too, and that is the national Industrial Recovery act. Basically what it does is it supports labor, right? Labor, it means unions, okay? And one of the things I have mentioned to you guys already before is that Americans have really not been very much in favor of unions. Government has never been in favor of unions. Right? And the reason why is because unionism is seen as communism or socialism. The idea, the idea that people coming together, collective bargaining, that's socialism. It's like the proletariat taking over the bourgeoisie. And so Americans have never really supported labor except during World War one for a very short period of time, and then during the Great Depression and also World War two. Okay? So the only time really that Americans have supported labor has been during these periods of time. But one thing that we can notice, the consequence of unionizing is that the unions actually created the middle class, right? It raised the workers out of the lower classes and into the middle class. So when we looked at this country as a middle class country in the 1960s and the 1970s, right. It was that because of unions, okay? Now, obviously, there's people who would argue with me on that one, but I think I have the numbers to back me up. But at any rate, the point here is that what we see happening with the decline in support for labor is the decline of the middle class, right? So in the last 20 years, the middle class has essentially disappeared. There's this huge income gap between a few people that own most of the money and then huge amounts of people that own almost nothing. Right. And the middle class, if it exists at all, is diminishing. You guys follow what I'm saying here? And I think that you can't help but associate that with the decline in union representation. Okay. Anyway, questions, comments about that? All right, so next, there was a bunch of different programs that were put together to stimulate spending, like civilian work, works Administration, a civilian conservation corps. That's this one here. Public Works Administration, rural electrification agency, all these different things. The idea was to spend money to get money back into the economy, right? So it's very much like what we see happening today. I don't know if you looked at your bank account yet today, but today or tomorrow or the next day, you probably will find a pretty substantial check in there. Right? And the reason why it's there is because they're trying to put money into the economy. Right? And the metaphor that they use for that is priming the pump. Okay? Now, you might not know this, you might not know how pumps actually work, but. But in the old days, back in my day, if you wanted water, you had to go outside to where the well was. And there was a pump coming up out of the well with a big handle. And you'd pump the handle, and then the water would come out. Right. But it didn't work right at first because it was dried out. So you would have to put water into the pump to seal it so that it would actually pull the water out of the well. You guys follow me here. All right? So the idea of priming the pump is you put a little bit of water into the top and it brings all the water out of the bottom out of the well. Okay? And same thing here. You put a little bit of money into the economy, and it'll start the economy flowing again so that there's more money coming out. You guys follow I'm saying here? That's what they mean by priming the pump. Okay? In this case, it would be you put money into the hands of people. People have money now. They want to buy something, but they can't buy anything if nothing's being made. So people start making things right. And because they start making things, they have to hire people to make them. Right. And gets the economy rolling again. You guys follow what I'm saying here? That makes sense. Now, let me just mention to you, sadly, that historically speaking, stimulus has never worked, that no country has ever been able to buy its way out of a depression. Okay? Not saying it won't work now, but up to now it hasn't really worked. Okay? Just leave it at that. All right. Then this idea of direct relief, federal Emergency Relief act, basically what that was, Congress passed the law and said, here's $500, come and get it. Right. Well, what's interesting about that, two things. One is that the federal government had never made direct payments to individuals. Right. The federal government, if it made any payments at all, made payments to its own agencies or to states, right. But not to the people, because the federal government was supposed to. Was not supposed to really have that relationship with the people. Right. You guys follow what I'm saying? All right, so here we have the Congress saying, here's money, come and get it. Right? Which a lot of people are screaming about. The federal government shouldn't be doing that. It's outside of its mandate, essentially. Right. The other part of it was that people didn't want it. Right. People wouldn't take it. And the reason why was because they didn't want to take money that they didn't work for. And so what they had to do was they had to create basically make work programs. So you have to go downtown and empty the trash or something like that. And then you get your $500. Right? But the idea here is that this is the beginning of what we would call the welfare state. Right. The welfare state, meaning that the federal government is now supporting individuals. Federal government is no longer just an umbrella organization for the states. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. Okay. Last thing. Social Security. Social Security. Idea behind Social Security was that people, if they got older, they got sick and they couldn't work anymore, there was nothing for them to rely on. If they didn't have family or something like that, then they were just out of luck and there wasn't any, what they call a safety net, okay? And so the idea then was to create a safety net. And the way that they did that was by taxing people who are working, right? So up until this time in american history, when you went through each year, each census year, which you remember happens every ten years, right. Every census year had seen an increase in population. Okay? So the expectation was that the population would continue to increase and that the people who were in the workforce would always outnumber the people who were retired. So that the people in the workforce would be able to pay into a fund that they could take out of that fund and pay to the people that were retired. You guys get what I'm saying? And that would always work because the population was always going to grow. The problem was, after World War Two, there was a huge increase in population that was very short lived where they created the baby boomer generation. Okay, Boomer. And then the population started to decline, and it's continued to decline since then. So the reality is now, I mean, I just retired this last year, and I'm basically in the middle of the baby boom generation. Right. Okay, Boomer. And, and, and what we see happening then is that there's more and more people retiring, less and less people paying into Social Security. You see what I'm saying? So, so the reality is that Social Security can't continue to pay out what it's paying out now without either raising taxes or lowering the benefit. You follow? I'm saying, well, neither one of those things is an attractive possibility for old people. And the last thing you want to do is, is get old people angry because old people vote. Right? And so basically then, Social Security has a built in problem that nobody wants to touch because it's political. It's a, it's a political loser. Okay. One other problem with Social Security is that even though it's essentially taking money from the people we're working now and giving to the people that are retired, that's not the way they sold it. The way they sold it was that you were paying money into an account that was your account that you would be able to draw on at the end of. At the end of your career, essentially. Right? So every year I used to get a letter saying, this is how much money you've paid into your account, and this is how much money you can get if you retire at whatever age. Right. The reality is that that money that's supposed to be in my account isn't there, okay? There is no account. All right? And that the money that's being paid to me today through my Social Security is coming from you guys who are working and paying Social Security. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay? So the problem here then is to say you can't go to people and say, okay, well, remember we told you you had this account full of money? Guess what? We were just kidding. You don't really have an account full of money. You have nothing. Right. You see what I'm saying? So it's a huge problem based on really a bad sell. And the result is that it's something that is going to be very difficult to solve. Also, I think another part of the issue is that people are just living longer in general because of healthcare and stuff. It's always improving technology. So like it's also an ongoing, I guess not alien issue, but an issue. No, it is an issue because the expectation. How dare you live longer. Yeah, exactly. The expectation. In 1933 or four, whenever they put this in before, I think when they put it into effect was that people, I mean, 65 was old. Nobody lived past 65. Right. And now we got people living to 80, 90. I have, I have friends who are in their seventy s. Eighty s. Right. And so people are living longer and collecting more money and there's people, less people paying into it. So that's, you're right. That is a problem."

","Let's see how this works in a real world example, okay? And the first thing we have to do is we have to think a little bit about mexican history. Okay? We've already discussed briefly the independence of Spanish America when we talked about the Monroe doctrine. What happens in Mexico is that there is a long civil war. It starts in 1810. And if many of you, if you know anything about Mexico, you know that Mexican Independence Day is September 16 and die cis. And it is the anniversary of el Grito, which was the cry of liberty that was announced by Hidalgo on September 16, 1810. So that's the day that they celebrate independence, but they didn't actually gain independence until 1821. Okay? So it's kind of like in the United States, we celebrate american independence on July 4, but America didn't actually gain independence until 1783. You guys follow what I'm saying? So, at any rate, the point here is that Mexico becomes an independent country in 1821. When it becomes independent, the first government that's installed is a constitutional monarchy. But that government doesn't last very long. Let me just say. Let me say it this way, that the controversy that plagued the United States in the first administration over what kind of a country is the United States. Is it an economic powerhouse, a conservative state, or is it a liberal state? Every other independent country attaining independence during this period of time experienced something similar. So in Mexico, instead of calling them federalists and democratic republicans, they call them centralists and federalists, okay? And the centralists were the more conservative ones. And the centralists believed that the Mexico, the independent Mexico should be ruled in the same way that it had been under the spanish monarchy. Because under the spanish monarchy, the people that were in control had made lots of money. Right? So centralism basically says everything has to be ruled from the center. During the monarchy, the center was the king. But now that they're a republic, the center is the government in Mexico City. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. But at the same time, the government that Mexico installed was a federal government, meaning a government like the United States that has two levels of government, a federal government and a state government. But in the mexican constitution, the state governments were much more powerful than the governments in the United States. Okay? And the result of that was that the federalists believe that most of the authority in the country should reside in the states rather than in the central government. So it's really. It's very similar to what happened in the United States. The problem is that in the United States, we saw that controversy between centralism and federalism or between federalists and democratic Republicans become the subject of american politics. And the differences between the two different ideals are worked out in the ballot box, and that's because of the election of 1800 and the peaceful transfer of power. But that doesn't happen in Mexico or anywhere else. Right. What happens instead is that when the original group is voted out of office, they refuse to leave office, and after every election, they have an uprising. Essentially it's called a pronunciamiento, right? And they fight it out. So the way that it works in Mexico is going to be that they have the election, and then whoever loses the election refuses to give up, and then they fight it out. And whoever wins the battle wins the government, essentially. Right. That makes sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? You guys are following me here. And the division between the centralists and the federalists is as bad or worse as the division between the democratic Republicans and the federalists in the United States. And essentially what it means is that they're willing to kill each other in order to gain control of the government. All right, you guys are all with me with this. Questions? Comments? So the first government that was actually enacted in, like I said, in Mexico was a federalist government. And during this time of the federalist government, there was one of the problems that Mexico had was the northern frontier, because the northern frontier, let me just show you a map here. The northern frontier consists of all of these territories, okay? And these territories are very sparsely populated by Mexicans, okay? Mexican. The Mexican, the hispanic lifestyle. Hispanic culture is an urban culture, and they don't want to live out in the middle of nowhere, a little house on a prairie, right? And so most of the population of Mexico was, was concentrated in the cities. And since there really weren't any cities in this vast northern territory, hardly anybody went there. And they couldn't even get people to go there. They couldn't even, they couldn't even lure people there or bribe them to go there. And the problem was that the border between the United States and Mexico was, was fluid. Nobody actually really knew where it was. And beyond that, that Americans and others, particularly Americans, I mean, the Russians and the British, also had their eyes on California. Right, and Texas. But the Americans are very aggressive about their ideas of, of taking this territory. So Mexico. So Mexico, when it becomes independent, is concerned about the integrity of their border. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? You guys are all following me here, right? Okay. So now, in the 1830s, 1820s, there was an economic downturn in the United States, and there was a group of people who decided that they wanted to emigrate to find better opportunity. And they were led by this guy Moses. Not Moses from the Bible, but Moses Austin. Right? Moses Austin went to Mexico City to negotiate, moving into Texas, bringing a group of people into Texas. And he received permission to bring these people into Texas. The idea, the agreement, was that he could bring in 20,000 settlers, but that those settlers had to become mexican citizens, and they had to swear allegiance to Mexico, they had to learn how to speak Spanish, and they had to become Catholics, all right? And so here these people are faced with the opportunity to get free land. And keep in mind that land is still considered to be wealth, right? These people are faced with the possibility of attaining free land if they learn how to speak Spanish. And so they say, hola, I'm Mexican, right? And so they all move in, and there's actually a concentration of Americans in Texas. All right? Now we want to say, okay, well, this was supposed to solve the problem of the mexican government by actually creating 20,000 mexican citizens in Texas. And legally, technically, that was true, but in reality, the people that moved into Texas never considered themselves Mexicans. They always considered themselves american, and they always believed that at some point, Texas would become part of the United States. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so now, this guy, Stephen Austin, was the guy who led all of the people in. Here's what happens when we're looking at this centralist federalist controversy. When. When the Americans moved into Texas, one of the understandings that they had was that they would be self governing because this was under the federalist government, okay? And so their authority would be local to them, just like many people in the United States believed. And as part of that, they counted on the ability to own slaves, because the economy of Texas was a plantation economy, like everywhere else in the south, okay? And so when they moved in there, there was this understanding that Texas would be. Would be allowed to. The settlers in Texas would be allowed to use slaves, right, to own slaves, and that they would be relatively self governing, okay? But in 1826, the mexican government outlawed slavery. So there was a bit of a kerfuffle in Texas because the settlers in Texas were all upset because they thought they were going to lose their slaves. But they made a deal with the mexican government that they could keep their slaves for now, even though at some point, they're going to have to get rid of them. But, okay. So that kind of solves that problem a little bit. But there's another problem, and that is that even though there are 20,000 american settlers that were allowed to come in because they're there, a number of other Americans are crossing the border illegally to get into Texas to squat on the land. Right. So if you cross the border from one country to another country without permission, what do you call that? Illegal immigration. Illegal immigration. So Mexico had a terrible illegal immigration problem from Americans. You guys are following me here. All right? And so what they did is they decided they were going to close the border, right? They didn't. They didn't build a wall, but they were going to close the border to keep the Americans out. Right? And in the middle of all this, there's this political turmoil between centralists and federalists that's happening. And in 1836, the centralists actually overturned the government and rewrote the constitution. Okay? And that constitution then placed the power in Mexico, in the central government, which meant that Texas now could no longer rule itself, that it had to, that it was ruled directly by the central government in Mexico. You guys follow me here? And that meant that they had to get rid of their slaves. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? Now, I should mention in terms of. I mean, you don't know a lot about mexican history, but I do, right. That when the centralists took over, Texas declares independence. But Texas isn't the only place. There were a number of different states in Mexico that declared independence because they were. Because they felt that their power had been curtailed with this idea of the. What sort of. I'm looking for centralist government taking power away from the states. Okay? But what happens in Texas is that the Americans in Texas declare independence, and then they vote they create a government, a constitutional government, and they apply for admission to the United States. Okay? Now I want to mention a couple things here about that. The first one is when Texas declared independence, they declared their territory to consist of everything north of the Rio Bravo. And I don't know if you guys will remember, but a couple of weeks ago, we talked about how the border of Texas was understood always to be at the Nueces, and everybody agreed on that. The United States agreed on that. Mexico agreed on that. France agreed on that. England agreed on that. Everybody agreed that this was the border of Texas. When Texas declared independence, they said the border was at the Rio Bravo. Why did they say that? Well, the reason why was because, if you guys will recall, when they were negotiating the Treaty of Adams Onis, which was negotiating the treaty between the United States and Mexico over the boundary that the United States had opened its arguments with the. With the Rio Bravo or the Rio Grande, and that was an open kind of bargaining chip. Right? And at the end, they settled for the boundary here at the Sabine. Okay, you guys are with me. So, from the point of view of. After the Treaty of Adams Onis, from the point of view of the United States, the border of Texas was at the Nueces. Actually, from the point of view of both the United States and Mexico, the border of Texas was at the Nueces, and the border of the United States was at the Sabine and the red. And that the real Bravo wasn't anything. Okay, you guys, follow me here. You guys need to pay attention, because this is going to be important in a minute. It's a little complicated, but it's important. Okay, so. So Texas declares that its border is at the Rio Bravo, and then that's when you're going to see the invasion of Texas from Mexico, led by Santa Ana. Santa Ana was President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, and he leads an army into Texas to try to force Texas back into compliance, I guess, or into union with Mexico City. And he's defeated. He wins Adelaide, the Alamo. You guys have all. You guys have all heard of the Alamo, and if you've ever been there, you'll see that it's like a shrine where Texans celebrate their freedom, and we'll just leave it at that for now. But at any rate, the Mexicans won the battle at the Alamo, but they lost the battle at another place just near Houston called San Jacinto. The mexican army was defeated. Santa Anna was captured, and he was forced to sign a document recognizing the independence of Texas. Okay, so Texas becomes independent, theoretically, in 1836, even though what happens after that is that Santa Ana is freed. And then he denies that. He actually. He said he signed the paper under duress, and they. And everybody in Mexico denies that Texas is independent. And every mexican government swears that they're going to eventually force Texas back into the union, but they can't do it right now because they're too busy fighting each other. Okay, so the political unrest in Mexico prevents any trying to force Texas back into union, but at the same time, everybody in Mexico believes that Texas is part of the mexican territory. You guys follow what I'm saying? And it's a big political issue. If anybody ever says in Mexico only just let Texas go, they're considered to be a traitor. And any government that considers giving up Texas can't last."

","Let's talk about Spain. Now, Spain is a little bit different from the rest of Europe that we've been talking about. And that's because Spain, for much of the Middle Ages was dominated by the Muslims. Actually, there was a constant warfare that was happening between Muslims and Christians in Spain in the year. I can't remember the year. I think it was four something. I don't know why I can't remember it. But anyway, the spanish peninsula was invaded by Moors under the rule of the empire. And they crossed over into Spain at a place called Hibaltarique, which is now called Gibraltar. And they were able to overrun the spanish peninsula, really, all the way up into France. And then they weren't actually french at the time. They were Franks. But the Franks under Charles Martel are going to be able to repel the Aztecs, and they are forced across. There's a mountain range here called the Pyrenees. And this mountain range is what separates Spain from the rest of Europe. So Spain was under the influence of the Moors, or the Arabs, the Muslims, throughout the period up until 1492. Okay, so the only part of Spain that wasn't conquered by the Moors was. Okay. The only part of Spain that wasn't conquered by the Moors was this area here, Asturias. Okay, now, I can remember the year. The year was 711. And the reason why we can remember that is because that's where you get your beer and cigarettes, 711. Right. And that's how I remembered it. But anyway, the year 711, the Moors come and they conquer everything except for this territory. And then what happens is that there's this constant warfare for 700 years where you can see the Moors being pushed back further and further by the Christians. Okay? So this is really a religious war, a religious war between the Christians and the Muslims. And what that does is it creates a society that is ultra Catholic. They are the most catholic country because they are united by their religion. And they're also warlike people, a people with a military tradition. Okay? And then in the year 1492, the last of the moorish kingdoms, Granada, was conquered, okay? And what ends up happening then is that the spanish peninsula will be united under two christian monarchs called the catholic kings. The two christian monarchs are Ferdinand and Isabella. We call them the kings, but it's actually a king and a queen. Right? And the kingdoms were united by the monarchy. And so what we have then emerging in 1492 is a powerful, unified christian nation with a militaristic tradition and religious zeal. Now that the conquest of, or the reconquest they call it la re conquista. I think I've written it down here somewhere. Let me just write it here for you. Okay Laurecon which means the reconquest, right. Once that's completed, then they're going to be looking for ways to expand. All right, questions, comments about this? All right, so now the Spanish are able to complete Lara conquista and because as I mentioned to you before, the conflict was a religious conflict that meant that once they had reunited the peninsula, they wanted to reunite it in terms of its religion as well. And so one of the things that happens in the year 1492 is that the Jews are expelled. They've gotten rid of the Muslims. Now they're going to get rid of the Jews so that they can be purely catholic in Spain. And that will be true really in the rest of the spanish empire as well once there is one, which there isn't yet. Okay. And then finally they're going to be looking for ways to expand."

","Let's talk about some of these reforms that go into place during this era. And keep in mind that these are all brought about by election, by voting, right? Okay, so first one, direct democracy. Where rather than having everything done by the governor and the legislature or by the president and the Congress, us, especially in the states, we see the implementation of these three reforms, proposition, the referendum and the recall. And we should be familiar with all of those here in California because everybody knows that whenever there's an election, there's signs all over the place saying yes on 13 and no on seven and that sort of thing. Right. And what are we voting on? We're voting on things that we think should be enacted into law. And if there's a majority that's in favor of a certain proposition, then it gets enacted into law. Right. So that's us ruling ourselves. That's direct democracy. Okay? You follow what I'm saying? So that's the proposition. The referendum is when the legislature does something that we think is wrong, we can actually vote to have that law repealed. Right? So let's say that we have a proposition, proposition iC. And that proposition says everybody gets ICE cream on Tuesdays, right. And we like that idea. So we go ahead and vote for everybody getting ICE cream on Tuesdays, right. And it goes into law. But the legislature doesn't like that because they're invested in the chocolate industry. So they don't want people eating ICE cream, they want them eating candy. So they pass a law saying nobody gets ICE cream. Right. In the one sense, we enacted a law that we wanted, and then we see the legislature acting against our interests so we can overthrow that law. We could do away with that law, right, by voting. If the majority of the people say that law shouldn't go into an effect, then it doesn't. Right. You get what I'm saying? Okay, so that's the referendum. And then the recall is when you don't like what the politician's doing, you can vote them out of office. All right, so all of those things together, you can see that happening right now with Newsome. A lot of people are trying to recall Newsom. Right. And then it was Gray Davis actually was recalled, and that's when the governator became governor. Right. Okay. So all three of these together, then, are the implementation of what we would call direct democracy. But let me give you a look for a caveat to all this. And that is, in order to get a proposition on the ballot, you have to get so many signatures. And in order to get those signatures, you're going to have to pay people to go stand in front of the grocery store and collect them. Right? You guys have all seen them out there. Right? Same with the referendum and the recall. Somebody has to go and collect those signatures, and that's going to cost money. Right. And so what we see happening then is that the special interests write the proposition and they hire the people to collect the signatures so that they can get their proposition on the ballot. Right. But because they have the money, they're still able to essentially bypass this idea of direct democracy in a way. So what we see is that the special interests still have influence on government. It's just they get their influence in a different way. Instead of just paying money to the legislature, they pay it to people who collect signatures. Right. But they still get their way. You guys get what I'm saying? And there is more democracy built into it than before, but there is still that danger or the actual reality of special interests kind of hijacking that whole thing. All right, questions? Comments about any of that? Do all propositions require signatures or can it just be big money? No, you have to have a certain number of the registered voters who sign in favor of the proposition in order to be able to get it on the ballot. I think it's like 5% or 10%, something like that. Right. And then once it's on the ballot, then generally the people would vote for it in the next election. Unless, like, for example, there was a proposition, I think it was the proposition to divide California into three different states. Right. And they did collect signatures for that, but then it was rejected by the courts, so it never went on the ballot. Any other questions? Comments? Okay. All right, so that's direct democracy. Also direct election of Us senators. You guys will remember that we talked on Monday about how the Senate had become a millionaires club because they were appointed by the states and the states so the people that were the senators could actually buy their way into office, and then they would work for whoever gave them the money rather than the people that elected them. And so that will be actually enacted in 1913, where 17th amendment of the Constitution says that all senators are elected. And that's what we see happening everywhere today, including in California. We saw that Kamala Harris was elected senator when Barbara Boxer retired. But interestingly, when she left office, then how did we choose who took her place? The governor chose. Exactly. And that's how it was done before the 17th amendment. You get what I'm saying? That same thing happened, for example, in Illinois when Barack Obama was elected president. He was senator from Illinois. So he left his seat in the Senate to become president, which left that seat open. And then the Governor Blagojevich basically sold that seat. He put it up for sale and then he ended up going to jail for that. Right. He was pardoned by Trump, but he went to jail for selling a Senate seat, essentially. Right. You get what I'm saying? And that shows us then how the corruption could be easily built into the senators be appointed by the states. All right. Questions? Comments? Labor protections. Remember that before we talked about the workers, the proletariat, who we say is, for example, on the movie that we watched, Los Mineros, right. And they were forced to work long hours for barely enough to live on. And also there was no protection for any class of labor actually. Right. So we had kids as little as five and six years old working in factories and working in mines, things like that. Right. So one of the kind of class of things that's going to come out of the progressive era is going to be the 40 hours work week and child labor laws and things like that. The thing that we need to understand is that, like, for example, when we looked at that movie, Los Mineros, what that movie told us was that it was the unions that actually caused these changes to come about. But the reality was that the unions didn't become powerful until after World War II. And these laws were put in place before, well before World War II, even before World War I. Right. And so then who was it that actually did this? It wasn't the labor movement because the labor movement was essentially dead in the United States at the time. There were unions, but they were not popular and there weren't very many people in them. Right. So these labor protections are put in place by progressives who we already said were the middle class. Right. So why would the middle class be interested in putting in protections for the workers? The child labor laws make sense because you shouldn't be working children like that anyways. Why? Because morally, I don't know. Their children, they're developing, they have to do school. That would be dangerous, I guess. Yeah, I was going to developmental. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Right. But what if you don't care about that? What if you care about, all you care about is making money. It's kind of working for China. I'm sorry. It's kind of working for China. Well, I mean, that's the thing. What we see happening there is what happened everywhere in the industrial revolution. Right. The idea that, yeah, it's morally wrong, but what happens if you're the parents of a kid that gets killed in a mine. How are you going to respond to that? Are you going to be happy? No, you're not going to be happy. What are you more likely to do? Are you going to be a good, happy worker after that? Are you going to be an upstanding member of society after that? Exactly. I'll get my two weeks getting out of there. Well, you couldn't though, because if you got out of there, you would get nothing. There was no place to go. Right. That's the thing. So what then that does is it creates social conflict, social upheaval. Right. And if there's enough social upheaval, what happens, what happens to the people that are property owners? They lose your stuff. They lose their stuff. Exactly. When we look at the progressive interest in labor reforms, the progressives weren't laborers, but they were interested in labor reforms. And there was a moral component to it that many of them saw that the suffering of the people was wrong and needed to be addressed. But there was also this economic component as well, because people who own things don't want social upheaval. They want calm. Right. And you're not going to get calm by creating a class of people that hates you. Right. You follow what I'm saying? There was basically both of those things, but it was really put in place by progressives rather than the unions. Unions come later, and unions are really important, but at this point in time they were pretty ineffective. Okay, questions, comments about this. Okay, so corporate regulation, antitrust, antimonopoly and railroad regulation is to address, well, really anti consumer policies are put in place by companies. And so if we say, okay, we're going to regulate the companies, who is that going to hurt? Companies. Let's say it the other way around. If we don't regulate the companies, who does that hurt? The workers. The workers, and not just the workers but consumers in general. Right. Because the prices are fixed, there's no competition. Right. Okay. But now if we are able to regulate the corporations, who benefits? Consumers? Consumers. If you think about it, the corporations also benefit because the workers essentially will be more happy. Right. And because of that, the regulation actually helps them. It doesn't help them in terms of their immediate bottom line, but it does help them in the long term by allowing them to stay in business. Right. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? So generally speaking, the corporations will never support any of this stuff, but if you look at it in a pragmatic way, you can see that it actually does help them. All right, questions? Comments? Sorry. Comment? That reminds me of, I don't know if the story is true or not, but Ford giving his workers Saturdays off so that way they'd go buy his cars. Yeah, well, that was a big thing. Ford was one of the first companies to introduce things like company health insurance and limits on the amount of work you could do and things like that. And the reason why was because he realized that if he kept his workers happy, they would work better and make better products for him and he'd make more money. Right. You see what I'm saying? And he wasn't the only one that did that. He was the first one. But then afterwards, people started to see, the problem was that I think there was an era, really right around the time of the progressive era, when american corporations started to see that they had a responsibility to the common good, right? But that's kind of an anomaly in general. Corporations are not going to be interested in the common good. Corporations are going to be interested in the bottom line. Right? And that's more like the way we see it today. You don't see companies acting in ways that are helpful to people. You see them acting in ways that will acquire as much wealth as possible for their shareholders. You follow what I'm saying? I think there's still some good companies out there that kind of, once you get inside them, they take care of their employees a lot better than other companies do. I do agree with that. But the only way that they would be socially responsible would be if it was to their benefit, and if it was to their benefit to not be socially responsible, then they would do that. If they had to choose between being socially responsible and not making money and being socially responsible and making money, a lot of them would choose the former or whatever. You know what I'm saying? Right. Okay. Not everyone. But that's the problem. The problem is that without government regulation, they might or they might not. It's up to them. With government regulation, then they're required to act in the public interest. You follow what I'm saying here? Anyway, that's really the argument for and against regulation. Okay? So then the next thing, social experimentation and control. Prohibition was one. Here's the idea behind prohibition, right? That drinking turned out to be a big problem among the working classes. And the reason why was because you had some guy who was a non skilled worker who was, like, working down at the docks, and he would get paid either at the end of the day or at the end of the week, whatever, right? And he would get paid in cash and he would take that money. And on the way home, he'd stop off at the bar and he'd start drinking and he'd spend all the money. And then he'd show up at home sometime around midnight, drunk, and the wife would be waiting for him there, the roller, to start beating on him. And then he'd beat her up. Right. And then the next thing you know, there's all this domestic turmoil. And then on top of that, because he's not bringing home the money, they get thrown out into the streets. Right. And that creates even more social turmoil. Right. So how do you respond to that? Well, the way the progressives decided to respond to it was, let's just make drinking illegal. Right. If you make it illegal, nobody will drink. Does that make sense? Yeah, on paper, yes. But, you know, people are going to try and sneak it in no matter what. Right. And that's exactly what happened. I'm sorry. That's why they made moonshine and they started having, what was it? I can't remember what they're called, but they had like these little hidden secret bars and clubs that. Speakeasies. Speakeasies. Where it's only word of mouth. Yeah, exactly. So here's the thing. The idea, the strategy was we're going to get rid of drinking so that we can make people happier and healthier. Right. But in reality, what ended up happening was that they fed into, what they did was they made all the drinkers criminals, and then they created this criminal organization that supplied alcohol to people, which ends up being organized crime. Right. So organized crime really is created in a way by this misguided attempt to make society better. You follow what I'm saying? All right, so that was kind of a backfire. Same thing with anti prostitution laws. Now, there isn't any federal law against prostitution, but there are almost every state has laws against it, except, I'm pretty sure, Nevada. Nevada, right. Okay. So. So the idea about prostitution was that these young women would have to sell themselves into prostitution in order to be able to support themselves. And it was demeaning to their womanhood, and it was also demeaning to their humanity and it was harmful to them. Right. And so we're going to make it illegal. And if we make it illegal, that means nobody will do it anymore, right? No, because they were doing it to survive. So they have a choice, legal or not. In fact, it makes the problem worse because before these anti prostitution laws, prostitutes lived in houses. There were houses of prostitution. Now they can't do that. So they're standing out on the streets you follow what I'm saying? So they're in more danger now than they were before. I'm not saying that we should support prostitutes. I'm just saying that this effort to regulate prostitution turns out to be to have unintended negative consequences. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? Okay. And then finally, expansion of the franchise. Now, it was part of the progressive platform for women's suffrage. Not suffering, but suffrage. But it was also encouraged by America's entry into World War I. And the reason why was because the United States entered the war, and a lot of men were sent to war. And those men who went to war were patriots, but they weren't able to vote because they were overseas. And in those days, there wasn't absentee ballots and mail in ballots and that sort of thing. Right. So what that meant was that the only people who could actually vote were the men who didn't go to war, and they were a bunch of cowards and woosies. Right. You follow what I'm saying? But women, there were patriotic women who couldn't vote. But if we gave them the vote, then they would be a counterbalance, I guess you could say, to the cowards and whisties. Right? And so that was one of the things that caused the 19th amendment actually to be enacted, because the way an amendment is enacted is it's passed by the Congress, and then it has to go to the states, and two thirds of the states have to ratify it in order for it to become a law. And that was not likely to happen until World War I happened. And this situation of the voting men being gone, voting population being gone, there are actually some states that have still not ratified the 19th amendment. Mostly states in the South. Alabama. Yeah, exactly. But because it's a federal law, they have to allow women's voting anyway. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? Let's think about this. Now. Who does allowing women to vote, who does that help? Women and the populace in general? Literally everyone. Exactly. Everyone benefits from more people being able to vote. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? Okay. All right. We'll just leave it at that. Okay. To be honest with you, ontologically, I cannot imagine how people could support the idea of excluding women from society. But that's because of my ontological outlook today, not because of historically. I probably would have thought differently if I lived at the time I."

","Let's talk about the war itself. And the first thing we want to really try to understand is why the war lasted so long if the north had such a great advantage. And it has to do with military leadership. As I mentioned to you before, Lincoln could not find generals who would win battles for him. Right? So one way that I've heard it described, and I think it's a good way to think about it, is to think about the military leadership of the north and south in terms of high school football. Okay? So in high school football, you have an a team and a b team or the varsity team and the JV team, something like that. You guys are with me. Right? You understand what I'm saying? Okay. And so the a team is a good team that fights the other a teams. Right. Or plays. I'm sorry. And the B team is the not so good team, but they play the other b teams, and they're all kind of on the same level. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? But in the civil war, the Union and the Confederacy both had an a team and a b team. Right? And the Union a team was Grant and Sherman. Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. Okay. And the Confederate a team was Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jackson. Okay. The Union B team was a bunch of different generals. We'll talk a bit about each one of these in a few minutes. Right. McClellan, Burnside, hooker, and Meade. Right. And the Confederate B team was another set of lesser generals. Albert Sidney, Johnson, John Bell, Hood, and there's a number of others. Right. But what you'll notice is that the Civil War is fought in two theaters. Let me just show you here. And I'm not talking about movie theaters. Right. But let's say. Let's take a look at this one right here. Right there. This is the western theater here. Right. And this is the eastern theater here. Right? So you can see that most of the battles that are fought in the eastern theater are fought in Virginia, and most of the battles that are fought in the western theater are fought in Tennessee and Georgia. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, now what we saw happen at the beginning of the war was that the Union A team was in the west, and the Confederate B team was in the west. And the Confederate a team was in the east. And the Union B team was in the east. All right? So we have a mismatch in leadership. Okay? In the west, the north has the advantage, the Union has the advantage, and in the east, the Confederacy has the advantage. Right. You guys get what I'm saying here? But now, where do most of the people in the United States live in 1861? In the north. In the east, or in the west? In the east. In the east. Exactly. All right. So. So that means that people are going to know a lot about what's going on in the east and they're not going to know as much about what's going on in the west. You follow what I'm saying here? And so what happens is, because the Confederacy is winning a number of battles in the east, people in both the north and the south will believe that the south is winning the war. All right? And even though the Union is winning enormous battles in the west, people don't realize that. Right? So up until 1863, with the battle of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, most people believed that the south was winning the war and couldn't be beaten. Okay? And that's one of the reasons why the war kept dragging on is because people believe that they were fighting a defensive war rather than an offensive war in the north, I should say."

","Let's think about the issues and let's think about the parties and think about who's in favor of what. Okay, I'm going to go up instead of down. And the reason why. You'll see why in a minute. Right. But, so the tariff. What's the purpose of the tariff again? Protective. Protective tariffs. Who benefits from it? The industry. Like the industrial. Industrial interest. Right. Okay. So. So who's going to be in favor of higher tariffs? Republicans or Democrats? Republicans. Republicans, exactly. Democrats are going to be against it because they're farmers. Right. Or they represent the farmers. Okay. Money. The money issue. The hard money, the gold standard. Who does the gold standard actually help? Hard money. It would be like the banks or whoever issued the money, they would favor them the most. Right. The hard money represents commercial interests and industrial interests. Right. And which party would be in favor, then, of hard money? The gold standard? The Republican. Republican Party. Exactly. Okay. And then Democrats would be against it. Now, what about the patronage issue? Who does that actually help, Democrats or Republicans? What do you mean? Both? Yeah, it's both. Right. See, that's the thing. The patronage. This is why I saved it for last. Because the patronage actually helps both parties. Right. Because both parties can make deals for political favors. Right. So what's going to happen is that patronage or civil service reform will not be an issue either of the Republican or the democratic parties. It will be a progressive issue. The progressives are going to be the ones who are going to fight for civil service reform. And then eventually what that will do is it will take power out of the hands of the old bosses, whether they're at top or closer to the bottom. So it's actually not a republican Democrat issue. It's actually an issue of progressivism or traditionalism, I guess you could say. All right, I played the song about the wizard of Oz at the beginning of the course, at the beginning of the class. Here's the reason why. It actually is a good song. I kind of like it. Right. But the wizard of Oz has been considered kind of a metaphor for this era in american politics that we're talking about. Right. So. So it's the. Again, the gilded age is an age of rapid economic growth, a shift from agriculture to industry, and massive income inequality, which leads to a lot of social unrest. And so the story of the wizard of Oz, the characters in the wizard of Oz is going to encapsulate those issues in american politics. Now, whether or not the author actually intended that is, we don't really know that, but what we do know is that we can make a good connection between the wizard of Oz and the Gilded Age or the progressive era. Right? So if we look in at the characters, the scarecrow is going to represent the farmers. The Tin man is going to represent industrial workers. The cowardly lion is William Jennings Bryan. I'm sure you guys have read about him in your textbook. And he's also going to be. We're going to see him again in the class in a couple of weeks. Right? Dorothy is going to represent the populist party. Talk more about why in just a second. And then the wicked witches are going to be industrialist. The wicked witch of the east is eastern industrialist, and the Wicked Witch of the west is railroads. Then the emerald city is Washington, DC, for obvious reasons. Right, because it's green. And the wizard will be President McKinley. All right. Okay. So then the big question that we're left with is, well, who does Toto represent? I want to leave this part behind and we'll talk more about this. But continuing our story about the period of time that we're living in, this movement towards industrialization is going to have a catastrophic effect on farming in America. Okay? And here's the reason why. Because farming is going to become more industrialized, meaning that corporations are going to be able to grow food that makes it possible for the prices to fall. Okay? And so what will happen to the individual farmer will be that he goes at the beginning of the season and borrows money, and he grows these crops, and at the end of the season, he tries to sell his crops to the railroad to take to market, and he can't get as much money as he actually borrowed because the prices have fallen. So he goes into debt, and the next year he borrows more money and he actually buys more seed and he produces more crops with the idea that, well, if I didn't make any money last year, I'm going to need to make this much stuff to make it money. So he'll take his crops to market, but because there's more of them, the prices are going to be falling and he'll go deeper in debt. Right? So every year he grows more and more food, and every year he goes deeper and deeper in debt until he finally will end up in bankruptcy. Right? The problem of the farmer really is driven by industrialization. And the response of the farmer is really going to be to try to stop industrialization, but that's not going to happen. The United States is an industrial country, and so family farming in the United States essentially will disappear. Okay? Now, that's not to say that there aren't any family farmers, but that individual farmers have been replaced by industrial farming. I mean, go out to the Imperial Valley and look what's going on out there. It's all big business. It's not single family farmers. It's all big business. Right? Okay. So essentially, even agriculture has become industrialized in the United States, and the family farmer will really disappear. Okay, but he's right, in a way to think that the problem is in the industrial revolution. But that's not where he focuses his efforts. Where he focuses his efforts is going to be on the railroad, because he's going to see that every year he's going to make more and more stuff, and every year the railroad is going to change and charge more and more. Right. And he's going to think that the railroad is basically screwing him and that if he could regulate the railroad, then they would be able to make money. All right? The problem with that is that a railroad is an interstate entity. Right? Railroad doesn't just go from someplace in California to someplace in California. It goes from California to Chicago. Right. So what would happen if we were able to get the state government in California to regulate the railroad, which they were able to do? Actually, Illinois was the first. Right. But what that would mean would be that state law would say that railroads can only charge so much to move goods in California. But what about when they got to Nevada? Right. Well, that would be under Nevada law. You follow me here? All right? And they can't control that. So the railroads could say, okay, well, we're going to charge you a dime to get it from Sacramento to the border, and then $1,000 to get it into Nevada. You see what I'm saying? So regulating at the state level isn't going to help them. And what they end up doing then is they form a national party. And the national party, essentially, in the beginning, is an anti industrial party, but it will become eventually a reform party. Okay? And the Reform party is going to be called the Progressive Party. It starts off as the populist party, and it is essentially the party of the farmers. Right. And these are going to be their platform, their issues. All right? And I'm going to go out of order again. Right. The first thing I want to talk about is the silver gold ratio. And this is going to be an answer to the money problem. Right? Okay. So what was the problem with money again? What was the two types of money? It was gold and greenbacks. Right? Right. The gold standard and greenbacks. Right. What was the problem? If we were actually on the greenbacks, and some people wanted to go to the gold standard. Why did they want to go to the gold standard? To make profit. Right. Because that puts them in competition with the British. Right. But what we saw happening was that if you went from a situation where the money was essentially floating, the amount of currency on the market was essentially floating to a situation where the money was actually tied to specie, which is gold. What's going to happen to the amount of money in the economy? The amount of currency that's actually in the economy is what goes down. It's smaller. Right. Yeah. Okay. One of the ideas that people will have is, well, what if we had more species, right. They can't buy more gold because there really isn't any more gold. Right. Most of the gold is already owned. So what they do is they suggest that we should buy silver at the rate of 16oz of silver is going to be equal to 1oz of gold. This is going to be called bimetalism. Right. And the idea would be then, if we put silver into the treasury along with the gold, there can be more what? More currency. More currency. Right. Which theoretically will solve the problem of, or at least one of the problems of going back on the gold standard. You follow what I'm saying? And this eventually will happen, that they will buy. The United States will buy up a lot of silver. Right. But I wanted to go. This one first was because we were just talking about the wizard of Oz, right? And you guys know that in the wizard of Oz, Dorothy had a special pair of shoes. What were they made of? Slippers. Rubies. I'm sorry. Rubies. Right. Ruby slippers. Exactly. All right. But in the book, the slippers were silver. Right. So let's think about this for a second. You have silver slippers and you have. What kind of a road was she on? Yellow. Yellow bricks. What do you think a yellow brick is? Gold. Right. So you see bimetalism there. Okay, he's got it. Anyway, so that's going to be one of the policies. The next one will be popular election of Us senators. In the original constitution, senators were actually appointed by the states, not elected by the people. Actually, the states were left up to choose however they wanted. Right. But the result was that the Senate was full of people with money and influence. The Senate was called a millionaires club. By the time we get to the end of the 19th century, and the progressives, the populace and then the progressives are going to say, well, we need to get those guys out of there. Because they're just protecting their own interests, right? They're not protecting the interests of the people. So then they're going to propose that the senators should be elected by the people rather than appointed by the states. All right? And then I'm going to go out of order again here. I'm going to talk about public ownership of railroads. Okay, so now, the idea of public ownership of railroads is that the government would essentially buy the railroads from the railroad companies and operate them themselves. Right. Meaning that because the government is made up of the will of the. Right, that would mean that the people own the railroads. And so rather than have the railroads owned by private corporations, they'll be owned by everybody. All right. Now, there's a huge problem with that in the United States. What do you think that is? Basically what they're saying is we're not going to allow private ownership. Instead, the government's going to own everything. Or that means that everybody owns everything in common. What does that mean? It's socialism. Socialism, communism. The idea that private property is taken away. Okay, so socialism and communism are always going to be rejected by Americans. Americans don't like communism or socialism because the idea behind communism and socialism is that everybody shares everything in common. And that looks like a good idea. That's one of the reasons why communism actually came about in the 1840s and why it was so popular in many places in the world was because it left lots of people without anything. Right. And if the only time that actually sharing everything seems like a good idea is when you don't have anything. So, for example, if you have a car and I don't have a car, I think it would be great if you lent me your car. But if I have a car and you don't have a car, I think you should get your own car. You follow how that works? You would think then, because there are so many poor people in America because of the industrial revolution, that they would be in favor of socialism, but they're not. And the reason why is because Americans always believe that they could be rich, right? There was a canadian scholar who explained that Americans socialism never became popular in America because America doesn't have any poor people. It only has temporarily displaced millionaires. And what that means is I might be poor now, but I might be rich later, and I don't want to give up my chance of owning things later. So I'm not going to be in favor of socialism. So essentially, the reason why Americans don't like socialism is because they like stuff. Everybody has stuff. Everybody wants more stuff. And they don't want to share it. So anyway, that's going to be the argument against public ownership of railroads, and that will never happen in the United States. The other one is similar to that graduated income tax. What that means is that the people who make more money pay a higher rate of taxes than the people who make less money. And some people don't pay any money. Right. Some people don't pay any tax because they don't make enough money to pay taxes. Right. So let's say now that I'm an adjunct professor and I don't make enough money to pay taxes, but then you compare me to somebody like Bezos, right, who makes tens of thousands of dollars an hour, and the idea behind a graduated income tax is because Jeff Bezos has so much more money, he should pay more, and because I don't have any money, I should pay less. Does that seem like a good idea? That's how they were able to balance out at the time. Right. That's what they did to balance it out. Like they made the richer pay more in taxes and the poor pay less in taxes. Well, that's the way it is now. We do have a graduated income tax, but many people are against it. Why would people be against it? Because it takes away from. Go ahead. It could discourage people from wanting to work harder in the future because that's true. But most people, I mean, even people who I know who are staunch capitalists, will say it's better to make money and pay taxes than. Right. But that's not really the issue here. The issue is we have to think about what are the taxes used for? In theory, public works. Public works, right. So taxes. The government raises taxes with our consent in order to provide services that are good for the people. That's the. Okay, so now what that means then, is that Jeff Bezos is paying $1,000 in taxes. I'm just making these numbers up. Right. And I'm not paying any. Right. But I get the same benefit as Jeff Bezos. Right. And so that means that Jeff Bezos. I'm actually benefiting from Jeff Bezos money. You see what I'm saying? And so Jeff Bezos is going to say, well, why should I pay for services for Dr. Cox? Let him pay for his own services. You follow what I'm saying here? So again, it's a matter of income distribution. It's a matter of. Or redistribution is better to say it. Okay. That we take money from those who have and give it to those who don't have. Right. But doesn't that sound like communism? From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. Right? And do Americans like communism? And why not? Because we think we're going to be rich because we like stuff. Right? We like stuff. I have stuff. I want stuff and I don't want to share it with anybody else. Now let me just mention to you, as I already said, that we have a graduated income tax in the United States. And let's think about the issue of socialism again. We'll bring this up again more later in the course, right? But if we think about the issue of socialism, Americans tend to think of free market, les faire versus socialism share everything, right? And there's a hard line between them. But in reality, there really is no such thing as a free market or Les fair. The government always has its hands on the economy, right? And the way that they do that and one way that they do that is by raising taxes, right? We all pay taxes. I mean, even if you don't pay income tax, you pay tax at the 711. So we all pay taxes. And so what we see then is that there is a kind of an element of socialism built into the system that claims to be capitalist, right? For example, let's say that we all pay taxes, but I pay much less taxes than so and so does. And yet the taxes are used to build a road and I get to use the road just like the other guy. Right? So I'm getting benefit for something that I didn't pay for, essentially, and that's income redistribution. Or we could talk about the military. The military doesn't just defend the people that pay the most taxes sends everybody. Right? And the fire department and all these different things, right? So there is an element then that could be labeled socialism and that a lot of people will label socialism. You listen to a hardline economic republican, they would say, well, we don't want to have the government do anything. Let's privatize everything and not have the government do anything, right? But most of those people are well outside the mainstream because everybody wants the services, everybody wants the roads, everybody wants to be safe from invasion and things like that, right? So we allow that even in a capitalist system. So even though we live in a capitalist system, there is an element of socialism. And the argument never really is should we have socialism or not? Or should we have government control of the economy or not? The question is how much control should there be, right? Should the government have very little control like the Republicans would want, or should the government have much more control like many of the Democrats would want. And that's what we argue about. That's the kind of the center of the focus of american politics. It's not over whether or not the United States government should be involved, but how much should it be involved? So when people will point to, well, like I said, the idea of, let's say, for example, welfare, people will look at welfare and say, okay, well, this person is not working and I'm paying for them to have food and shelter, right? So that's taking money from me to support them. That's not fair. Okay? But then at the same time, we see the government taking less money from corporations and supporting itself with money from who don't make as much, right? Like, for example, certain industries don't pay any tax at all, but they still get the benefit of american law. So isn't that socialism, too? So there's this idea of everything that I don't like is socialist is really just smoke. It's not real. Okay. It's not the reality of american politics."

","Let's think about this for a second. Capitalism leads to a wider distribution of wealth. Before, the only people that could be wealthy were the people who own the land. But now you don't need any land in order to create lots of wealth. So that means that more people can be wealthy, right? But now if more people can be wealthy, what does the golden rule tell us about? About political power? First off, what is the golden rule? Person that controls the wealth has the power. Right? Whoever has the gold makes the rules. Right? So that's not the one that you maybe learned in church, but this is the one that actually rules the world. Okay? The golden rule. Whoever adds the gold makes the rules. Right? And because more people own the gold, more people are involved in making the rules. Right? So just think about in your own experience with us history. Who were the american revolutionaries? American revolutionaries were not nobles. They were property owners. Adams, Washington, Jefferson. Right? They actually had. Okay? And because of that, they essentially set up a system where they rule. Okay? If you think about. I mean, you think about when the constitution was first in effect, most people were left out. Most people couldn't participate, right? It was only the wealthy. And we always say property owning white males. And we say that as if property owning white males is a bad thing to be. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't know. But the main thing here is that it was only because property owning white males were the only ones. Wait a minute. Property owning white males were the only ones who could hold wealth? Essentially. Right? And because of that, they end up being in control of everything. Okay. Questions? Comments about that. Okay, so then one of the things that happens. Okay, let's think about this. Remember we talked about the other day, Leslie, fair capitalism, right? We talked about how Adam Smith said that because the amount of wealth is unlimited, people should be allowed to use their own enlightened or should be able to pursue their own enlightened self interest, which means that people should be allowed to work to make as much money as they want and that the government should keep its hands off. That's what leslie faire means. Les Faire means the government keeps its hands off of the economy and lets the economy run itself. The invisible hand, essentially, is what runs the economy. But the idea behind that is that everybody that can get wealthy will get wealthy. And those people who don't want to get wealthy or are not willing to put in the effort will not get wealthy. That's the way it's supposed to work. Okay? And in reality, what's supposed to happen with capitalism, the way that Adam Smith imagined it was that capitalism would not produce a two class system with a wide gap, right? Like we see the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. And the reason why is because as soon as somebody started making lots of money, somebody else would come up with something a little bit better, and that would take away some of the first person's clout, I guess you could say, in the marketplace. And so because of competition, there would never emerge this class wage inequality, right? Income inequality. Okay. What really happens, though, is that the wealthy people, rather than allowing the government to keep its hands off, essentially come to control the government, and they use the government to protect their own interests. You guys follow what I'm saying here? The government is supposed to be completely hands off the economy. And if you ask any capitalist today, they'll say, oh, yeah, the government shouldn't have anything to do with the economy except that we want to make sure that they protect our interests, right? And our interests are, I'm going to make lots of money. So if I'm big pharma, I'm going to make sure that the government acts in a way that makes sure that my company, my industry makes lots of money. And if I'm in coal or fossil fuels, I want to do the same thing, whatever it is, right? So what ends up happening then is that rather than the government keeping its hands off this les fair, the government actually becomes the interest of the bourgeoisie, the capitalist class, right? You guys follow me here again, I'm not a communist, but this is actually the way it works. Okay? You can look at it and see. But now here's what's really interesting, is that people who are capitalists will say, well, the government shouldn't have anything to do with private industry, pretty much only when it comes to labor relations. Because what they're saying is the government should never step in and advocate for the working class, right? Instead, the government is supposed to be on the side of the owners. You see what I'm saying? So that's that argument that you hear. You hear people who are conservatives and say, well, the government should keep its hands off, right? Well, yeah. If they want the government to keep its hands off, then stop having the government do your bidding, essentially, right? That makes sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? Okay, well, anyway, that's the reality of it, all right? I think it's funny that. I think it's funny talking about less affair like hands off during the whole coronavirus and everything. We're just like pumping trillions into the stock market or the economy to try to keep it alive so that it wouldn't go under. But that's the government getting involved in capitalism, basically, and other people's when they should just leave their hands off. Well, yeah, I agree. The thing, though, is, and one of the things that we'll see as we go further into the course is that let's say fair capitalism is an unconscionably brutal system because it ends up with a very tiny group of people having enormous amounts of wealth and almost everybody else having nothing. Okay? That's the way, if you leave it unregulated, that's what it will happen. And so what happens in the 19th and 20th centuries is that different governments will intervene in different ways to regulate, let's say, fair capitalism, right? So in the United States, it was the progressives and it was the New Deal, the great society, maybe some of the stuff that Biden's trying to do now in England and other places in Europe, it's government ownership of industries so that industries aren't able to exploit the people. But the point is that all of these things are moves to mitigate Leslie faire capitalism. Because if you don't mitigate Leslie fair capitalism, the big kind of consequence of that more than likely would be revolution. Because when people are dying, they don't just lay down in the street and die. All right, well, the one last thing that kind of comes from this, then, is going to be the rise of the middle class. All right? The middle class, remember when we talked about the feast, the feudal system? There were lords and there were peasants, right? And then when we get into the industrial age, there are bourgeoisie and there are proletarians. But one of the things that happens is that because of the complexity of machinery in the industrial era, becomes necessary to educate workers. Workers end up going into work with more than just their labor. They go in there with knowledge, right? And that knowledge is something that they can bargain with, all right? And so what ends up happening is there's a new class that's created. It's kind of a managerial class. Somebody has to be there to manage the factory, to run the factory. Owners can't do it anymore, and workers can't work. Right. Without somebody running the factory, essentially. And that's going to be the rise of the middle class. Okay? One of the things that you should think about, and this is actually what happened in the United States, is that when the middle class exercises its power, the middle class becomes the ruling class. Okay? So if we look at, for example, after the progressive era, the middle class essentially ran. They were the ruling class, I guess you could say same thing in a way after the new deal. And one of the ways you can know it is that people who are running for office used to try to convince everybody that they were just like you, the middle class. Right? But that's what it used to be like. How many of you guys have heard politicians lately say, oh, you should vote for me because I'm working at a McDonald's or something like that? Right? Nobody says that, okay? Except for AOC used to be a bartender. Right? But at any rate, the point here is that the middle class, if it exercises its power because of the golden rule, will be the ruling class. The problem is almost everywhere, and now, including the United States, the working class works against its own interests. It supports people who are against their interests. And that's something that's called false consciousness. We'll just leave that for now. Right. But at any rate, we could see it in the United States that the middle class was the robust ruling class in the middle of the 20th century. Okay, questions, comments about this? So that is one of the results, then, of industrial realization is this rise of democracy."

","Now we turn our attention to the structure of the federal government established by the constitution. This system divides the powers of government among three distinct the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Each branch plays a critical role in the governing process. The legislative branch, as its name suggests, is primarily responsible for crafting laws. It's the engine that generates the legal framework for our nation. The executive branch, on the other hand, take center stage in implementing those laws. It's the arm that carries out the will of the legislature and ensures the smooth functioning of government on a daily basis. The judicial branch occupies a unique position. Unlike the other two branches, its core function isn't explicitly defined in the Constitution. This ambiguity led to early debates concerning the power of the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary to interpret laws for the states. As we'll explore in future lectures, the concept of judicial review gradually emerged, solidifying the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutionality. In essence, the Supreme Court's pronouncements became the final word on what constitutes lawful and unlawful actions under the Constitution. So we have a system where the legislature proposes, the executive executes, and the judiciary interprets, with each branch serving as a check on the power of the others. This intricate system of checks and balances is a cornerstone of american democracy. The executive branch is presided over by the president, who holds the pivotal role of overseeing various departments, such as the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Commerce, among others. These departments collectively form the administrative apparatus through which the federal government operates. The president's primary responsibility, as mandated by the Constitution, is the enforcement of laws. The method by which the president is elected is distinctive utilizing a mechanism known as the electoral College. This system may have come to your attention during recent electoral disputes in states such as Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. These disputes were not predicated on the notion that the vote was narrowly contested in terms of the popular vote. Indeed, in the most recent election, there was a significant difference in the popular vote between the two principal candidates. However, the margin of victory within the electoral college was comparatively narrower. The electoral college is constituted based on a formula that includes the number of representatives a state has in the House of Representatives plus its two senators. This structure means that states like California have a significant number of electoral votes due to their large representation in the House, whereas states with minimal representation, such as Wyoming, have fewer electoral votes. In a presidential election, candidates present a slate of electors in each state who pledge to vote for them. The system in most states awards all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote within that state, a mechanism known as the winner takes all system. This can result in a scenario where a candidate who wins the popular vote nationally may not win the presidency if they do not secure a majority of the electoral votes. The requirement for a majority, as opposed to a plurality, is crucial. In the electoral college, a majority necessitates more than half of the electoral votes, while a plurality is merely the largest share of votes that does not need to surpass the halfway mark. This distinction underscores the potential for a candidate to ascend to the presidency without winning the majority of the popular vote, a situation that has occurred in several instances throughout american history. The experiences and philosophical inclinations of the founders led them to harbor concerns about concentrating too much power in any single entity, whether it be a central government or the populace at large. Their weariness of a strong central government stemmed from their adverse experiences with the british parliament, while their fear of populist rule was fueled by the unruly mob actions that precipitated the constitutional convention. This dual concern motivated the drafters to devise a system that would mitigate these risks by introducing a mediating layer between the election of the president and the will of the people. The electoral college was conceived as this buffer aimed at preventing the direct election of a president by the populace. The underlying fear was that without such a mediating mechanism, the public might be swayed by momentary passions or manipulated by demagogues, leading to the election of unqualified or unsuitable candidates. To illustrate, imagine a scenario in which, in a wave of national disillusionment with politics, the electorate decides and masks to vote for a purely symbolic or facetious candidate, such as a well known cartoon character. The electoral college in this construct serves as a safeguard that would theoretically prevent the installation of such a candidate into the presidency irrespective of the popular vote. This mechanism allows electors the discretion to override the popular choice if deemed necessary for the nation's well being. Historically, this aspect of the electoral college has come into play in various forms, as seen in attempts to influence or change electors votes in recent elections. Such maneuvers underscore the electoral college's role as a check on the direct power of the electorate over the executive branch, embodying the founders intent to balance democratic participation with a safeguard against potential excesses of direct democracy. It is important to note that while there have been electors who changed their votes, referred to as faithless electors in various elections, no national election has ever been decided by faithless electors. The primary rationale behind the electoral college's creation was to ensure a moderated and deliberative process for electing the president, reflecting a profound concern for both the stability of the republic and the prevention of tyranny. Whether originating from a monarch or a mob, the secondary rationale behind the establishment of the electoral college relates to the framers vision of the United States as a federation of states, each possessing a degree of autonomy and influence over national affairs. This perspective is rooted in the constitutional principle that the president should be elected through a process that reflects the states role in the federal structure rather than through a direct popular vote. An intriguing aspect of the US constitution is its provision allowing states considerable leeway in determining the method for selecting electors. Initially, this flexibility meant that in the first presidential election, electors were predominantly appointed by state legislatures rather than being chosen through a popular vote. This arrangement underscored the notion that the election of the president was a matter for the states to decide, reflecting their sovereign status within the union. It was only subsequently that states began to establish laws prescribing the election of electors by the people, a shift that gradually democratized the process. However, the constitution's original language maintains the states prerogative to decide how electors are chosen, a testament to the enduring importance of federalism in the american political system. The office of the president is defined by a four year term with the possibility of re election. Notably, the constitution originally imposed no limit on the number of terms a president could serve. This absence of a term limit led to the establishment of a two term tradition by George Washington, who voluntarily stepped down after his second term. This precedent of relinquishing power after two terms persisted until Franklin D. Roosevelts four elections to the presidency. In the 1930s and early 1940s, in response to Roosevelt's unprecedented tenure, the constitution was amended to restrict the presidency to two consecutive terms, reinforcing the principle of periodic leadership renewal. As a safeguard for democracy, the primary function of the legislature is to create laws. However, the structure of this branch is unique. The United States Congress is considered bicameral, meaning it consists of two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate. This bicameral structure emerged from a key debate during the constitutional convention. One faction argued for a unicameral legislature with equal representation for each state. This approach ensured that the voice of each state, regardless of size, would be heard. However, others countered that such a system would give undue power to less populous states, effectively diminishing the influence of larger states and their citizens. Imagine, for instance, that Delaware had the same number of representatives as Virginia. In this scenario, the people of Virginia would have considerably less influence on the government compared to their counterparts in Delaware. On the other hand, a legislature based solely on population would overwhelm the voices of citizens in smaller states. Delaware, with its significantly smaller population compared to Virginia, would find its voice drowned out. The solution crafted by the founding fathers was a bicameral legislature that incorporated elements of both proposals. The House of Representatives reflects population distribution. The number of representatives allotted to each state is directly tied to its population, ensuring a proportional voice for more populated states. To maintain this balance, a census is conducted every ten years to determine any necessary adjustments in representation. This explains the recent census and the potential for states like California to gain or lose representatives based on population shifts. The Senate, however, takes a different approach. Originally, senators were not elected by the people, but rather appointed by state legislatures or governors. This system ensured that the interests of the states themselves were directly represented within the federal government. In simpler terms, the Senate champions the interests of the states as a whole, while the House champions the interests of the people. The 17th amendment, ratified in 1913, changed how senators are chosen. Today, senators are directly elected by the people within their respective states and serve six year terms with the possibility of re election. Similarly, members of the House serve two year terms with the opportunity to be re elected by their constituents. There are no term limits for either senators or representatives. As long as they continue to win elections, they can serve in Congress indefinitely. This might explain the presence of some senators well into their eighties and nineties. The judiciary holds the responsibility of determining whether laws passed by the legislative branch and actions taken by the executive branch comply with the supreme law of the land, the Constitution. This power is central to the concept of checks and balances within the american political system. Federal judges, including those on the Supreme Court, are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Unlike elected officials in the other branches, federal judges enjoy lifetime tenure. They serve until they retire, pass away, or are removed from office through impeachment. The recent passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Antonin Scalia exemplify this. We had also seen instances of retirement, such as that of Justice John Paul Stevens, and resignation, like that of Justice Anthony Kennedy. While the judiciary may not garner the daily spectacle associated with the legislative or executive branches, its power is arguably the most consequential. Judicial pronouncements hold significant weight. There are only two ways a judicial decision can be overturned. The court itself can reverse its stance, though this is uncommon, or the Constitution can be amended. A complex and challenging process. In essence, the judiciary acts as the silent guardian of the constitution, ensuring that the other branches function within the boundaries established by this foundational document. Their rulings have the potential to shape the course of the nation, making the judiciary a vital pillar of american democracy. Consider, in the original design of the federal government, only a single branch, the House of Representatives, was directly elected by the people. Why this limited mandate? The founding fathers harbored a degree of distrust towards the general populace. Fearing the inherent volatility of an unrestrained majority, there was genuine concern that placing too much power in the hands of the people could lead to societal instability and undermine the fledgling government. This philosophy was heavily inspired by the writings of John Locke, particularly his emphasis on the protection of property rights. The prevailing belief among the founders was twofold. Firstly, only property owners had a true stake in the nation, as articulated in Locke's work, and secondly, that ownership fosters a sense of responsibility and aligns individual interests with the broader interests of the country. Conversely, those lacking property might prioritize their own well being over that of the nation. This deliberate structure, with limited direct input from the citizenry, was further reinforced by the complex system of checks and balances we see embedded in our constitution. Understand, this was no accident. Imagine introducing a new law. It must laboriously navigate committees, pass through both legislative chambers, reconcile potential discrepancies, earn presidential approval, and even then face legal challenges in the courts. Efficient, certainly not effective at preventing any single individual or faction from exercising undue power. Absolutely. The fear the founding fathers held was not limited to the potential excesses of the people, but also to the potential tyranny of a centralized government. Their own experience with british rule had shown that efficiency often came at the cost of individual liberty. Hitlers regime exemplified a chillingly effective government where commands were carried out with unquestioning obedience. The american system, while often frustratingly slow, was designed as a safeguard against such unchecked power. When we hear criticisms of gredlock in Washington, it's important to remember that this was exactly the outcome the founders envisioned. They embrace the idea that the government which governs least, governs best. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","Now we're going to move forward to the election of 1860. Right. In 1860, the republican party chooses Lincoln as their, as their standard bearer. And the, again, the Republicans stand for no expansion of slavery. Okay. Now we'll just leave it at that for now. We'll talk more about it next on Wednesday. But anyway, in 1860, the Lincoln and the Republicans run on the issue of no expansion of slavery. Democratic party divides essentially into three different parties, northern Democrats, southern Democrats. There's actually two democratic current party conventions. And then there's another party that forms called the Constitutional Union Party, which essentially just means Tennessee and Kentucky and Virginia. Right. And so out of all that, because the opposition to the Republicans is so divided, republican party wins. Right. But keep in mind that the republican party isn't even on the ballot in the south. Right. So now if you're living in the south and your big issue is the expansion of slavery or slavery, right. And you see the federal interest in slavery as being against the constitution, and now you see somebody who actually stands for limiting the expansion of slavery elected to the presidency with no votes from the south. What does that make you think about being some from the south? How much influence do you actually have now in the national government? None. None. And so from that point of you, then they say, well, if we can't, we don't have any influence at all in the national government. There's no point in us even being in the government. You guys follow I'm saying? And so then states start to secede from the union. Which state do you think is the first one to secede? North Carolina. Which one? South Carolina. South Carolina, exactly. And why is that? Because you can't go any further south than South Carolina in terms of the issues of the civil war. Right. So anyway, before Lincoln is inaugurated, keep in mind that inauguration happened in March, then not in January. Right. But before Lincoln is inaugurated, seven states are already going to have seceded from the south. Okay. And I'm not sure it's going to be North Carolina. South Carolina, Georgia, Florida. 123-4567 I guess it's not North Carolina. But anyway, Texas was one. At any rate, the south has already succeeded. They've passed ordinances of secession. Okay, Jen, I'm going to post a document here for you that you can look at. What you'll notice in the ordinance of secession is that they almost all state as their reason for secession, states rights. But they also pretty specifically mentioned that the right that they are defending is the right to own people as property. Right. So there's a kind of a trope, I guess, that you can say has come about in the 20th century about the civil war not really being about slavery but really being about states rights. Right. And you can say that, but you can't say states rights without saying slavery because that's the right that they were defending and they said it themselves, outlaw out loud, openly in their ordinances. Right. So I'm gonna go ahead and I'll give you a document you guys can read and then you can comment on that. All right? And so let's just say right now states have already started to secede, but there are still efforts in Congress to try to come up with a compromise to keep the states in the union. Okay? So we'll just leave it right there and then Wednesday we'll come back and we'll pick it up with the civil war. All right. Questions, comments about any of this."

","Now, last thing I want to talk about, and this is an important thing for a number of reasons, right? But one of the reasons why the south believed that they could win the war in the beginning was because they were the major supplier of cotton to the british textile factories, and they believed that the British would try to preserve that relationship if they had to by allying with the Confederacy. Okay? And there was some. Some. They did consider it seriously, but it never happened. And the reason why was because by now, the british public is steadfastly against slavery, and Lincoln has, by now, made slavery the issue of the war. Right. He does it by this exact incident that we're going to talk about here. But we got to keep in mind that, remember that when Lincoln was elected, his promise was not to abolish slavery, but to limit slavery. And so even when we get to 1863 or even 1865, at the end of the war and after Lincoln is dead, slavery is still legal in Louisiana, Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware. These were all states that stayed in the Union even though they were slave states, and slavery was still legal in those states during the civil war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this, all right? But now Lincoln knows that if he can make the war about slavery, that will make it less likely that the British will intervene. And so what he's looking for is an opportunity to make an announcement about emancipation. Emancipation means freeing. Freeing the slaves, right? The problem is, as I mentioned to you guys, from the very beginning, most people think the south is winning, right? And so he feels that if he announces emancipation while everybody thinks the south is winning, it'll just be seen as a desperation move. Okay, so he waits until after the battle of Antietam. The battle of Antietam was, if you'll recall, the first major victory of the Union against the Confederacy. And then he announces his emancipation plan, right? His emancipation plan is that on the first day of January, 1863, all the slaves will be freed. Well, not quite. Okay, here's what it actually says. It says, on the first day of January, the year of our Lord, 1863, all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of the state. The people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward and forever free. Okay, how many slaves were freed by the emancipation Proclamation? It's an exact number. Zero. Zero. Do you see why? Do you see why the emancipation proclamation freed zero slaves crippled the south from any kind of, like. Well, yeah, it is that. Okay, you're right about that. But just think about what it says here, any state or designated part of a state the people were of shall then be in rebellion against the United States. What would that place. Where would those places be? Anybody can answer. How about Igor? In the south? Yeah, exactly. In the south. And how much authority does Lincoln's executive order have in the south? Do the southern States acknowledge Lincoln's executive orders? No. No. It would be like. It would be like if President Biden signed an order saying everybody in Mexico City gets ice cream. Right? Would that mean everybody in Mexico City gets ice cream? Who would connect? Who would, who in Mexico City would get ice cream based on Biden's order? Nobody. You follow what I'm saying here? And keep in mind that after the emancipation Proclamation, slavery continued in Kentucky and Missouri and Delaware, Maryland. Right. And Louisiana. Okay. All the way up until the 13th amendment, which is after Lincoln is already dead. Okay, so the emancipation proclamation doesn't free any slaves. Really? It practically. But what it really. What it does do is it makes slavery the issue of the civil war, and it prevents the British from actually intervening in the war. And it also, because the word gets out among the slave population in the south, it also deprives the south of labor because the slaves are going to start to desert their plantations and follow the Union army around. Okay, you guys are with me. So even though the emancipation proclamation doesn't actually free any slaves, it actually does help to bring about an end to the war. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Well, that's my story, and I'm sticking with it. Live long and prosper."

","Now, let's take a look at the two different sides here. The north. Again, the interest of Abraham Lincoln was to save the union in terms of resources. They had a larger population. They had an industrial economy, a booming industrial economy. They had industry. They could, they could manufacture things like guns and uniforms and stuff like that. And they had all the materials they needed because they controlled the west and they had the mines in Nevada and in California. And so the north had every advantage going into the war. Just like at the beginning of the American Revolution, the British had every advantage going into the war. Okay? So the strategy for the north is going to be, let's just crush them. Let's build a huge army and just crush them. And so the plan that was put in place to defeat the south at the beginning of the war was called the Anaconda plan. The anaconda is a snake, as you guys may or may not know. And the way that it kills its prey is by squeezing them to death. Right? So the idea here was that we were going to blockade the south to keep them from trading, to get money for their war effort. And at the same time, there's going to be an invasion in the west and in the east. Okay? And the idea then is to squeeze the life out of the south. That's the, that's the strategy of that, that Lincoln approved at the beginning of the war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. The problem with this is that Lincoln could not find a general to carry out his plan. And the reason for that is because the generals in the army generally were more concerned about politics than they were about winning battles. Every, all the generals in the army thought that they, or hoped that they would have a political future. And they all knew from the experience of George Washington and Andrew Jackson that the way to gain popularity is by winning battles. But the way to lose popularity is by losing battles. So they were very cautious. They did not want to fight any battles that they might lose because that would hurt their political chances. You guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? And so the result then is that Lincoln can't get the generals to execute his plan. And I'm going to show you how that works here in just a few minutes. All right. All right. So now the south, they're at every disadvantage, right? They, they have less population. Much of the population is enslaved. They don't have very much industry. There's a little bit of industry in Alabama and in Virginia. And so they're at a, they're, they're at a numerical and a strategic disadvantage. But they're fighting for their homes. One of the things that we need to keep in mind is that most of the civil war happened in the south, and that means that people were fighting to defend their homes. And it's more motivating to fight for something that's real right in front of you than it is to say, march 1000 miles from Iowa to Georgia to fight against somebody who we don't even really know what they're fighting for. Right? So the southern armies were much more motivated. Okay? And then they faced the superiority of the north or encouraged themselves with the idea that George Washington had won a war against an even greater enemy. And the reason why, according to their thinking, was because they were in the right. Okay? And the south, what we need to really understand about the south is that they believed they were on the right side. They believed they. That the issue of the abolition of slavery or the limiting of slavery was a. Was a violation of sacred property rights. Okay? And I don't know if you guys noticed, but I gave you extra credit. Right? Did you guys see the extra credit I put up? That's due next week? And there's no late, there's no late submissions on the extra credit. Right? But the extra credit talks of it. What it shows you is the declarations of causes, which is like the declarations of Independence, the southern states, okay? And each one of those calls out as a reason for secession that their rights as states had been violated by the national government or was going to be violated by the national government. Okay? And so that's where we can. We can get the. The assertion that the civil war was all about states rights. But you don't have to look very far to realize that the right that they were defending was the right to own people as property. You see what I'm saying? So you can't separate states rights from slavery. People today will say, oh, yeah, well, the south wasn't fighting to keep the slaves. The south was fighting to preserve their rights. Well, what rights? The rights to keep slaves. Right? So when people try to divert your attention from slavery as a. As the cause of the civil war, it's just smoke. They're blowing smoke. Slavery is at the very root of the cause of the civil war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? I'm gonna talk a little bit more about that in just a second. But at any rate, the point here then, is that the strategy that the south tried to implement was to just keep the war going, drag the war out, because the longer the war dragged on, the less interested people in the north were in fighting it. And that's really what had happened with the American Revolution, that the Americans just wouldn't give up. And eventually the british people said, we don't want this anymore. Just give up. And so that's going to be their strategy. And it almost works, as we're going to see before the end of today. Okay? Now, I want to just say one thing about the relationship between slavery and racism, okay? Because in the United States, slavery was race based. There were certain places. I mean, white slavery was unheard of in the United States, and. And there were places in the United States where you could not be black and not be a slave, okay? So slavery is absolutely race based in the United States, okay? Which kind of muddies the waters when we talk about racism, because we've come to think that if you're against slavery, that means you're also against racism. But this is not true, okay? That even though many people in the north now are seeing slavery as a moral evil, that doesn't mean that they recognize slaves as their equals. And in fact, most white people everywhere, the United States, see themselves as superior to black people, okay? And so when we talk about abolishing slavery, it's not necessarily true that we mean to make former slaves equal in terms of civil rights, okay? There. There were many people who believed that slavery was a moral evil, but couldn't imagine that these slaves could become equal citizens. And even Lincoln went through a phase like that where Lincoln said slavery was wrong, but he could never imagine the former slaves as being equal to white people. So his solution was to send them back to Africa. What's the problem with sending them back to Africa? Most of them have been born here, right? Yeah. They're not from Africa. They're born here. Right? That's why the 15th amendment says that in order to be a citizen, you have to be born in the United States, right? If you're born in the United States, then you're a citizen. It's for that reason that makes all of the slaves, the former slaves, citizens. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this? Okay, well, here's. Here's the thing. So anyway, the point here is then that when we talk about the animosity between the north and the south, this animosity isn't really an issue of race. It's an issue of union and property rights, okay? And those property rights center on the issue of ownership of human beings, right? And. But. And so we could say that maybe in the north. The north. People in the north were anti slavery, and people in the south were pro slavery. But in fact, generally speaking, people in the north couldn't care less about slavery. They wanted to preserve the union, and people in the south also could. Most people didn't own slaves, but they became convinced that the national government was violating states rights. Okay, you guys follow I'm saying here, but we can say that there was an equal amount of racism across the country. It's not like people in the north were not racist and people in the south were racist. Everybody was racist, okay? And that's going to be true all the way into the 20th century. Think about this. In 1952, I think, let's say 1947, Jackie Robinson was the first black player in the major leagues, right? Well, was that the southern major leagues or was that the american major leagues? You guys get what I'm saying here? And in 1952, Harry TRuman's integrated the armed services. Was that the southern armed services or was that the american armed services? You guys follow what I'm saying here? So slavery is. I mean, racism is something that's very american. It's not just in the south. Okay, you guys are all with me. Questions, comments about this. Okay? So now, the one thing about when the war started was that people in the north and the south, if there's some kind of an insanity that goes through people's minds when a war, when there's a prospect of a war, that it's going to be something really good. It's going to be really glorious. We're going to go and we're going to fight, and it's going to be like, we're going to go have a football game, and at the end of the football game, we. We're all going to gain glory, and that's going to make our lives so much better. But in fact, war is a destroyer, and it's not until you're in it that you realize how bad that it is. But there was a lot of enthusiasm, both in the north and the south, for signing up and going to war. Okay? Now, one last thing I want to do here before we move on is I want to. This slide I put together really, I think, encapsulates the differences between the north and the south that lead to the war. We've already seen this quote by John Calhoun from the south where he's saying that, that there is no. There's going to be no compromise on the issue of slavery. Right? And now this is something that you may or may not have ever heard from Abraham Lincoln where he said, this is actually toward the beginning of the war, I would save the union. I would save it in the shortest way under the constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the union will be to the union as it was. If there be those who would not save the union unless they could, at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the union unless they could, at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the union without freeing any slave, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. So now, what is Lincoln saying here? That all he really cares about is saving the union? He doesn't really care about slavery. So slavery is not his issue. His issue is union. He won't compromise on that. But the south won't compromise on the issue of slavery. Okay, you guys are with me. So this is actually just a couple of days before his death, before he was assassinated, he summed up the civil war this way. Both parties deprecated war. I mean, we thought it was a bad thing. Both parties deprecated war. But one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came."

","Now, the thing about the attack on Pearl harbor is that, as I mentioned, the United States went essentially overnight from being isolationist and neutral to fully in full support of the war. One of the things that we need to really try to imagine is that this period in american history is probably the only period in american history where almost everybody was unified, okay? Because there was a national sense that the whole country was threatened and that it was the patriotic duty of every American to do what they could to support this war, okay? And so, so America, essentially, it was almost like this peer pressure that was created where if you weren't in favor of the war, you were an enemy, right? You get what I'm saying? Okay? And here's what I want you to contrast that with. Okay? Contrast that with the fact that the United States has been at war in Asia since before you guys were born, okay? And most of us don't even know about it. We have really little to know. We all know that there's troops in Afghanistan. We think there might be troops otherwere elsewhere in the Middle east, right? And there are troops all over Africa that most of us don't even know about, right? But the point of it all is that America has been fighting wars that we're not involved in. It's certainly not a total war. What's a total war? Isn't it like war between every nation of the world or involvement of the people? Exactly. It's the whole nation against the whole nation, right? So in world War two, when we were talking about fighting the war, everybody was involved, everybody was rationed. Little kids were out picking up scrap metal, and people were donating their bacon grease, right, to help the war effort. You see what I'm saying? Everybody's involved, okay? And you can't imagine that today, right? I mean, we could look at what happened after 911, which many of you probably don't remember at all, right? After 911, Americans were unified for about three days, and then America divided itself up again. Right? Americans divided themselves up again. Okay? So this, this idea of creating this unity based on a threat to the United States is something that's kind of unique to World War two. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about that? Okay, so now question. Did we see the same level of, like, anti german sentiment during World War two as we did in World War one? Not as much. But one of the reasons why was because many of the people who were descended from Germans had changed their names. Remember that the only way you could actually tell somebody was german was by their name. So many of the people who had been harassed during World War one had changed their family names to something that was more anglicized. And the result of that then was that it's much more difficult to identify who's German. You see what I'm saying? But it wasn't hard for them to identify who was japanese. You see what I'm saying? Because there's a visible. There's a visible characteristics, right? Does that make sense? So then the answer is that there wasn't as much anti german sentiment because there wasn't as much of a visible presence of Germans in the United States or german and people of german ancestry. All right, so let's go then to. This is basically what we were talking about, this idea of total war. And if you're going to have a total war in a democracy, who's going to manage the total war? What government? We talked about this in World War one. The federal government. The federal government, exactly. So we saw that the federal government took on powers that it never had before during World War one, which were mostly powers of persuasion. But in world War two, we saw the United States essentially take control of the economy and also to enforce its, its policy using, I forgot what they call it now. Rationing. Rationing. Now, here's the thing that the United States government started to tell private industry, okay, we need you to build this, and we need you to build this much. Okay? So United States government tells, say, Ford or GM, okay, we need you to make 100,000 airplanes, right? And then the industry does do that. They hire people and they start producing these things. Right. And they don't mind the fact that the government is actually telling them what to do, even though the government's supposed to be laissez faire, hands off. Right. But the reason why they don't mind is because they weren't making anything. They were in depression, right? And not only that, the United States pays well. Okay? So this was a great opportunity for them. And one of the things that you'll notice when you read that book, the stories in that book, the good War, is that there were people, there was one person in particular who got a job in a war industry factory who was just thrilled that the United States was at war because she was able to afford to buy a refrigerator, right. That she couldn't do that before. So she was happy there was a war. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay. Any rate, the United States takes control of the. Of the economy, and then they take control of american. That was the american attitude, essentially. And they do that in the same way in world War two as they did in World War one. So let's take a look at a couple of these propaganda posters. Let's look at this one first. What do we see here? We see, like, Hitler coming after the US. It's Hitler and Tojo. They look like they're happy people. No, like, angry. And to cause, like, fear and anxiety. Exactly. They're very, they're very threatening people. And what are they threatening? I mean, it's not like it's. It's not like it's nuanced in any way. What does it say? Our homes. You can see the picture of them on the bottom here. Our homes are in danger now. See our homes down here? They're in danger now. And so what do we need to do? Keep them firing. Right. And so what that does is it instills this sense of fear in the people of the United States, but at the same time, it also creates a sense of unity. Right. You follow what I'm saying? So this is almost, this is not, in some ways, it's not different from what Hitler did in Germany by declaring the Jews to be an enemy. Right. I'm not saying that the United States government was anti semitic or racist. What I'm saying is that they use the same human propensity to create unity in America. Right. That unity's created what defines us as Americans are enemies. Our enemies are what defines us. Right. You follow what I'm saying here? Okay. And let's take a look at this one then. Down here, right? What do we see here? What are these things? Those are snakes. Like saying that Germany or snakes. Yeah, Germany and Japan. Asia. Yeah, Japan. What about frog? I don't know either. But anyway, I don't know what the frog is, but at any rate, the point here is that what are we doing? We're, we're you supposed to do with snakes? Stomp them out. Stomp them out. You're not supposed to, you're not supposed to like snakes. You're not supposed to care about snakes. You're supposed to kill them. Right. Okay, so why do you think we're portraying the Germans and the Japanese as snakes? Because we're not supposed to like them. Yeah. So we can kill them just like, just like we saw in World War one with the Germans being gorillas, right? They were gorillas in world War one, but now in world War two, they're snakes. So that's a kind of a miracle of biology. But at any rate, the point here is it's a, it's a matter of dehumanization so that you can, you can instill hatred, right? You're really not supposed to hate other people, but you can hate snakes. You know what I'm saying? Are you with me? Questions? Comments? Okay, so, I mean, and that's the, that's really the bottom line in war, right? The bottom line in war is that you have to force people to believe that they hate other people. And the way that you do that is to make those other people not people."

","Okay, let's go on now. I'm going to talk a little bit now about the different visions. I'm going to talk particularly about Jefferson's vision of the country. Jefferson's vision is that the model citizen in the United States should be a single family farmer. The idea was to create an agrarian middle class, a middle class of farmers who would raise enough on their farm to support themselves and their families and have a little bit left over to sell so they could buy luxuries. And so the idea here isn't that somebody is going to be incredibly prosperous. I should say they're not going to be rich, but they will be prosperous and they'll be comfortable. And the idea then is that they can live out on their farms and they can live their kind of middle class lives and they would not have to worry about politics and they wouldn't have to worry about world affairs and they could just enjoy their liberty. You guys follow me here. That's the idea. Okay. The idea is that, is that the, the country, the ideal citizen would be a landowner. Jefferson called it a yeoman farmer. That's y e o m a n. But what he really means is a land, a single family farmer who owns the land. Well, why is it so important for them to own the land? The answer to that is because if you own the land, then you're more likely to care for it. Okay, so the idea really comes from the greek city states going all the way back to, you know, BC, right, where, for example, in Athens or in Sparta, you could vote. There was a democracy there, but you could only vote if you owned land. And the reason why was because if you owned land, that meant that the welfare of the city state was the same as your own welfare. So the idea here is that if you own part of the country, then the country's welfare is the same as your welfare. It's kind of like if you, if you go out, if you have a car, if you own a car, you don't want somebody to puke in it. But if you rent a car, you don't care if somebody pukes in it because you don't have it, you don't care about it, right? And it's the same thing here with tea. So when, when Hamilton thought that people should be, people should be, you know, working in industry, well, those industrial, the industry is going to be in the cities, right? And in the cities, they're not going to own the land. They're going to rent their tenements, whatever they, they live in apartments or whatever, right? And. And because they rent, they don't care. They don't care about the. The only care about is their own interests. You. You're following me here, right? So Jefferson thought that if we had a country that was made up of landowners, that they would act in favor of the country and that would create a republic of virtue. We call it a republic of virtue. And the virtue is built in because of your own self interest. Your self interest is the same as the state's self interest. You guys get what I say? All right, so that's going to be Jefferson's idea. And that means then that, well, we have to have a lot of land, okay? Because if everybody's going to be a farmer, there's got to be land. Okay, guys, with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so let's talk, then about the Louisiana purchase. Okay? Now let's think about America in 18. That's when Jefferson was elected president, actually, 1801. Right. And most of the people in the country lived here along the eastern seaboard. Right? But a number of people were moving into the Ohio river valley. Okay, we have talked about the Ohio river valley before because that's where the war, the seven, the french and indian war was really begun by. By George Washington. But the people in the Ohio river valley made a living from farming. They grew corn and they would sell their product in the east. But what was the product? Did they actually sell corn? Were they selling popcorn or. What was it. What did they do to the corn before they sold it? It would turn it into something. Remember I told you just a minute ago about the rebellion in western Pennsylvania? What was that rebellion? Whiskey. Whiskey, exactly. So they. They would turn the corn into whiskey, and then they would sell it in the east. But unlike today, it was very difficult to get from the Ohio river valley to the east because of the mountains. And so it was much easier for the farmers in. In this area to load their whiskey on barges that would go down the Ohio river and then down the Mississippi river. And then they would put their. Their goods on the docks in New Orleans. So they had what was called right of deposit, meaning they could deposit their goods on the docks in New Orleans and then in New Orleans, american trading vessels could pick up the cargo and bring it to the east. And it was much easier to do that than it was to try to drag all that stuff over the mountains because there weren't any roads. Okay. It was basically, you had to drag everything. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? All right. So the problem is going to be this in 18 France. See this. This area. Let me go back further. In the seven years war, remember that France had previously owned this land, actually, all of this land, but they lost it in the french and indian war. Seven years war. And this. Remember, this part was under the rule of the British, and this part was under the rule of the Spanish. But in 1803, France invaded Spain, and as a result of that, they acquired Louisiana. Okay? The reason why they acquired Louisiana was because there was this. They were trying to reestablish a slave trade in a. In a little island called phantoming, which is where Haiti is today. And when you have plantation agriculture like they had in. In Haiti or in Saint Domingue, you don't actually grow food there. And so what happened was that France, under Napoleon, had acquired Louisiana so that he could grow food to. To feed the slaves in Saint Domingue. Okay? And that was in 1801. Okay, here's the problem that the. The French. Well, first off, let me just go here, right? When the French took over this territory, they closed the Mississippi to american commerce, and the. They revoked Americans right of deposit, which meant that the farmers then in western Pennsylvania had nowhere to sell their products, and that meant that this was a real economic crisis for them. Okay? In the meantime, the attempt by the French to reestablish slavery in Saint Domingue is going to fail. And so it will happen then that after acquiring Louisiana, Napoleon will realize he has no need for it. And so what happens then is that Jefferson sends an emissary, a representative, to negotiate with France for the sale of New Orleans. The idea being, if the United States buys New Orleans and has rights of passage on the Mississippi, then they'll be able to resume their whiskey trade. Okay, you guys are with me. But once this guy gets there, his name is Livingston. Once Livingston gets there, Napoleon has already realized he doesn't need Louisiana for anything. So he agrees to sell Louisiana to the United States for $15 million. Now, this is incredibly important because this is an empire. I mean, look at the size of this territory. It's bigger than any of the european countries, right? And the United States now has an opportunity to buy an empire. Okay? So now this is an opportunity that people can't. Nobody can turn this down, right? $50 million is almost nothing. I mean, even in those days, it was almost nothing. Right, in terms of the amount of territory that you would acquire. And no country in the world had ever been able to buy an empire, right? But here, the United States has this opportunity. But Jefferson has an ideological problem. Does anybody want to tell me what this problem is and think about the difference between the federalists and the democratic Republicans in terms of their interpretation of the constitution, because Jefferson is. What, what is he? Democratic, republican or federalist? Democratic. Republican. Right. He's a democratic Republican. And what do the democratic Republicans say about the constitution? How should it be interpreted? Strictly or loosely? Strictly. Okay. So now, now having said that, do you see the problem that Jefferson has with buying Louisiana? With the federal government buying Louisiana, you would have to assign more power to the federal government in order to gain this purchase. Right. Because what does the constitution say about the president's ability to buy territory? It doesn't. It doesn't say anything. You guys have read it. Did you see anywhere in there where it said, oh, yeah, the president can buy a territory? It doesn't say that. Right. And so if we. If Jefferson is a strict constructionist, which he is, then that would mean he really doesn't have the authority to buy this territory. But how can you turn this territory down? And so even though there was there, he had some, you know, ideological problems with it, he went ahead with it anyway. The United States buys the Louisiana territory. And then. And then after that, you guys have probably all heard of Lewis and Clark. There was an expedition that actually started here in Pennsylvania, went down the Ohio, up the Mississippi and the Missouri. And then they walked across the mountains and they went to the west coast and spent the winter on the west coast in what's today Washington. Okay, now, now keep in mind here that when the United States bought Louisiana, nobody really knew where the limit was. Okay? It was just out there somewhere. And so there was no reason why Americans couldn't explore this territory. As it happens, this territory was actually claimed by Britain. Okay. And when. But because, I should say this way, but because Americans spent the winter on the coast in Washington, that establishes a claim by the United States. The United States will say, well, we've been there, so it's ours. And this will almost lead to. I'm sorry. This will almost lead to a war 30 or 40 years from now. We'll see how that turns out later. But any rate, this is going to be the purchase of Louisiana. The reason why Jefferson wanted to buy Louisiana was he felt that this would be a perfect landscape for his agrarian. His agrarian vision, I guess. The agrarian republic, where there's been a lot of land here that people can take advantage of to become yeoman farmers. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? One last thing I want to mention about that is that the federalists. Now this is kind of ironic. The federalists were against the purchase of Louisiana. And you would think, well, maybe it has something to do with the constitution, but remember, the federalists were the loose constructionists, so it would have seemed like something they would go along with. The problem was that if Jefferson gets away with buying Louisiana and making all that territory available to people, who are the people going to thank? Which political party? The Democratic Republicans. Exactly. So with the democratic Republicans gain a bunch of support from giving away land or selling it very cheaply, then that will take support away from the federalists. Right. You guys get what I'm saying? And so in order to try to maintain their power, they try to stop the sale, but they aren't able to do it. Okay. And then as part of this argument between or over Louisiana, there's going to be an incident where Hamilton, I'm not sure exactly. I don't remember exactly how it goes, but there's an incident of honor between Alexander Hamilton, who is now Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr, who is now vice president. And they will decide to have a duel. And the duel ends with Hamilton being killed. And then Burr escapes into the west and tries to start an empire in Kansas. Eventually, he's captured and put on trial, but he is acquitted. All right, questions, comments about any of this?"

","Okay, now let's talk about. Well, when Jefferson came into power, was he the wild eyed radical that he had been portrayed as? And the answer is no. He was. He did change the direction of the government a little bit. Right. By some of the things that had done, that had happened during the Washington and Adams administrations. He will change direction on. Right. So one thing that happened was that the Washington administration had raised excise taxes. Basically, the idea here was they raised taxes on produced goods. And there was an argument about whether the federal government could actually raise taxes on goods. The way that it was thought to be was that the federal government could raise taxes on states, but not on individual goods. Right. And the big example of this was the. When you read in the book about the whiskey rebellion, that's what that was about. That they raised the excise tax on the production of whiskey in western Pennsylvania. And the whiskey distillers rebelled, said they weren't going to pay the tax, at which point then Washington raised an army and went and marched on western Pennsylvania and put down the rebellion. And the federal excise taxes stayed. But now when Jefferson comes into power, he's going to abolish them. Okay. Because he says the federal government shouldn't have that much power. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, then the next one. Allow the alien and sedition acts to. To expire. This has to do with foreign intervention in american politics. Does this sound familiar? Right. Okay. And the idea here is that, as you guys will recall, I mentioned that there was a conflict, major conflict, between Britain and France. And both Britain and France were trying to get the United States on their side. And there were people in the United States that were in favor of both sides. If we look at, for example, Adams had really seen France as the great enemy, and then we see Jefferson, who sees England as the great enemy. But what happened was that both of those countries tried to interfere in american politics. And the response of the federalist administration, particularly Adams, was to prevent. Prevent. Well, there was a plan. The French had decided that what they were going to do was send a whole bunch of people to America to become citizens so they could vote in favor of France. And so to counteract that, the alien law was passed. The Alien act basically said that in order to become an american citizen, you have to be here for 15 years. Okay? So that kept that kind of squashed, that idea of the French taking over the american government from the. Basically from within. Okay. But the democratic Republicans thought that this was a federal overreach, that the federal government shouldn't be, shouldn't have that much power. And then the one that really rankled them was the sedition act, which basically said anybody that criticizes the president is guilty of sedition and can be thrown in jail and fined. Right. And this was seen as kind of almost like a monarchical measure. And that is going to expire during Jefferson's administration because Jefferson doesn't think that the federal government should have that much power. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about that?"
54,"US2: 126 -US2: 126
","Okay, one last thing. Imperialism. We talked about imperialism. And one of the things that we have to note is that the rise of imperialism is motivated by industrialization. And what I mean by that is, for example, if we look at England, I told you about England before. The british empire was built on textiles. Cotton textiles, right? The problem is that in England they don't grow cotton, okay? So if you're going to make cotton textiles, you got to get cotton somewhere. And at first they got it from the american colonies, but after the civil war or during the civil war, they found that that source was not reliable, so they went elsewhere, and they got it from Egypt and eventually from India. Right? Okay. So now what's happening is that England is importing cotton from India. And we would think, okay, well, that sounds okay. I mean, if we're going to have a textile factory, then I'll find somebody that has cotton and I'll say, okay, you give me your cotton and I'll give you something in return. Some money or something like that, right? But because Europeans were advanced technologically over the rest of the world, the English were able to go to India and say, look, you guys have cotton and we have guns, so if you give us your cotton, we won't kill you. Right? And that's essentially what imperialism is. Imperialism is that the people of England are able to control the resources of India through military power. So imperialism essentially is a quest for resources and markets. England needed resources to make all these cotton textiles. And once they had made all the cotton textiles, they had to have someplace to sell them. Right? So they imported the cotton from India and then they sold the textiles back to India. Right? And India was there only to create wealth for the mother country. Right? You guys follow what I'm saying? Okay. Americans are going to do this as well, but Americans are going to do it in a slightly different way, because instead of ruling other countries, the United States will find other ways to control the economy of other countries. And we'll talk more about that. I have a lecture in, like, two weeks, I think, on industrialization, right? So at any rate, the United States will be an imperial power, but it won't be like the european imperial powers or like. Because. Because the United States doesn't need to go outside of the United States or outside of the north american continent to find resources and markets until much later, right? America has access to the west, which gives them access to all the materials that they need. And the population is growing, so they have plenty of markets. Right? They don't really need to look overseas for an empire, because we have an empire right here on our own continent. You guys follow what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. Okay. But now that's the kind of economic aspect of imperialism. But there's another aspect of it as well, because what I'm doing is I'm going to your country, say, I'm going to your house, and I'm stealing your stuff, right? And I have to somehow justify that. I have to be able to justify the fact that I walked into your living room and stole your couch. Okay? And the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to say, well, I could say it one way or the other. I could say, okay, you weren't using the couch, right. Anyway, you were, like, drooling on it and stuff like that. So I'm going to take better care of the couch than you did. Right. So therefore I deserve the couch. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? Or I could say, well, you guys could keep the couch, but I need to show you how to use the couch correctly. Right. And that's going to be the western way of doing it. The western way. We're going to kind of summarize it in a phrase that's the name of a poem by Rudyard Kipling called the white man's burden. Right. The white man's burden. And the idea behind that is that the white Europeans are at the pinnacle of civilization. Why? Because they're white Europeans. Right. And everybody in the world that's not white is somehow not as advanced as the Europeans. Professor? Yes, my last professor described it as european exceptionalism, where they just view everything to do as just the pinnacle and they try to essentially save everyone else. Well, that's the, that's the ideal. That's also the ideal behind american mission and the idea behind manifest destiny, the idea that the american way is the best way and that you better do it this way. And we're going to show you how to do it. Right. Okay. But now let me go on a little bit further here, right. So it's kind of like we can think of all of the civilizations of the world as children in a family, right? When you say you're in a family, I don't know if you guys have brothers and sisters, right? But say if you're the older brother and you have a younger brother, then you feel responsibility to help that younger brother to learn the ways of life. Right? Okay. And that's the way the Europeans will think about themselves. They'll say, okay, well, we have reached this pinnacle of civilization. Our mission is to help you guys along. The British called it the civilizing mission, right? To civilize people, which is ironic if you think about it, because the people of India were civilized centuries before the Europeans, right? The people of India already had a thriving civilization while the people of the British Isles were running around in the woods naked and painting themselves blue, right? You follow what I'm saying? All right, so it's an ironic thing and it's not valid to say that there is some pinnacle of civilization that can be reached and that we're there and everybody else should be there with us. Right? But that's the driving motivation, right? So that will drive european, some european imperialism, also american imperialism. Americans go to places and they say we're here to bring democracy. Why is the United States in Iraq? Because we brought democracy. Right? Why did the United States bomb Libya? Because of democracy. You listen to any of the presidents, it could be George Bush, it could be american, it could be Barack Obama. But they both justify american military force by saying that we support democracy. Does America really support democracy? Yes, it does. Right? But America is selective about where it enforces it because they enforce it in Libya and Iraq, where there's oil, but they don't bother to enforce it in Rwanda. Right? There's a huge humanitarian crisis in Rwanda. The United States doesn't care a bit about that. You follow what I'm saying? So why do they care about Iraq but not Rwanda? You follow what I'm saying? That makes sense to you guys. Okay, so we'll just leave it at that and I'll get back and we'll talk more about that later. But the main thing is here is to make that link between. Let me just say one last thing and then I'm going to let you guys go. Right. Modernization is the dilemma of the 19th century because all of the countries in the world can be divided between those that are modernized and those that are not. And the modernized countries like Britain and France and Germany and the United States and Japan eventually are going to be modernized, meaning that they. Let me just say it this way, modernization, you should write this one down. Modernization means to look like the west. Okay, well, how does the west look? What does the west look know? It's got a swirl, cactus and tumbleweeds and stuff. No, that's not it. It's got liberalism or liberty. Guys, remember we talked about liberty the other day with the exclamation point, right? And it's also got industrialization. So to be a modernized country, you have to have liberalism and industrialization, right? And you'll see all of the industrial countries of the 19th century were both of those things, right? Other countries that are not modernized end up being essentially prey to the modernized countries, right? The dilemma is modernize or be colonized. If you cannot modernize, you will become colonized. And where we can see this really starkly is in China. China, at the beginning of the 19th century was the most powerful country on earth. The most powerful, the most prosperous, the most advanced country on earth, right? But because they believed that they had already achieved the pinnacle of civilization, they ignored the threat of the west. They said they thought of the west as a bunch of barbarians, and they didn't make any effort to modernize. And in fact, they were against modernization. They said, why should we modernize? We're already the best, right? And the result was that by the beginning of the 20th century, they're so weak that they're what they call carved up like a melon, right? China became so weak that the european powers essentially carved it up into spheres of influence. And the Americans were in on that as, okay, so that was China's lesson. Japan noticed that lesson. Japan noticed that China didn't modernize and became colonized. And their response was to deliberately modernize. So they went through this very painful modernization period called the Meiji revolution, right? And the outcome of it was that they became a modernized country. But ironically, when they became a modernized country, they also became an imperial power. They also became a colonizer. Why? Because they needed resources and markets. Right? Okay. The dilemma that we're looking at then in the 19th century is modernize or be colonized. China didn't modernize and they were colonized. Japan did modernize and they weren't colonized, but colonizers. Right? You guys follow what I'm saying? All right, so that's kind of the economic formula, I guess you could say, for the 19th century, for imperialism, and it's all driven by industry, by the industrial revolution."

","Okay, so let's keep going and let's think about. Okay, we're telling this bigger story of Jackson, and he's angry at Adams because of the corrupt bargain. He has an ally named Martin Van Buren, who also will later be president himself. But what they do is they start a new process of organizing the vote. Call it grassroots organizing, but it's organizing based on patronage, just like I had, just like I demonstrated to you guys. So they would organize a whole neighborhood, say, for example, in New York. Right, or anywhere but, say New York. And the neighborhood would be organized. Everybody in that neighborhood is going to vote for Jackson. And this is a new way of doing american politics. And the opposition wasn't ready to meet the challenge. And so the result is going to be that Jackson wins the presidency in 1828. And his win, we could say, really, he is the first truly democratically elected president in the United States because he had been able to mobilize all these new votes. He wasn't just elected by the elites. You guys get what I'm saying? All right. Okay. So. And that's going to actually end up showing in american politics, because Jackson becomes actually is the first american populist president. All right, so here's another term we need to think about. What's populism? And populism essentially is when you have a strong candidate who identifies with the common people, and because the common people are so loyal to him and so supportive of him, he is able to defy conventional norms. Right? So, for example, one of the things that we'll see, you probably already saw if you watch that video, 500 nations, is that Jackson, the supreme Court ruled that moving the Cherokee from Georgia was unconstitutional, but Jackson ignored the constitution. Why could he do that? The reason why was because he was so popular, nobody could do anything about it. You see what I'm saying? So populism, let's just take a look at it here. Populism, like I said, populists identify with an appeal. The common man. Populists are anti elite, anti big business. The United States has had two populist presidents before. Donald Trump, Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt. Populist presidents rely on popular support to circumvent constitutional restrictions. As I already mentioned, Jackson and the Cherokee. And also Theodore Roosevelt basically defied Congress and took the Panama Canal from Venezuela, I think was warned it. But at any rate, the point here is there's two different kinds of populism. There's a kind of a. An authoritarian populism and a democratic populism. Right? Authoritarian populism. Is the election of a strong man. I'm going to fix it, right? And so when he's elected or that person is elected, that person is expected to fix all the problems. Right? And then the democratic populist is somebody who says, well, I'm not going to fix all the problems. We're all going to do it together. It's a kind of a communal thing. So there's really two different approaches to populism or two different manifestations of it, okay? But either way, you end up with the same situation. Right? So when we look at, for example, in 2016, where were two candidates who were running, Donald Trump for the Republicans and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats, both of them were populists. Okay? But they were, their approach was very different. You follow what I'm saying? So, so essentially, Andrew Jackson was the result. If Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders had a baby, he would be. He would be that, because he was both, he was both a strong man, but he had this kind of popular appeal. You guys are with me on this. Questions, comments?"
56,"US2: 312 -US2: 312
","Okay, so now you guys will recall that we talked about the 1890. The frontier was closed. What does that mean? Remember we talked about that 1890 frontier was closed. There's nowhere else to go. We had nowhere else to go. And what was that going to do to american life, the fact that the frontier wasn't there anymore? Turner, what, where did the american character come from? Well, the frontier, basically exactly, is the expansion and like, kind of like the freedom you get from the frontier. Right. So there is no more frontier. What then you move on to Hawaii and the Philippines if you're in danger, if you don't, if you don't continue to expand. So it's going to be really in the 1890s that the United States starts to really look overseas for in terms of its. Of its imperial outreach. Okay? Now, that's not to say that before that, the United States wasn't and imperial power, because the United States essentially conquered the north american continent for the purpose of accessing its resources. Okay? So the United States, let's say, for example, that we're Britain, okay? And we have cotton textiles. Our economy is based on cotton textiles, but you can't grow cotton in England. Right. And so you have to go somewhere else to get it. And they got it first in the american colonies, and then they got it in Egypt and in India. Right. But what they did was they would have to go overseas to get their resources, and the United States didn't have to do that because all the resources we needed were right here on our continent. Right. And so Americans really don't look overseas for. For imperial expansion because they don't need to. Right. But then when we get to the. To the 1890s and. And what we're going to see is this is kind of the height of the imperialist era. All right? And the imperialist era, essentially what it's going to require is going to be that Americans are going to, or any country that doesn't become an imperialist country is going to fall behind. Remember, we talked, I think, at one point about the challenge in the 20th of the 19th century was either modernize or be colonized. So now the way the United States starts to acquire an overseas empire is during the spanish american war. Okay? You can read about the spanish american war in your book. Right. And you will read about that. But the upshot of it is this, that the United States had economic interests in Cuba, and it was sugar. Okay? The cuban economy was based on export of sugar, and most of those sugar exports ended up going to the United States, but Cuba was still under the control of the spanish empire. All right? And what happened was that there was a, there was an independence movement in Cuba that the Spanish were crushing, okay? And this is going to play into the american press because at the same time in the United States, there's a, there's a competition, a fierce competition between two newspaper empires, the hearsts and the Pulitzer's. Okay? And so that competition was based on who can sell the most people newspapers. And one of the ways that seemed like a good way to sell newspapers was to report sensational stories, right? You guys are probably familiar with, like if you're sitting there watching TV on, say you're on network TV, which I haven't watched in years, but say you are right, you're sitting on network TV and the commercial comes on. And then right before you go back to your program, there's a little blurb and it says, aliens land in El Cajon, film at eleven. Right, right. And so you say, oh, there's aliens in alcohol and I got to watch this news, right. And then you watch the news and all the way at the end there'll be like a 32nd segment about some little kids in Oklahoma dressed up like aliens or something like that. Right. But the point was that they got you to watch so you could see all their ads. Right. And that's the same thing that we see with these newspapers. It's called yellow journalism. Right. And the idea behind yellow journalism is you make these stories to be so appealing that everybody wants to buy, you know, and you see it all the time around you now. I mean, there's so much sensationalized news. And why is it sensationalized? Well, because it sells products. Okay. Same thing happened then. Okay. But the problem was that, that at that time, and probably still today to a certain extent, right. They often crossed the line. Essentially what they would do is make news. Right. So one of the places where we could see a lot of sensational news was in Cuba. Right. Because Cuba would jail, you know, revolutionaries and, and conduct trials and be oppressive. And Americans could read about that and they would say, oh, those, those Cubans, those poor Cubans are just like us. And their problem, our problems with the British, but their problems are with Spain. And it was very sensational. Right. And so, but for example, there was one photographer who was sent down to Cuba to take pictures of all the atrocities that were being committed. And when he got there, he cabled back to New York that he couldn't find any atrocities. And the editor said, well, you just send us the pictures and we'll make up the atrocities. You follow what I'm saying? So that's the way Americans are getting their information about what's happening in Cuba. And then the battleship Maine explodes in Havana harbor. Okay? Now, there's good reason to believe that the Spanish didn't have anything to do with blowing up the battleship Maine, okay? But it was sensationalized in America, so much so that they would actually publish newspapers with pictures. Not pictures, but drawings of spanish sailors attaching bombs to the main. Right, okay, so Americans are like, we gotta go get those spanish, right? And so America ends up declaring war against Spain. And the problem for the Spanish was that their empire was. Was teetering, right? They had nothing left, really, except for Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the philippine islands. And they had. Their. Their fleet was in such bad shape that when they tried to get underway, they sank because the rust was so heavy on the bottom of their ships, right? So the war was really almost a. Not a war, right? What Theodore Roosevelt, the american president, is going to call a splendid little war, right? Lasted like, six weeks, right? And then all of a sudden, the Americans have their. Have this empire. They've acquired what was left of the spanish empire, or they're in control of it, right? So there's Puerto Rico, and then there's. There's Cuba and then the philippine islands. All right? And so now, just stepping back a little bit here, when the United States declares war against Spain, one of the things that the United States does is to declare that they would not. They're not in the war to annex Cuba, right? So they promised in this war that they would not annex Cuba. It's called the Teller amendment, right? The idea here is that we're not doing it to gain territory. We're doing it actually to save these poor people from your oppression, essentially. Right? So what will happen then is that the United States can't annex Cuba, but there's a question about Puerto Rico and the philippine islands. And so what will happen is then that there will be a debate that happens in the United States over whether or not the United States should acquire an overseas empire. And guess what it's called? It's called the imperialist, anti imperialist debate."

","Okay, so the Americans, I guess you could say oppression, depredations continue. Americans decide to call another continental congress. This one's called the Second Continental Congress. And they come together to really try to organize a response to the British. And again, they divide into two different camps. On the one hand, the first argument is going to be, how are we going to respond? Are we going to build an army or we're going to have a national army, or are we going to just have the militias? Right. And the argument of the one group has looked at what happened in Boston, and one of the things that happened in Boston was that the British were defeated and they abandoned Boston after battle of Breeds Hill, Bunker Hill. Right. Okay. So some people are saying, well, we don't even need an army, we just need to use our militias. And again, there's always been this real reluctance to allow a standing army, I should say always up until World War II, actually. But there's always been this reluctance to allow a standing army. They don't want to have a central government that has a powerful army that can infringe upon your rights. Okay, so there was a real argument here, but the decision was made that they would try to create a continental army, and then they needed to have a commander, and they picked George Washington. Okay, now let's think about why did they pick George Washington? Well, he had some military experience. You guys will remember that he was in the Virginia militia, although he had quit the Virginia militia because they wouldn't give him a commission, the British. The other thing about Washington that was important was that he was from Virginia. Why would it be important that Washington was from Virginia? Let's think about now who was really pushing for Washington? John Adams. Does anybody remember where John Adams was from? Massachusetts. Massachusetts. Okay. And it's one of the biggest colonies. Right? The other biggest colony is which one do you. Okay, so, so now let's think about it. If you're on the right and you're being bullied, who do you want to be on your side? The biggest guy on the playground. Right. And who's the biggest guy on the playground here is Virginia. Right. So if you can get a virginian to lead your army, that's more than likely going to get Virginia on your side. Right. And that's why Washington was picked. It was actually a political decision to pick Washington so they could bring the Virginians along with them. All right, well, then we go back into our different groups, the radicals and the conservatives. The radicals include John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. And they're pushing for a declaration of independence. The conservatives are going to be a guy named John Dickinson, who was a farmer. He wrote a book called letters from a farmer in Pennsylvania, and he wanted to make up. He wanted to somehow reconcile with the British. Okay? So on the one hand, we have people pushing for independence. On the other hand, we have this idea that we should somehow make up. The public opinion at this time was probably pretty much against declaring independence. This was something that was really unthinkable, the idea that you would be able to declare independence. Right. It's kind of like if we decided that San Diego was going to declare independence from California, right? I mean, who would even think that was a good idea, you know what I'm saying? And that's the way people thought of it. You just can't do that. Right. But what happens is that there's a pamphleteer. He was kind of a misfit, I guess you could say. His name was Thomas Payne. He'd had a lot of trouble in England, and he finally emigrated to America with letters from Benjamin Franklin, who was in England at the time, and he came to America. So he's very anti monarchy, right. And he's going to write a little pamphlet called common sense. And what the pamphlet says is that Americans need to look past what they think of as common sense now, because common sense at that time was that they would continue to have a monarchy. Right. And he said that if we look at all these things that we're being oppressed by and we look at all the resources that we have, there's no reason why we should be ruled by Britain. And this is going to become a very popular pamphlet because it really states what many people have already started thinking, that being part of the empire really isn't that great of an idea and that we should be. So what we see then is this shift in public opinion towards independence. And because of that, the Congress will actually write and publish a declaration of independence. Right. So that's going to be how the Declaration of Independence actually happened. Okay. Well, the next thing is that there's going to be essentially eight years of war, which is seven years. Seven or eight years of war, which is going to be mostly bad news for the Americans. The Americans barely survive, but in the end, they will win. Okay? They will win independence. And this is why, basically, these three big reasons. And again, obviously, this is really oversimplification, but the three big reasons are that, first off, George Washington didn't lose. Okay? What that means is that George Washington was not a sort of. He was not a conventional general. Right. Because a conventional general. The way that it worked was the way that war was supposed to work at that time was that they would have a battle and whoever lost the battle would surrender. Okay. But Washington would have a battle and he would lose the battle. But he didn't surrender. Instead he left. He ran away. Right. Okay. And then he would come back and fight again another day. So that broke the rules. But it also meant that Americans didn't lose the. Okay. And even later, when the British were able to take Philadelphia, which is the american capital at the time, the idea was that if you take the unemployment's capital, then you win. Right. That was capture the flag. Right. But when the american government just left. So the British didn't win. They couldn't win because the Americans wouldn't give up. Okay, so that's the first part. The second part is the french alliance. The Americans sought an alliance with France and were eventually successful in gaining that alliance. Not on the part of the French because the French were in favor of America's ideas of liberty and that sort of thing. But if you'll recall, the French were still very upset from the loss in the french and indian war. So what happens then is when France allies with the Americans, then all of a sudden, for Britain, it's no longer just a colonial war. Now they have to fight the war all over the world because the French and the British are going to be fighting in Europe and in America and in the Caribbean and in Asia and South America. Right. And in fact, the last battle of the american revolution was fought in India. Okay, so then what happens is that this little skirmish that was happening in this little disturbance that was happening among the colonists in America is now a global war which is costing the British a lot of money. Right, and blood. Okay. And then finally, with the loss at Yorktown, the British had already lost one army at Saratoga and that had actually caused the french alliance to come into play. They lost another army under Cornwallis at Yorktown. And that will bring down the government and the public will demand, essentially that the British come make peace with the Americans. Right? So the British then decide to negotiate with the Americans. This happened in 1786, I think. But they argued in Paris over the treaty for a couple of years. Okay, so at any rate, the British then make peace with the Americans based on the fact that the british public would no longer support the war. Okay, now you may be wondering, what is this painting? What happened at the time was whenever there was a major treaty that all the people who were involved in the treaty would come together for a portrait. Okay? But the British were so upset, they were so embarrassed at having lost the war to these american colonials that they didn't show up for the portrait. So the only people that ended up in the portrait were the Americans. Okay? This is a real portrait. It's actually hanging in John Adams'house in Massachusetts now, all right? And that's how the Americans won the war. Now, let me just ask you this question. Just knowing what you know about history, can you think of any other example of when a tiny country that was militarily deficient was able to defeat a mighty country because the people of the mighty country just gave up on the war, would no longer support it? Can you think of an example like that? Vietnam. Exactly. That's exactly what happened in so, all right, so the Vietnamese learned from american history, even if Americans didn't. Okay."
58,"US1: 431 -US2: 431
","Okay, well, we're going to move out of the earlier part of the nation's history, what they call the early republic. And we're moving now into kind of an expansionist era between essentially between the end of the end of the war of 1812 and the civil war. And we're going to start off by talking about, how about a major change in american democracy, because as you guys will recall, when the country was first founded, most people were left out. The people who actually could vote were only property owning males. And we talked about why that was, because the idea, in theory, was that only property owning males first had anything to protect, and secondly, they were the only ones who would be able to rule wisely in favor of the country. What we're going to see is that as the nation grows geographically, it's also going to become more democratic. And let me just show you how that happens. All right, so are any questions before I get started? You guys are with me. Okay, so now, in 1787, which you guys will know is before the constitution. Are you guys seeing the screen? Yeah. You want to share? Screen on here. Sorry about that, guys. Now can you see it? Yes. Okay. All right. So in 1787, which was before the constitution, the Congress passed a law called the Northwest ordinance that was actually written by Thomas Jefferson. And what the Northwest ordinance did was it established a means for adding new territory to the United States. All right? And they called it the Northwest Territory because this was the northwestern part of the United States at that time. And what the ordinance said was that in order to add new states and keep in mind that states are not provinces, states are actually countries. This is the way people think about them at the time. Right? So in order to add new countries to this union of countries, the United States, the way that that would happen would be that the Congress would create a territory, and then people would move into the territory. And then once people were in, once there were enough people in the territory, they would hold a convention, elect a government, and apply for admission to the union. We already talked about this, I think, Monday, about how they had to apply as either slave or free. Interestingly, about the Northwest ordinance, which was written by Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, was that slavery was prohibited in the Northwest Territory. But at any rate, the point here is that the state would apply for admission, and then the Congress would say, yes or no, you're in or you're not in, which is going to be really important for us when we start next week on the discussion that we're going to have on Monday. But at any rate, the point here is that once the Congress had said yes, then the state is in. Okay? So there's going to be a couple of reasons why people would. People who moved into the. Into the new territory would be interested in encouraging other people to come. And one would be because of the idea of land speculation, as we've said, that the major kind of industry in the west at this time is selling land. And so you have to have somebody to sell land to in order to be able to sell it. So there would be a, you know, sentiment of wanting to get more people to come into the territory. And then also it had political ramifications as well, because if you were one of the first people in these new territories, then you would be more likely to be elected, you know, governor and representative and senator and things like that. So these new territories that were created did things to try to encourage people to move their. From the east, okay? And keep in mind that most of the population of the United States is in this area now, okay? And so the result of that was that one of the ways that they did that was by lowering the qualifications to vote from being a property owner to some other. Other. Either you had. Had contributed to the community somehow by, you know, serving the militia or something like that, or even in some cases, just by being a white male, you would be extended the vote. Right. And the reason for that is because Americans liked the idea of voting. And so the idea was that they would come to. People would say, well, if I moved, I'm in Massachusetts now, and I can't vote in Massachusetts, but if I move to Ohio, I'll be able to vote, and that's a big deal to me. Right. And so Americans are actually encouraged to move into these areas, and eventually they all become states by the. By the process defined in the northwest ordinance. The significance, though, is that as people are encouraged to move further west, the states in the east are going to become more alarmed, because if they're losing population, what else are they losing in terms of government? Votes in power? Representation in the house. Exactly. They're losing representation. And so they're going to then follow suit in lowering the qualifications for voting until by the 1820s, we have in the United States something called universal manhood suffrage. Okay? Now, keep in mind that the word here is not suffering. Right? Everybody's suffering. Everybody can suffer, but not everybody can vote. So suffrage is voting, okay? And just also keep in mind that the word franchise also means the right to vote. Okay? Keep that in mind. You guys are all with me. Questions? Comments? So by the 1820s. The United States is much more democratic than it was in the beginning, and at the same time, there are literally hundreds of thousands of new voters."

","Okay. The last one has to do really with economics, right? And I want to spend a little bit of time here talking about economics. And the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to work on a diagram. Okay? So what we're going to do is we're going to push this x, right? And this diagram. Actually, I don't know what all this is. What is that? Okay. Oh, crap. Sorry about that. Okay, so now here what happens with. There's this theory. The theory is called dependency theory. Okay, let me just put that up here. And the reason why. We'll talk about it in a minute. Why it's called dependency theory, okay? But what it does is it explains the relationship between the governed, or I should say, really the colonizers and the colonized, all right? And what the theory is, is that you divide the world up into two groups of countries. And the two groups of countries, we're going to call them the metropolis and the periphery. Okay? So the metropolis is all the industrialized countries. Metropolis is the modernized countries. That'd be like Britain, United States, France, Belgium. Those. The periphery is going to be the countries that are. Okay, like Cuba, for example, or Puerto Rico or the philippine islands or other countries. We'll talk more about that in just a second. Right? Okay, but the relationship between them is that the metropolis. I'll say it the other way around. Let's take this one here. And how do we do this? There we go. We'll make this go over here. Right? Okay. So the periphery provides resources to the economy, the industrialized economy of the metropolis, right? So for example, the British in India. The british extract cotton from India to be used in the cotton mills in England, right? And then the metropolis also. Oh, crap. That's not what I wanted to do. Sorry about that, guys. The metropolis also uses the periphery for markets, right? So the periphery sends goods to the metropolis and those goods are manufactured, are converted into manufactured goods. And those manufactured goods are sold sometimes back to the periphery. So in the case of Britain, the Indians grow cotton and sell it to the British. British turn that cotton into textiles and sell those textiles back in India, right? And that's essentially the structure of imperialism for most of the european countries. Okay, questions? Comments about this. Okay. The problem here, or I should say the situation here, ends up being that the reason why it's called dependency theory is because the economy of the metropolis is not dependent. It is to a certain extent, but not totally on the economy of the periphery. Because the metropolis can make all kinds of different goods. It has a diversified economy. So if, for example, the market goes out for cotton textiles and they can make railroads or they can make cars or something like that. In fact, what happened, one of the places where we could see this was in Brazil. Brazil had an economy that was based on the export of coffee, right? But during World War I, nobody could afford coffee. So the economy of Brazil tanked, right? Because nobody was buying their stuff. Because in the periphery, the peripheral countries only have one thing to sell, right? That's why they call it monostaple, right? So in the metropolis we have diversified economies, but in the periphery, we have monostapele economies, right? So that means then, like I said, let's say we're in, right? Or let's say we're in Cuba, right? Let's say we're in Cuba and our export is sugar, right? But if the market for sugar drop falls away, then our whole economy will collapse, right? Whereas the metropolitan economy can still survive because they manufacture things that don't necessarily depend on sugar. Okay, does that make sense to you guys? Questions, comments? About that. So it's dependency theory because the colonies are dependent on the metropolis for their economic well being. Okay, you guys got that? Questions, comments? Okay, now let's think about, well, how does the metropolis maintain control over the colonized economy? If we were looking at something like Britain and India, we would say, okay, well, the British actually, this is not what I want. This crap never works for me. Okay, well, the british directly rule. Let me just put that here. You could pretend that it's there. I have to fix this later, right, but the British directly rule India, right? Direct rule, meaning that parliament actually rules over. Know, India is called the jewel of the british crown and that's how they maintain control in India. They actually legislate for India. They control all aspects of indian society. But let's say, for example, the United States. The United States doesn't acquire overseas empires that they directly rule, right? For example, we're going to notice that during this period of time the United States will have heavy influence on latin american countries. Like in Central America, they call them the banana republics, right? Because that's where they export tropical fruits from. Nicaragua, Honduras, places like, right? And the United States doesn't rule those countries, but the United States controls the economy, right? And that is going to be called economic imperialism, right? Economic imperialism. And what that means is. Let me just write this down for you, right? Imperialism, okay, so what that means is that the peripheral. The country is nominally independent, but its economy is controlled by the metropolis, okay, metropolis and imperial control is accomplished by military intervention. Okay, so let me show you how this works. All right. So, after the spanish american war, the United States actually eventually decided to annex Puerto Rico and the philippine islands. Okay? But the United States couldn't annex Cuba because they had said that they wouldn't. Right? And so instead, what happened was they passed a law called the Platt Amendment. And what the Platt amendment said was that Cuba was independent, but that the United States could intervene if the government of Cuba acted in a way that was irresponsible. Okay, so the way Cuba becomes independent is that the United States frees it from the Spanish, but they also write a constitution for them. An american admiral actually writes the cuban constitution. And why do you think that is? Why do you think the Cubans couldn't write their own constitution? They probably didn't know. Mean, there were people in Cuba, revolutionaries, that were very well educated. It's not like they couldn't figure it, like, because they were being ruled and stuff. You know what I mean? So they had a dictator for so long that they probably didn't know what rights to give or what rules to have and stuff like that. Just like, generally speaking, not like literally every single one. Okay, I understand what you're saying, but really, that's kind of a demonstration of the thinking of the Americans, because what the Americans thought was that they really aren't capable of ruling themselves. So we have to do it for them. And that's this paternalistic attitude, right? That we know how to do it. We're going to show you how to do it, because you haven't been able to figure out how to do it. Your right. Okay, so. So, at any rate, the United Constitution puts in place their government at the same time passes this law called the Platt Amendment. And what the Platt amendment says is that if you act in a way that's irresponsible, if Cuba. If the cuban government acts in a way that's irresponsible, the United States can intervene militarily, can send troops, right? And that's what happens. So the United States will then intervene in many spanish american countries for the next two or three decades. Essentially, whenever american economic interests were threatened, the United States would send in troops to make sure that american economic interests were secure. Okay, you guys, follow me here. So, that's economic imperialism. We don't really rule Cuba, but we get all the benefit of their economy. The benefit of economic imperialism is that the metropolis is no longer responsible for the well being of the peripheral directly. If England directly ruled India, they were responsible for the defense of India. They were responsible for education, public health, for administration, railroads, infrastructure, all those different things. Right? But if the United States just controls the economy of Cuba and all the rest of that stuff can be left to the Cubans how they want to do it, right. So the United States doesn't have to spend that kind of money and effort to do that. You follow what I'm saying? So that's the advantage of economic imperialism. And american imperialism is going to be almost all economic imperialism, okay? And it's not just american imperialism that is economic. Other countries, Britain and France and Germany, also accomplish it in different places. Right? But it's going to be the standard, essentially, for american imperialism."

","Okay. Well, let's talk a little bit about Andrew Jackson's presidency. Okay. And his big issue. Andrew Jackson's big political issue is that he is opposed to the bank. He's opposed to the national bank. Now keep in mind that Andrew Jackson is from Tennessee. Let's see if we can think about what we learned on Monday and discover why Andrew Jackson would be against the national bank. First off, we want to wonder, is Tennessee north south or west? South. We would think of it as south today, but it was west then, right. It was in the west. All right, so Andrew Jackson comes from the west and he's opposed to the national bank. I wonder why. Why would that be? Because it was negative for the west. Why? Why was it negative for the west? Because they needed the. The credit to buy real estate. Real estate and land and stuff. And National bank would kind of make that a bit harder for them. Right. National bank made it harder for them to get credit. Okay. Exactly. All right. So. So he's very much against the national bank, but when it comes to tariffs, because he's from the west, he doesn't care about the national tariffs. Right. And so Congress is going to start to enact new and more restrictive tariffs during the 1820s and 1830s. And does anybody remember what was the purpose of tariffs? We talked about protective tariffs to tax imports and exports. What was the reason for it? We were calling protective. Oh, to protect, like, american. The american economy and stuff. Exactly. Encourage, like, the making of goods in America. Exactly. So it supports american industry. But who does it hurt? Sorry? Who does. Who do protective tariffs hurt? I like self sustaining economies like the south who relied on exporting like cotton. Okay, so then what happens is that Jackson. This is not Jackson. Jackson doesn't really care about the tariffs. And so they go ahead and they go through. But the south is incensed. The south is dead set opposed to these tariffs. And eventually what happens with the passing of a new tariff called the southerners call the tariff of abominations. There's a sense among many people, particularly in the south, that the state government actually takes precedence over the national government. Okay. And this is an argument that's been in place since the very beginning, because the constitution can be interpreted to not say which government is actually supreme. The constitution has a supremacy clause, but the understanding of the constitution is that it limits the powers of the federal government to what the constitution provides. And so it can be supreme in every place where it has jurisdiction, but still have the state governments be supreme in everything else. You guys follow? I'm saying here. And so many of the states who are feeling the negative consequences of these new tariffs are going to start talking about, well, we shouldn't even have to follow them. We can nullify them. Right? So the idea here is that they believe that it. That they can. That if the federal government tries to impose a law that goes against the interests of the state, the state can nullify that law. Okay. And again, this goes all the way back. Thomas Jefferson actually was in favor of the idea of nullification. Okay, so at any rate, so in 1832, after they enact this new tariff, the state of South Carolina is going to enact an ordinance of nullification. The ordinance of nullification essentially says that the tariffs are nullified, they're not going to enact, they're not going to enforce the tariff, and that they threatened to secede from the union. Okay, so now the one thing I want you guys to understand now is that, is that South Carolina is as far south as you can go before the civil war. What do I mean by that? If I say South Carolina is as far south as you go, as you can go, what am I saying? Is that true? Geographically? No. But as far as the state's rights are concerned, that nothing passes. That South Carolina, essentially that South Carolina becomes the symbol of states rights and white supremacy. Right. South Carolina becomes the symbol states rights and white supremacy. Okay, so now South Carolina says we're not going to collect the tariff. Jackson, who, as I already mentioned, didn't really care about the tariff, but does care about the union, threatens to intervene in South Carolina militarily. And the result of it is that there is a compromise. A bunch of people come together, Jackson, this handsome fellow here, John Calhoun, and congressional leaders come together and they negotiate a reduction in the tariffs. And so then the South Carolina repeals the nullification act. Right. Nullification ordinance. Okay, you guys are with me. So now the outcome of it is that the South Carolina doesn't succeed and the tariffs are reduced. Okay, who wins? The south. Well, didn't the tariffs get reduced? Tariffs got reduced. Is that what they really want? What do they really want? They didn't want to pay the tariff at all. They don't want any tariffs. Right. So did they get what they wanted? Yeah. What about. What about the national government in this case, represented by Jackson? Did he get what he wanted? Yes. What did he want? For South Carolina to stay. To stay and pay a little bit of the tariff and pay all the tariff. Right. So did they get what they wanted? The push? Did. Did the north get everything they wanted? Did the congress, the national government get everything they wanted? What did they want? We just said it. They wanted South Carolina to stay in the union and wanted them to pay all of the tariffs, right. Or collect all the tariffs. And did they get that? Yes. No, they didn't. Because remember, the tariffs were reduced, right? So they didn't get everything they wanted. They got some of what they wanted, but they didn't get everything they wanted. Right? You guys get what I'm saying here? And the south, did they get everything they wanted? Remember, they wanted no tariffs at all, right? Did they get everything they wanted? No, they didn't get everything they wanted. That's what compromise means. You don't get everything, but you get something. You see what I'm saying? And it keeps the union together. But now I want you to think, I know you guys are having a hard time getting the old brain fired up this morning, but I, but I want you to think about this and I'm not going to answer it for you. And that is, what question is left unanswered in terms of the relationship between the national government and the state government? Who has more power? Exactly. Which government is supreme? So essentially the essential question here really wasn't the tariff. The essential question was which government is supreme? Is it the national government or is it the state government? And they made a compromise, but the compromise didn't settle that question, which means that that question will come up again later. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. I've made you suffer enough. Go away. Live long and prosper."

","One last thing and then we're done. Okay? Remember we talked about the red scare that happened after World War one. The same thing happens after World War two. The Soviets are vocally aggressive. Basically, Khrushchev said, as it mentioned in the song at the beginning of the lecture, that he would bury us. Now, he didn't mean that he was going to do it with a shovel. He meant that they were going to do it economically, but that didn't happen. At any rate, Americans were very concerned about communism. And so basically, if you wanted to be a politician in the 1950s and the 1960s, you had to be a very staunch anti communist. Right. And Americans were afraid of communism, even though most Americans didn't even know what it was. Okay. At any rate, what will happen is that there's going to be a. There's going to be one politician. His name is Joseph McCarthy. He's a senator from Wisconsin. And he's going to muster, he's going to essentially weaponize this, this kind of, in many ways, unreasonable fear of communism. Okay? Now we can say this. The first thing we can say is, was there a threat? Yes, there was a threat. The Soviets said that if they could, they would destroy the United States. Right. The problem is that Americans were never going to fall for communism. Why? Americans don't like communism because they like property. Like, yeah, we don't want to give up our stuff. Exactly. All right, so, so they're. The idea that this, that we were going to be sneaked in, sneaked into or duped into communism is really ridiculous. Okay? But it was enough to keep people in fear. It was enough to keep people's attention. It was enough to mobilize people. Okay? And the way that this guy Truman did. Excuse me, McCarthy. The way that McCarthy did that was he said. He basically said that he had the list of 100 names of people working in the state Department who were actually soviet spies. Okay? Now, he never produced this list. Okay? Nobody ever knew who was on the list, but it gave him a lot of attention. Right? And he started. He started basically holding hearings against different people who were accused of being communist. And what happened then was that it kind of elevated into a situation where all you had to do was be accused of being a communist, and that was the end of your career. That's one of the reasons why many people, particularly in american government, actually accused Martin Luther King of being a communist. Right. Martin Luther King was nowhere near being a communist. He was never going to be a communist. Right. Because he was a christian. But nevertheless, if you can label him a communist, and that makes him an enemy. You guys get what I'm saying? And it was because of this kind of atmosphere of fear that was created by McCarthy, who was using it really for his own political well being, his own political influence. All right. Okay. So. So what ends up happening is that McCarthy makes a big mistake and he takes on the army. And. And I'm going to show you a couple of clips here. But one of the first clip I'm going to show you is going to be when finally people realized that McCarthy had overstepped the bounds of democracy. Here's the thing. The problem with what McCarthy was doing was that he was using the same tactics as the people that he opposed. Right? And one of the things that I think that this other guy we're going to see here in a minute says you can't defend democracy abroad by preventing it at home or by destroying it at home, right? And that's what he was doing. Okay? He was basically running a campaign of innuendo that was destroying people's lives. Right? So let me just show you this one clip here. At one of the hearings, mister chairman, may I say that Mister Wells talks about this being cruel and reckless. He was just baiting. He has been baiting Mister Cohen here for hours, requesting that Mister Cohen, before sundown, get out of any department of the government, anyone who is serving the communist cause. Now, I just give this man's record. And I want to say, mister Welch, that it has been labeled long before he became a member. As early as 1944, we know he belonged to the lawyer's guild. And Mister Cohen nods his. I. Did you, I think, no personal injury, Mister Cole. No, sir. I meant to do you no personal injury. No. And if I did, I beg your pardon. Let us not assassinate this lad further, senator. You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency? I know this hurts you, Mister Welch. I'll say it. May I say, mister chairman, as the point of personal prohibition? I'd like to finish this, senator. Isaac. It hurts you too, sir. I'd like to finish this. I know Mister Cohen would rather not have me go into this. I intend to. However. And mister. Mister Welch talks about any sense of decency, it seems that Mister Welch is pained so deeply he thinks it's improper for me to give the record, the communist front record, of the man whom he wanted to foist upon this committee. But it doesn't pain him at all. There's no pain in his chest. About the attempt to destroy the reputation and the take the jobs away from the young men who are working on my committee. And Mister Welch, if I have said anything here which is untrue, then tell me. I have heard you and everyone else talk so much about laying the truth upon the table that when I heard completely phony. Mister Welch, I have listened enough for a long time to say, now, before sundown, you must get these people out of government. So that I just want to have it very clear, very clear that you were not so serious about that when you tried to recommend this man for this committee. But the point is, the chair would like to say again that the democratic police want to. Welch recommended Mister Fisher as counsel for this committee because he has through his office all the recommendations Richard made and does not recall any of them coming for Mister Welch. And that would include Mister Fisher. Well, let me ask Mister Welch. You brought him down, did you not? To act as your assistant? Mister McCarthy, I will not discuss this further with you. You have sat within 6ft of me and could have asked me about Fred Fisher. You have seen fit to bring it out. And if there is a God in heaven, it will do neither you nor your cause any good. I will not discuss it further. I will not ask Mister Cohen any more witnesses. You, mister chairman, may of do will call the next witness. Senator Jeff, you guys saw the video clip, right? Okay, so you heard the video clip, right? That was the. It's a very famous, although you might not have heard of it, it's a very famous event where McCarthy. McCarthy was actually called out. And then after that he eventually was. Ended. Ended up being censured by, by the Congress. Okay, but let me just. Somehow or other, I got this all screwed up. The guy that you saw at the end, the younger looking guy, his name was Roy Cohn. He was actually Donald Trump's lawyer. Okay? He was Donald Trump's lawyer in New York and his mentor. Right? And we're going to be, you guys probably, if you looked at the syllabus, you know that on Monday, we're going to be discussing chapters five and six of the. Of the Meacham book that I gave you guys, right? And one of those chapters is about McCarthy. And I think that you'll find that the. I think that you may find some very interesting parallels between the career of Joseph McCarthy and the career of later politicians. All right? So anyway, that's something that, for you to look forward to. Questions, comments about any of that. I want to show this other thing. This is one of the things that ended up having a major effect on public opinion. And it was by a journalist named Edward R. Murrow. He was. He was really the kind of Walter Cronkite before Walter Cronkite, okay? And he had a show and he had a kind of a conflict with McCarthy and this is how he ended up basically denouncing McCarthy. So let me just go ahead and show this. Earlier the senator asked, upon what meat does this our Caesar feed? Had he looked three lines earlier in Shakespeare's Caesar he would have found this line, which is not altogether inappropriate. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves. No one familiar with the history of his country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating. But the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one and the junior senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind as between the internal and the external threats of communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and our doctrines and remember that we are not descended from fearful men not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were for the moment, unpopular. This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities as a nation. We have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves as indeed we are the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world. But we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the junior senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear. He merely exploited it and rather successfully. Cassius was right. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves. Good night and good luck. So one of the things that. One of the reasons why I think it's important for us to study history is because sometimes the words that were spoken a long time ago or in another time actually are appropriate for us. What do you guys think? I think that, you know, we, we definitely are based, like, history goes in circles, and we're basically going through the same thing, but with a different culture. And basically, they'll say anything's communism and people would reject it. And that's kind of like, it exploded more with the media that we are in. So first to learn from the past, they're reusing the same tropes again on us, and we should, like, realize, and that's how we, like, overcome the same thing, but it's actually happening over again. Yeah, we've, we, it's, it's kind of like, um, if, if we, let's say we put our hand on the stove and we get burned and it hurts really bad, and then we take our hand off the stove and we just, we just forget about it. And next time we're faced with the stove, what are we going to know better? Anybody else? I think that it was nice that at that time, there was somebody that enough people admired that they listened to his opinion. I'm not sure we have that now. I'm not sure we have, like, a voice that, you know, most people would listen to. You know, the thing about it is, you know, that when he said what he said, you can be sure that there were a number of other people who said, oh, he's full of it. It would be like, you know, Fox News and MSNBC. Right. So that part of it's really not different. Okay. It's just that his side seemed to be the more reasonable. And I think that that's really the, the theme of that book that we're reading is that when Americans are faced with this danger, we tend to somehow find the better angels. And I think that this is an example of that."
62,"US1: 424 -US2: 424
","One last thing we're going to talk about, and it has to do with Spanish America. And this is going to be important for us in a couple of different ways. One, by essentially cementing american foreign policy for the 19th century, but the other part of it is also going to set us up for the acquisition of all the western territories, right? So let me just start off by saying, let me see. Here's a map of Spanish America, right? And this is the map here. You see, this map shows the green part here, which was the spanish empire in America. And it's got dates in each of the different countries. And I know it's hard for you to see these dates, but, like Mexico's, 1821, Central America, 1822. Venezuela, 1814. You guys are all following me here, right? So these are the dates that these countries become independent from the spanish empire. All right? Now, the reason why. Well, let's just say the reason why they became independent was because Spain was conquered by Napoleon during the. During the napoleonic wars in Europe, same as the war of 1812 in the United States, right? But what happens is that there are basically two different groups in Spanish America who think about what's going. What kind of countries are these new countries going to be? Right. And the two groups we're just going to right now call them liberals and conservatives, okay? And the liberals are people who believe that these spanish american countries should be ruled like the United States. So they look at the United States as a model for establishing popular government. Okay? The other group is going to be the conservatives. The conservatives are the ones who actually benefited from the spanish empire. And the result of it will be that they will. So what I'm looking for, that they. They will try to keep the structure of the spanish empire in place. Okay, I want you guys to just keep that in mind, okay, as we go through this course, right? But the main thing, the difference would be the difference, essentially, between a republic like the United states, or a monarchy, like Spain. All right, you guys follow me here. And the liberals would want a republic, and the conservatives would want a monarchy. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, well, now, all of the different countries or former colonies in Spanish America had achieved independence by 1824, right? And what that means from the point of view of the Americans is that, well, let me just say it this way before I get there. And that is to say that there was a lot of political turmoil and unrest in Spanish America, and it was this contest between the liberals and the conservatives. And the Americans obviously preferred the liberals for a couple of reasons. One being because it validated the american revolution. It validated the principles of the american revolution. But the other reason had to do with trade, because liberals believed in free trade. And so what happened then? If a liberal country, if a liberal government ruled in a spanish american country that was a trading partner for the United States, you guys get what I'm saying? So american interest in Spanish America is going to be twofold. On the one hand, it's ideological, because Americans believe in the kind of spread of the american revolution toward liberalism. Liberalism. Remember, we called it democracy, secularism, capitalism. So on the one hand, it's idealistic, and on the other hand, it's economic, because if these countries are liberal countries, then they're also free traders. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? So american foreign policy, then, is going to be driven by, just like american domestic policy is going to be driven by two different motivators, idealism and economics. All right, questions? Comments? About any of that? Okay, now what happens? Just, I want to, in fact, let me skip this. I'll do that later. Okay. So what happens is that as the spanish empire recedes, as these different colonies break away from the spanish empire, they fall into political instability and turmoil. And what that does is it makes them weak and it makes them kind of targets of other colonizing countries like Britain and France. Right? The idea then, is that the weakness of these spanish american countries, the political instability in these spanish american countries, makes them targets essentially of colonialism. And the Americans are concerned about the establishment of new colonies in the Americas because they see this, again, as, first of all, the opportunity to expand America's liberal influence, but also to expand America's economic influence. And so if the colonizing powers of Europe introduced new colonies, like, for example, the French tried to, to recolonize Mexico, right? And the British tried to recolonize other places. Right? If that happens, then that is going to be detrimental to american policy. You guys follow what I'm saying here? And so the Americans then are going to come up with a doctrine. We're going to call it the Monroe doctrine, right? And the, what the Monroe doctrine essentially says is this, the United States will view the establishment of any new colonies in the Americas as, quote, the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. And then, so basically what they're saying is, what do you think they're saying? What is the United States telling Europe? We don't want your interference. Right. Or what? Or else. Or nothing, really. Because the American, we have to remember that the United States was incredibly weak at this time. Right? And so when they, when they make this statement, they're, they're basically, it's like a three year old in the sandbox shaking their fist at the adults and saying, this is my sandbox. Stay out. Right. And what are the American. What are the adults going to do in response to that? What do you guys think? I'm sorry? Spank them. Well, do you think they're going to take them seriously? No. No. Do you think that the Europeans take this very seriously? No. No, they don't. Okay. But. And that's because the United States was weak at the time. But the United States is going to become more powerful. Right. At the end of the civil war, the United States had the largest land army on earth. And at the end of the civil war, or actually during the civil war, France tried to reestablish a colony over Mexico through what they call an empire, the empire of Maximilian. Right. And at the end of the civil war, the. The american army was placed on the Rio Grande, and an american ambassador went to France and asked, when are you leaving? When are you leaving Mexico? And they left Mexico right after that. Right? So the Americans, when they have the power to enforce their doctrine, will enforce it. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this? All right. Okay. So that's the Monroe doctrine. You're not going to hear more about that in this course, but you will hear about it in us history, too. Okay. All right. So then let me just go a little bit further and talk about in 1823, the United States was weak, and it didn't, it didn't really have the power to enforce its doctrine. But by 1894. I know it's a little bit out of our era, but there was an example of how american foreign policy became more aggressive over time, and that was what's known as the Venezuela boundary dispute. Okay? And what happens here is that there was. Venezuela was an independent country, had been for a long time, but Guyana was actually a british colony, okay? British Guiana, okay? And the. The border between Venezuela and British Guiana was pretty much undefined. And the reason why was because there was really nothing of any value in this area, so they thought. But what ended up happening was that somebody discovered gold. And then all of a sudden, Venezuela said, oh, that's our. That's our territory. And the British said, no, no, it's our territory. And the British threatened to go to war against Venezuela over this territory. Right. You guys are with me. So what Venezuela does is it appeals to the United States government to enforce the Monroe doctrine against the British. And what will happen is that the secretary of state, Richard Olney, is going to incorporate what's known as the Olney corollary to the Monroe doctrine. And what that says is the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition. Okay, so what do you think it means to be practically sovereign, like their own leadership, like no one else can lead in that area. Exactly. In practice, we are sovereign, even though we don't directly rule Venezuela, but we're practically sovereign. Right. Meaning we're in practice, we're sovereign over this entire area. And it says it's fiat is law. What is a fiat little italian car. Right, but that's not what they're talking about here. Have you guys ever heard the motto, the University of California? Fiat lux. Fiat lux. Which means let there be light. Right? It's from the bible, right? God said, let there be light. Fiat lux. But what that means then, is that a fiat is what I say it, and it happens. It's a godlike power, right? So what we see here is United States claiming godlike power over the Americas, right? In 1894. And how do you think the British respond? The British back down. Now, the British didn't back down because they were afraid of the Americans. They backed down because they had interests elsewhere, and he didn't want to get into a war with the United States in the Americas. So they essentially tacitly acknowledged American are us influence over the Americas. So the Americas become the United States sphere of influence. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? And that's going to remain really, even to some extent, up to today. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right, last thing, then I want to just briefly talk about this. This is going all the way back to even before the. The mexican revolution, right. Or between. Before Mexico became independent. And that was when the United States acquired Louisiana. The eastern boundary was well documented, but the western boundary was kind of wide open. Right. Because they just knew it's out there somewhere. Okay. And then as Americans moved further and further into the western, the Spanish became more and more concerned that Americans might take this territory from them. And so what they did was they negotiated a treaty with the United States to establish the boundary between the United States and the spanish empire. All right? Or the boundary between the United States and Mexico, because Mexico will later acknowledge this treaty, right? And so what happens is that the treaty is called the treaty of Adams Onis, because Adams was the american secretary of state and Onis was the spanish foreign minister. Right? And they established the American. The line between the United States and. And Mexico, where we see this big red line here, right? So it's actually the Sabine river, the Red river, and then some other geographical locations. And the end of it then is that it really gives us a defined boundary between the United States and the spanish empire. You guys roll with me. Questions, comments about this. The other part that comes into the Treaty of Adams Onis is that Florida had been ruled by the spanish empire, but they were incapable of controlling the native population there. And so the United States had been sending troops into Florida to defeat the natives. And so one of the outcomes of this treaty was that Florida was granted to the United States. United States got Florida and they defined this boundary. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Now the last thing that I want to mention about this is that when the United States went into the negotiations over the Adams Onis treaty, they claimed that the border of the United States with, or actually the border of the Louisiana purchase was on the Rio Bravo, or we call it the Rio Grande. Right? So the Americans claimed that this territory, everything north of this territory was american, right? But when they did that, actually nobody believed that that was where the Louisiana purchase. Where the boundary of the Louisiana purchase was. Okay? It was an opening bid. It's kind of like if you want to sell your motorcycle, you'll advertise it for 10,000 and take 7000, right? And that's what the Americans did. They had advertised for 10,000, but they settled for 7000. You guys follow I'm saying here? And so this territory ends up being essentially ceded by the United States, even though the United States really never believed that they owned it. You follow what I'm saying here? Okay. So then the one thing that we want to keep in mind is that in this treaty negotiation, the United States had at one point claimed the border of Texas to be the real. Bravo. Okay. And we want to keep that in mind for another lecture that we're going to have coming up relatively soon. Okay? Questions, comments about this?"

","So I want to spend a little bit of time now talking about some definitions, and that's kind of the thing that we've been aiming at today, and some of these I've already talked about. So, historiography, the study of historical writing, or how do we. History of how we tell the story over time, which I. Which we saw today. We saw Frederick Jackson Turner tell the story one way, and we saw Patricia Lemmy tell it a different way. Okay. Ontology, an implicit organization of the world and its inhabitants. What does that mean? It's implied. Everybody knows it, but it's not stated. It doesn't have to be stated. Okay. Everybody just knows that. And that's something we'll have to actually wrestle with more as we go through the course because it really only makes sense to understand what people are doing if we understand their point of view. Okay, then here's a couple of terms that you're probably not familiar with, and these aren't really kind of common terms, but they're terms I found in a book that I like a lot, and it describes the challenge for historians, because we'll say, okay, there's historicity one and historicity two. Historicity one is what happened, and historicity two is what is said to have happened. Right. Obviously, they're not the same thing. What happened is what happened. But what is said to have happened is influenced by, for example, just not long ago, there was a Super bowl, and the Super bowl was between Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Kansas City Chiefs. And the Buccaneers won the Super bowl, and the score was 31 to nine. I think something like that. I don't really watch football, but I know this happened. Okay? Now, if I'm a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan and you ask me about that game, I would say, well, that was a great game. I love that game because our guy, Tom Brady won another ring, and Tampa Bay has now won the Super bowl. And it's just a very positive experience for me. But if you ask somebody who's a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs, they'll say, that was a horrible game. I mean, it was awful. It just was. Can't. It's almost hard to take. I almost want to cry or something like that. Right? And you can see what we've just done is that we've taken the same historicity one and we've created two very different narratives. Right. And what drives that narrative? What drives the narrative is our own ontological point of view. Am I a Chiefs fan or am I a Buccaneers fan? You follow what I'm saying? So this is something we have to think about whenever we're considering what happened in the past, because we're going to look know secondary sources. I'll tell you what that is in a right. People who have interpreted what happened, like Frederick Jackson Turner interpreted what happened, or Patricia Limerick interpreted what happened, and they interpret it from their own ontological point of view. And on top of that, we have our own ontological point of view. So we might now think that Frederick Jackson Turner is full of beans and that Patricia Limerick is closer to the mark. That's our own ontological point of view, and we have to be able to recognize that as well. Okay, so that's historicity one, historicity two. The challenge of how you weigh what happened against what is said to have happened. All right? And then finally, sources that historians use, generally texts, but can also be photographs and media, things like that. Right? But a primary source is an uninterpreted document, and a secondary source is an interpretation of a primary source. So in this case, we could say that primary source is declaration of Independence. The secondary source is my book, telling you what the Declaration of Independence means. So the primary source is not interpreted, it just is what it is, and the secondary source is an interpretation of that document. We could also look, for example, at the two works we looked at today, Turner's thesis, which we could now, because it's well over 100 years old, consider to be a primary source, and Patricia Limerick, who is interpreting that document. Okay, so we could say, okay, the Turner thesis is a primary source, and the Limerick Book is an interpretation of that source. So Turner's thesis is a primary source, and Patricia Limerick's thesis, or Patricia Limerick's book is a secondary source in interpretation of Turner's primary source. And so that's the lecture, I guess you could say, for today. This is Professor Cox signing off. Live long and prosper."

","So let's go in and move into what we were going to talk about today, and that is the so called era of good feelings. What was the last thing we talked about? Was it Andrew Jackson? Jackson going against the british army and winning? Okay. All right. And what was that event called? It was the war of something. 1812 or. Yeah, the war of 1812. Do you remember? Were all the states in favor of the war? Were all the regions in favor of the war? I want you to start thinking about the United States now for the next few lectures in terms of regions. Right. And the regions are the north, the south and the west. All right, so north would be New England and New York. And that area, the south would be all of the plantation states, essentially, the slavocracy, as they call it. And then the west would be like, for example, what we would think of today is Illinois. Iowa. Not Iowa, but Illinois and Ohio, Indiana. Those places in there. Right. So we were north, south and west. Tennessee would also be west. When we think about those three regions, were they all in favor of the war? Who were the Americans fighting against in the War of 1812? The British. The British, exactly. So now, was everybody in the United States, were all three regions on board with going to war against the British, or was there one region that was not in favor of that? What was that region? The north. Why the north? How about Danny? Danny, tell me why the northeast was opposed to going to war against the British. Wouldn't one of the reasons be because most of their money come from, like, international trade with the Brits? That's exactly right, Dan. So the northeast was against the war with the British. Right. And do you guys remember, um. In fact, tell me about the Hartford convention. They said that if they weren't going to pull out of the war, then that they would pull out of the Union. Exactly. They threatened to secede from the Union. So that shows the feeling of the. Of the people in the northeast, how strong their feelings were against being at war with their major trading ally. Right. Okay, so now, when did the United States win or lose the war? Well, I mean, it's kind of split down the middle because, I mean, they won in theory, but not really because the country still was divided. Okay. The way we would have to say it is you're on the right track, is that the United States didn't win the war, but they didn't lose the war either. Right. They kind of went back to the way it was before, which we call the status quo ante. Ante means before. Right. Okay, so the status quo ante, the way it was before. So in reality, the best that the Americans could say was that they didn't lose the war. But did Americans think they had won the war? Yeah. Yeah. And why was that? Anybody can answer. I'm done picking on Jacob. Anybody can answer. Did. Why did Americans believe they had won the war even though they. The best they could say was that they didn't lose the war. It had to do with the treaty. The people heard about the treaty. It was the treaty of ghent. Right. But they heard about something else before the treaty. Something happened, actually, even after the war was already over, theoretically. Right. But they heard about that first in the east, before they heard about the treaty. It's kind of what we were just, we started off talking about. Was it about General Andrew Jackson? Uh huh. Andrew Jackson. And what did he do? He, like, achieved a, like, victory in what battle? You're absolutely right. In the battle of New Orleans. Exactly. The battle of New Orleans. Jackson wins this really enormous victory over the british army after the war is already over because remember that the treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, but the battle didn't happen until January 12, or I think something like that of 1815. At any rate, he wins the battle against a much superior british force. And people in the east hear about Jackson winning this war against the. Against the British, and the next thing they hear is that there's a treaty, a peace treaty, right. And so Americans are convinced that they've won the war. Right. And there's this wave of patriotism that kind of erupts in the nation, if you guys will. Remember, when we read about the book about the constitution and when people started to really pay attention to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution was after the war of 1812, during this war, this wave of patriotism. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so now that being said, if the United States sees itself as the big winner and the northeast, the people in the northeast are seen, have been against the war, how does that make the rest of the country feel about the people in the northeast? What are the people in the northeast? They threatened to secede from the war, from the Union. They actually pulled their troops out of the war and threatened to secede, and we won anyway. So how do people feel about people from the northeast? Like traitors. Treason. Exactly. There are a bunch of traitors. They're chumps. Right. And now let's think about what political party was dominant in the northeast. The Federalists. Exactly. The Federalists. So what ends up happening then is that the victory in the war of 1812 brings about the end of the federalist party, right? Because the Federalists are seen. Federalists were actually governing in New England at the time of the war, and the Federalists were seen as chumps and traitors. And so the federalist party disappears, essentially. Right? It doesn't disappear, but, I mean, it ends. And so you guys will remember we talked about the first party system. The first party system was the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans. But the federalist party is going to fade away after the war of 1812. So we go into a period of about 20 years where there aren't parties, right? Essentially, everybody's in the same party, the Democratic Party or the Democratic Republicans, right? And because of that, there isn't a lot of political wrangling in terms of political partisanship. Right. And that's one of the reasons why they call this the era of good feelings, is that there's not a lot of political sniping. But it doesn't mean that there aren't any divisions, okay? Because the divisions that are evident at this point in time are not between political parties, but between regions. Okay? And remember that I told you that there were three regions just a few minutes ago. What are the three regions? Somebody tell me. The north, the south and the west. North, south and west. All right? So this is what I just talked about here. The first thing here."
65,"US1: 514 -US1: 514
","So now let's talk about the political parties here. Okay. And you guys will remember that the first party system was democratic Republicans Jefferson and Federalist Hamilton, and that the federalist party lost influence after the war of 1812 because the federalists were in New England and they were against the War of 1812. And the Americans won the War of 1812, right? Yes. Americans thought they had won the war. Why did they think they had won the war? It has to do with two things. The Treaty of Ghent and the battle of New Orleans. So what was the Treaty of Ghent? It was the peace treaty that ended the war. Okay. And what was. What was the. What was the settlement? Who won? Who won what? Who won? Who lost what? Everything stayed the same at the end. Exactly. So that means that the United States didn't win, but it didn't lose. Right. Americans thought they won because what did they hear about before they heard about the treaty? I just told you what it was. Andrew Jackson won the battle of New Orleans. Exactly. So they thought that was the thing that ended the war and that the Americans had won. And that leads to the era of good feelings, as we talked about before. Right. So, anyway, because the federalists had been against the war, then they really lost influence after the war was over. And then there was a period of time when there wasn't any party system until Andrew Jackson comes along, and then there's going to be two parties. The Democrats were kind of the original democratic Republicans. Kind of. Right. And the Whigs. And do you guys remember who the Whigs are now? This is not that long ago, and it has absolutely everything to do with Andrew Jackson. Who are the wigs? So Andrew Jackson was a very popular politician in Washington. Right? I mean, the establishment political establishment really loved him. Right? No, they hated him. So they formed this new party called the Whigs. Remember that? The Whig party was the party in England that was anti monarchy. So now we have an american political party that's named after an anti monarchy party in England. Why would they name themselves that? Which monarchy are they against? The american monarchy? Which was. Who was the king? Andrew Jackson. King Andrew. Exactly. All right, so, so then what really binds the wigs together? They come from the north and from the south and from the west. And the thing that really binds them together is what? Their hatred over Andy Jackson. Right. They hate Jackson. Okay, so now we're in the 1850s. Where's Jackson? Dead. He's dead. Exactly. So what's going to hold the Whig party together? Well, nothing really. Nothing, really. And keep in mind then, that american politics wasn't really party politics, it was really regional politics. Right. North, south and west. So there's northern Whigs, southern Whigs. Right. And western Whigs and the northern Whigs and southern Whigs are. They were united in their. In their opposition to Jackson, but they're divided in everything else having to do with tariffs and, you know, National bank and things like that. Right. So by the time we get to the 1850s, the Whig party is still there, but it just doesn't have any. Any cohesion, I guess you could say. And there's a number of other parties that are going to appear at this time. One of them is going to be called the american party, and one of the groups. One of you guys groups is working on irish immigration. Right. And the american party was formed as a political party to oppose immigration from Ireland and to oppose Catholicism. Right. Okay, so. So it's kind of a prelude to what we see today. But at any rate, the point here is that there's really. The political situation is in turmoil, I guess you could say. So, in 1854, a bunch of northern Whigs come together and form a new party called the Republican Party, named after the democratic Republicans. Right. And their main organizing issue is going to be to limit the expansion of slavery. Okay. Now, it's not to get rid of slavery. They don't say they're going to get rid of slavery. They say they're going to limit the expansion of slavery, which means that slavery can continue to exist where it does exist, but it won't be allowed anywhere else in the future. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Now, one of the reasons why is because one of the new political parties that helped to form the republican party was a. Was a political party from New York called the Free Soil Party. And the free soil party was in favor of what? Free soil. Right. Meaning that we won't add any more slave territory. Okay, so the thing that we want to keep in mind now is that the major issue of the Republicans, actually, they have two issues. Their main concern is to be the supporters of big business and commerce, but their other issue is going to be the limiting the expansion of slavery. So on the one hand, they're going to be the party of big business, and that's where the republican party is today, or has been. Right. And on the other hand, they're going to be the socially liberal party, actually more like socially radical. Right. And if you think about today, right, the Republicans in 1854 would be like the progressive wing of the Democratic Party today. You guys are with me. So we'll see how that all changes later. But the point here is that the Republican Party is the party of big business, but it's also the party of social reform. And that reform has to do with limiting the expansion of slavery. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so in 1856, there's a presidential election. The election is between John Fremont, who was an army officer, who had come to California, was president at the Bear flag rebellion, and he's going to run as the republican candidate. Millard Fillmore is the american party candidate. I already told you what the american party stood for. What was that again? The other name for this party was the know nothing party. Right. And the reason why is if you ask them what they believed in, say they'd say, I know nothing. Right. Kind of like Sergeant Schultz. So what was it that they were in favor of, and what was it they were against? I just told you not even five minutes ago. Remember, we talked. I talked earlier about irish immigration. I said, one of your projects is about irish immigration. Right? Were they for or against irish immigration? Against it. Against. And why were they against it? Too many people were coming over, and they were flooding the job market. Okay? That's part of their taking away our jobs. That's part of it. Plus, they talked funny, and they were Catholic. Right? And Americans. Many Americans believe that catholicism was against Americanism because Americans. Because Catholics theoretically obey the pope, right? Okay. So the american party would be really the first example of what we would call a nativist party. Have you guys heard of nativism? There's, like, a couple weeks ago, there's a congresswoman from, I think, Florida. I'm not sure where she's from, but she proposed to start a new caucus in Congress called the America first caucus. And the America first caucus was based on the idea that America should be ruled by anglo saxon political traditions. Is there a problem with that? What do you guys think? We're made up of a lot more than that. Okay? So if you want to restrict Americanism or restrict being american to anglo saxon peoples, who, by the way, were illegal immigrants to England back in the fourth century, right. Then you would call that nativism, right? Nativism is, if you're not from here, you don't belong here. It's actually. I mean, it's something that you see everywhere in many other places in the world. The problem in the United States is that nobody's from here. We're all from somewhere. Right? You get what I'm saying? But nevertheless, this is going to be a big issue in the 1840s and 1850s is we don't want those damn foreigners coming over here. Right. Okay, so. And particularly not Catholics. All right? So at any rate, the point here is that this guy runs as on the ticket for the american party, and then the representatives for the south is going to be, or, excuse me, for the Democratic Party is going to be Buchanan. All right? Many people have said that they think Buchanan was probably the worst president, right. And the reason why he wins the presidency is going to be because the Republican, the rest of the electorate was essentially divided. Okay? And so he wins the presidency. But the one thing that we want to keep in mind is that the Republican Party. What was their, what was their platform again? Big business and free soil. Free soil. Which means what? You're right. Absolutely. Limit. Limit the expansion of slavery. Right. Limit the expansion of slavery. Okay, so the Republicans get no support. They're not even on the ballot in the south. Now, why is that? Because people in the south want to expand slavery. Exactly. All right. Okay. So we got to keep that in mind here."

","So now there's this guy. His name is Christopher Cologne. Christopher Cologne. Christopher Cologne, right. And Christobal Cologne is actually a genovese sailor, and he sailed with the Portuguese. And he has developed an idea that that comes from some of the ancient writings that came into the east from this period of time, that calculates that if he sails west, he will find the indies somewhere in here. Okay, do you see where I'm looking at? Right on the map? Okay. Now, those calculations were wrong. Obviously, most people in Europe just laughed at him because they knew that, first off, the idea that everybody thought the world was flat is pretty wrong. All right? I mean, some people may have thought the world is flat, like some people today believe the world is flat, right? But most people who were educated knew that it wasn't flat. And the reason why they knew that was because if you stand at the shore and you watch a ship go out, you can see maybe 11 miles, something like that, right? And then after that, you can't see it anymore. So it's gone. Where did it go? Did it go over the edge of the earth? No, because it comes back. Right. So that means then that the very act of observation proves that there's a curve of the earth. And the fact that you can measure that curve means that you can know about how big the world. So the Europeans knew not only that the world was a globe, but they knew about how big it was. All right? And that's why they knew that Columbus was wrong, because they knew that China wasn't going to be here. It was going to be over here somewhere. And they knew that you could never sail from Spain or from Europe all the way to China. You couldn't carry enough food and water to do it. Okay? What they didn't know was that there was the Americas in between. Nobody knew about the cologne. Columbus. That's what we call Christopher Cologne is Columbus. We call him here in America. Christopher Cologne isn't able to convince anybody that's educated that his idea is correct, except that he is able to convince the queen of Spain, Isabella, who we just talked about a couple of minutes ago. And so she actually sponsors an expedition with three ships, the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. And Columbus then sails off into the west to find the Indies. And on October twelveth, 1492, he cites land. Okay? And actually, nobody really knows what land he cited, but most people think it was probably Espanola, which is where Haiti is today. I don't know if I've got a better map here. Yeah. Most people think it was here somewhere in here. Okay? The main thing is that he spotted land, and then he took out his telescope or whatever and looked, and there were a whole bunch of natives on the land jumping up and down and saying, hooray, we've been discovered, right? No, that's not what happened, but it is a discovery that the Europeans discovered that there was something between Europe and Asia, and the Americans discovered that there were people who would eventually be a great threat to them. Columbus finds the Americas, grabs some Indians to take back to show everybody what he found, right? He believes that he has found the Indies, right? The East Indies. Okay, well, he hasn't found the East Indies. He hasn't found any Indies. He's found Americans. But because he believes it's the Indian, the Indies. That's why everybody here is called Indians. Even though there aren't any Indians here. The Indians are all in India. Okay? You know what I mean? You follow what I'm saying here? All right? And then, actually, Columbus will make four different voyages to America, trying to find the Indians or the chinese and never able to find them. And the reason why is because there aren't any Chinese here, okay? What they eventually realized was that they hadn't found Asia, but instead they had found Novo Mundo. What does that mean? New world. A new world, right? So it's kind of like, if you think about it from a european point of view, it's very much like discovering a whole new planet, right? It's far away, and there's this whole huge territory filled with strange people, right? So it's a whole new world. And the guy who really was able to theorize that, to realize that his name was Amerigo Vespucci, it. And so because he was the one who really remember or discovered that, I guess you could say we named the whole thing after him. So all of the Americas are named after Vesucci. The rest of the story of the conquest you can read about in the."

","So now, here's the thing. If you go to the Barnes and noble today, I actually believe it's still open here in Encinitas. I can't believe anybody still goes to bookstores. But at any rate, if you go to the Barnes and noble and you go into the history section, you will find one shelf of books about World War two, one shelf of books about everything else, and all the rest of the shelves are going to be filled with books about the civil War. Civil war is one of the most studied eras in world history. And so the idea that in something around an hour, we're going to talk about the civil War is really ridiculous. There's no way we can come even close to covering it. But I do want to take a kind of a 50,000 foot view of it to give us, to put it in context with the rest of the class that we've been leading up to this, really, since the very beginning. All right, so that's where we're going. It's not like you're going to know very much about the civil war from listening to this lecture, but you'll have a basic idea. Okay, are you, are you guys with me? Questions, comments about anything? All right, so let's go ahead and take a look then at the north and south. Okay, but let me just mention, one of the things that occurred to me this morning as I was thinking about doing this lecture was we had talked earlier when we talked about the, the election of 1800, how compromise was necessary for democracy to survive. That if Jefferson had not been able to compromise with Hamilton, the country would have died in 1800. But they both were able to make very hard compromises, and because of that, the country survived. We have here a situation where there's a great divide between regions of the country, the north and the south. And there's really fundamental differences in the economies and the culture, the north and the south, that we've already spent some time talking about. The north was an industrial, manufacturing, commercial economy, engaged in world trade, and the south was a plantation, kind of a traditional plantation economy, engaged in export agriculture. So the policies of the country, of the national government tended to favor the north because the population of the north was greater than the population of the south. And the south then believed that because of that, that they were really getting short shrift and being part of this union. And, and if you guys will recall, I mean, going back to the very beginning, the fact that there was a union at all was, I mean, there was a lot of reluctance on the part of particularly the southern states to join in this union, and there's no way they would have joined into the union if they had thought they couldn't get out of it. Right, but that's been a theme, something that we've been looking at over the. Over, really, the last several weeks. And so what happens is that there's a hardening of sentiment between the north and the south, and the hardening of the sentiment is going to focus on slavery. And the reason why slavery becomes the issue is because the north is. The economy of the north is not dependent on slavery like the economy of the south is. And there is a growing sentiment among people that slavery is a moral evil, particularly people in the north. And so the issue of the expansion of slavery and even the abolition of slavery has been a growing issue over the entire period of time that the United States has existed. And remember that the United States was really the first application of the principles of the enlightenment. And the enlightenment includes the idea that all men are created equal, and that, therefore, there should be no slavery. There's no such thing as an inferior person who should be owned by somebody else. All right, so this is a. It's not just an american movement. It's actually the abolitionist movement started in England, but it's. By the time we get to the 1850s, it's. It's very strong in the United States. Okay, so. So then the issue then of slavery and union becomes an issue that can't be compromised on. The south will not compromise on slavery at all. If you guys will recall, the platform of the republican party was to limit the expansion of slavery. Not to do away with slavery, but to limit the expansion of slavery. And the south will not accept that because they'll say that the United States government can't legislate on private property. They'll say that, like when the american colonies rebelled against England over the issue of taxes, which was really the government taking their property without their consent, that if you allow the federal government to legislate on the ownership of private property, that's the same exact sin, I guess you could say, on the part of the central government. So the south will not compromise on the issue of slavery in terms of union. Abraham Lincoln is elected president with the intention of saving, not saving the union, but preserving the union. And that is an issue that he refuses to compromise on. So what we have reached, then, at this point, is an impasse that the south can't compromise on slavery and the north can't compromise on union. And because there is the inability to compromise, what we see is a break. We see a war that comes out of it. You guys, you guys are following me here. Now, one of the reasons why it's so important that we study history is that we learn, theoretically, what works and what doesn't work. And if we have a national government today in which different parties refuse to compromise, we can't preserve our democracy. Do you guys follow what I'm saying here? One of the things that's emblematic of current politics is the idea that compromise has become a bad word. Compromise is something that is looked at as weakness. But in fact, if it is weakness, it's the only weakness that will keep the union together."

","So the arguments against imperialism are going to be really kind of twofold. Right. One of them is more of an idealistic argument, and that is that the United States is not built on the ideas that one country should be able to rule over another country. United States is built on the idea that everybody should be able to rule themselves. So ideologically, it's against american principles, against the american sense of itself, to start to acquire an empire like the british or the French. Okay. The other argument was a racist argument, and that was that the problem that they found out about Cuba was that most of the Cubans are not. So what they came to believe was that if you incorporated non white people into the United States, the United States would not be able to survive because non white people can't rule themselves. That was the same reason why. I mean, they had really the same debate during the mexican american war in 1848, where people were saying, we should just annex all of Mexico. And the Congress said, no, we don't want Mexico because it's full of Mexicans. Right. You follow what I'm saying? They didn't mind taking the southwest because there was nobody there, essentially. Right. But they didn't want Mexico because it was full of Mexicans. And Mexicans can't rule themselves because they're not. Basically. That's. That's the argument that they made. And they make the same argument here about not just Cuba, but anywhere of Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well. Right. Okay. So those are going to be the arguments against creating an. Okay, the arguments in favor of creating an empire are going to be these three. The first one is what we call the white man's burden. This is actually the title of a poem that was written by Rudyard Kipling. And Rudyard Kipling was a british author. He wrote the Jungle Book. Right. And he was a very committed british imperialist. He believed that the British, although they were plundering other countries like India, he believed that that was good for the Indians because they were being civilized. Right? And the British called it the civilizing mission. They had a civilizing mission, and wherever they went, they brought civilization with them. And this fits into the idea that the white Europeans are at the pinnacle of civilization and that all of the people of the world are at different stages of civilization. And that the way you could determine the stages was by skin color. Right. So essentially what that means is the whiter you are, the more civilized you are, and the darker you are, the less civilized you are. Okay. But there's also this idea of progress, which I think we've talked about a little bit. And what that means is that everybody is moving toward a certain goal, a certain maturity, right? And the belief of people in Europe and in the United States is that, well, we white people have achieved the ultimate level of maturity. That doesn't mean we don't have any farther to go, but we're ahead of everybody. Where that fits into the idea of imperialism is that, for example, when the British go to India, they say, okay, well, we're, we're going to take your stuff, but at the same time we're going to make you advance like us by teaching you democracy and industrialization and all these different things. And that would be their duty. Kind of like being a big brother, right? That if you're in a family and you have an older brother and a younger brother, and the older brother takes responsibility for the younger brother to help him come along, to help him to mature. Okay. And that's the way this is kind of like the paternalistic. Also, I can tell you that the first governor of the Philippines, the first american governor of the Philippines is going to say that we had a duty to civilize our little brown brothers, right? You get what saying. Okay, so this is the idea of the white man's burden, that the white man is at the pinnacle of civilization and he has a duty to bring civilization to less advanced civilizations, less advanced people. Okay, so remember last week we talked about social Darwinism and we said that social Darwinism, somebody explained that to me. I want to see if you guys were listening. Social Darwinism is basically the idea that if you're poor, you deserve to die. Or it's like the natural selection type of thinking, except applied to capitalism, right? If you have enough money or you can survive. If you don't have enough money, you don't survive. Okay, you're right. But what I want us to do is to think about it in the terms that Darwin thought about it, right? Because he was thinking about biology and he was saying that in nature, some organisms are going to be able to adapt and survive and others are not going to be able to and they'll die out, right? So what is that? They adapt to what? What happens? The environment changes. Exactly. There's a change of environment. Okay? So if we're looking at the natural environment, we say, okay, we live in a tropical area and then all of a sudden there's an ICE age, right? So some organisms are going to be able to survive, others not. Okay? But in an economic environment, what is the change of environment? It's from agrarianism to industry. Right? Okay. When we looked at it last week, we said, okay, well, in terms of individuals in society, some individuals are going to be able to adapt to the new industrial reality and they'll survive, but others won't. And the ones who can't adapt should be allowed to die so that the ones that are left over would be stronger. That makes sense. That's what social Darwinism is. Okay. And that was the way it was in terms of individuals in society. But it also works in terms of countries in the world. Right? And who's going to be a big believer in this is going to be Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt will believe that the change from agriculture to industry is going to create a challenge for the different countries of the world. Those countries that can modernize are going to become stronger and survive. Those countries that can't modernize are going to die out. Right? And we can see the example of that in China and Japan, right? Because China refused to modernize. They said, we're too cool to modernize. We're already perfect, why should we modernize? And they ended up being carved up by the european powers. Okay? But Japan recognized the threat modernizer be colonized. So they did modernize. They forced modernization, right? But the result of it was that they also became an imperial power and they became an imperial power in Korea and China and later throughout Southeast Asia. Right? You guys are with. So there's, this is the idea of social Darwinism. If you don't modernize, if you don't adapt to the new economic reality, you're going to die out as a country. And Roosevelt was very insistent that the United States should modernize and should acquire overseas empire in order to be able to adapt to this new economic environment. Okay, you guys are with me. So that's going to be another argument in favor of imperialism."

","So we're all familiar with living in a time of political upheaval and turmoil. And I've heard many people say, oh, yeah, well, this is like the sixties, but it's not. The sixties were actually much more divisive, believe it or not, to the point that in the 1960s there were riots. I mean, we've had riots too recently in the last few years, but there were riots and there were people who were actually bombing radio stations and burning down ROTC buildings and things like. So it's not quite as, it's not quite as violent now as it was then. Although we didn't have anybody actually attack the Capitol, they did actually try to levitate the Pentagon at one point. It didn't work. But at any rate. So we want to wonder the reason why. I think that the major theme here goes all the way back to World War two. And we think about at the end of World War two, the United States was the most powerful, the most prosperous economy, and the most successful country on earth. And here we are barely 20 years later, a little over 20 years later, and the United States, some people have argued, is the least politically stable country on earth. And we have to wonder, how did that happen? And we've already talked about the effect of the cold war on the psyche in the United States and everywhere else. And also, you know, the red scare, those things we talked about last week. And a lot of that actually ends up shaking people's confidence in the federal government. Okay, so we're already holding. I mean, Americans have always been suspicious of big government, and I think rightfully so, but, but in this case, Americans are really distrustful of what's happening in government, and the government is doing the right thing. And then we also talked about. Sorry about that. We also talked about the civil rights movement. The civil movement, the way that we portrayed it last week ends with the Voting Rights act of 1965, which seems like a great triumph, but in fact, what it did was it left open a great wound in american society between black and white, which we are still dealing with today. But after the Voting Rights act of 1965, race relations got worse in the United States, not better. You guys watched that movie city on Fire. Did you see that? What did you guys think of that? Tell me about that. Well, I mean, I knew about the Detroit riots, but I didn't know how destructive they had been. And it was really kind of shocking to see all that disruption and how much tension there was between, you know, the races and, and all that going on at the same time as the, you know, the Detroit Tigers playing the ball game and all that stuff. So it was pretty, pretty shocking to see that. Right? Did you guys enjoy the movie? Was it? I thought it would be something you would be interested in mostly because of baseball, because I don't know if you guys realize this, but baseball is the best game that's ever been devised. Right? So at any rate, that kind of demonstrates this racial divide between whites and blacks in the United States, right? And this is going to be something, a theme that carries through the sixties and into the seventies, really, even today to a certain extent. Okay. So we have that. And then the main issue that we're going to be looking at for the 1960s is another kind of a political divide, which is liberals versus conservatives. Okay? So in liberals, what we mean by liberals in the 1960s is John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and their ideas of the role of the federal government in the lives of people. Okay? And this argument really goes back to the depression and maybe even earlier, but particularly to the depression. Johnson and Kennedy are going to carry into the presidency with them the idea of Franklin Roosevelt, that the purpose of the federal government is to ensure the welfare of the people of the United States. All right? The difference between Roosevelt and Kennedy, and particularly Johnson, is going to be that Roosevelt was addressing an economic crisis, was happening at that time, and Johnson is going to be trying to reshape society in such a way that the federal government is seen as the protector of all the people or the provider, I guess you could say, for all the people and many people. Conservatives are going to see this as a violation of the original intent of the Constitution, because the original. From their point of view, the original intent of the constitution is that the federal government is limited to doing only those things that the state governments can't do. So the federal government is limited by the Constitution to conducting foreign policy and regulating trade, regulating interstate commerce and those sorts of things. And in everything else, education, infrastructure, everything else is left up to the states. Okay? And morality, laws, everything is left up to the states. And that's the way conservatives think about it. Okay? So now when we think about this divide, then it kind of comes to the forefront after Kennedy's assassination and Johnson becomes president. Johnson wanted to be president. He wanted to run for president on his own. And Johnson thought that the best way to do that would be to carry out Kennedy's wishes for what would happen in the. In the federal government, right? So he introduced a series of reforms called the Great Society programs and the Great Society. The idea behind the great society programs is that the United States government, with all of its wealth and all of its power, should be able to create a society where there was no poverty, where there was no illiteracy, where there was no ill health. So the great society programs were designed to pull people out of poverty, put them to work, make sure that everybody had a good education, make sure that everybody had good health care. The, and you can't really, you can't really deny that that was a, those were lofty goals. Right. The problem, according to conservatives, was it was all unconstitutional because the purpose that all those things should be handled by the states, they shouldn't be handled by the federal government. That's the way that, that's the way conservatives saw it. Okay, so these programs, some of those programs we all kind of rely on, Medicare, Medicaid, I think that's about it. From that period, education grants to colleges and schools and things like that all come from the great society programs. Right. And you can kind of see their point. On the one hand, you could say, okay, well, the federal government actually sets the agenda for education in many cases in the United States. Okay, we have a department of education. Okay, but where in the government, where in the constitution does it say the federal government should have anything to do with education? It doesn't. Right? So conservatives will say, well, the federal government is overreaching. How do they get away with it? Well, the way they get away with it is to say, well, you don't have to do this, but if you don't, you're not going to get any of our money. You follow what I'm saying here? And so basically, then if you're an independent school district and you say, I don't want to teach what the federal government tells me to teach, that's fine, but then you're not going to get any money. And because the lure of the money is always so great, the federal government then is able to insert itself into education decision making. You guys follow what I'm saying here? Questions, comments about this? Okay, so now what that does is it creates a sense of, by many people in the United States, the conservatives, that the federal government is out of control. It's too big. It's out of control. And we have to realize the people that feel this aren't just a bunch of right wing nut jobs. This is what's being challenged is their fundamental understanding of what it means to be an American. And you have to keep in mind that people were actually taught at this time what it means to be an American. They had civics classes in school where you would go and you would learn how the government works and things like that, which we don't have that much of anymore. At any rate, the point here is that there is this dividend."

","So what happens then? Jackson is elected. And one of the ways we can see, I mean, one demonstration of how things change is that when politicians in Washington, politics in Washington had been controlled by elites from the very beginning, and the common people were pretty much just left out. But when, when Jackson was elected the first, on his inauguration night, he had a big party at the White House and he invited everybody over, right? He says, everybody, come on over to the White House. We're going to have a party. So the White House is filled up with all these common people, mechanics, farmers, different kinds of people. And it was chaos. It's kind of like inviting a bunch of college students to your party at your apartment. You can imagine what the place is going to look like the next day. Right? So, and this is what happened at the White House. And the only way they could get the people out was to move all the booze out on the lawn so that the people would go out to get the booze and they wouldn't let them back in. Right. But that shows this kind of movement towards a more common or more democratic atmosphere in american government. People who are, who are not elite, feeling that they have ownership in the government. You guys follow me here. Questions, comments about this? Okay, well, this is going to be shocking to the political elite, right? This is going to be something that causes a great deal of stress among the people who are the elite. And what the result of it is going to be is that the people who, people who don't have anything else in common, are you going to unite because they don't like Andrew Jackson? They want to get rid of Andrew Jackson. So they form a new party. And this new party is going to be called the Whigs. Alright? So we had, remember we had democratic Republicans and federalists before the federalist party essentially went away. Then there was no party. And now we have a new party, a new two party system with the Democrats being represented by Andrew Jackson and the Whigs being everybody who doesn't like Andrew Jackson. Right. So now, when we, remember, I think it was on Monday, we talked about the american system and we talked about how american politics was driven by regional concerns, north, south and west. Right. In this case, what we're going to see happening is that those concerns will remain. But the motivator behind the Whigs is going to be their hatred of Andrew Jackson. Right. So it's really people who really don't have anything else in common coming together and forming a party to, to oppose the man that's in power. Okay, you guys are with me questions? Comments about this? Anybody? Okay, well, so these people call themselves Whigs. Why do they call themselves that? Well, it's not because they put wigs on their head, because that's w I g. Right. Whigs are the party in England who are anti monarchy. So why would an american political party name themselves after an english political party that is anti monarchy? What monarchy? Are they against the english monarchy? No, these people, these american politicians are not against the english monarchy. What monarch are they against? An american monarch. Yeah. Which one? Andrew Jackson. King Andrew. Exactly. King Andrew. Right. So they believe that Andrew Jackson is acting like a king, and that's. That's basically their. Their political platform. Okay, questions? Comments? The last thing I want to mention about this is, do you. Does anybody. Have you ever wondered why the Democratic Party is represented by a donkey? Because Andrew Jackson, when people were. People who were opposed to Andrew Jackson, called him the jackass. Andrew Jackass. And so the jackass became the symbol of Andrew Jackson, and he was really the founder of the Democratic Party. Right. So that's why the Democratic Party has its symbol as a donkey. Okay, questions? It's still a jackass. They just don't call it that. They call it donkey instead. All right, questions? Comments about."

","The United States convinces Diem to stop the elections in 1956 because it becomes obvious that if they do hold the election, that Ho Chi Minh would be elected, and that would mean that Vietnamese would become communists. And that's something that the United States doesn't want to allow. And so they stopped the elections. And as a result of that, the North Vietnamese claim that the south has broken the deal that they made at the Geneva accords, and they invade South Vietnam. Right. And so then the South Vietnam is going to be fighting a war against North Vietnam. And at the same time, there's a development of another group in South Vietnam called the National Liberation Front, otherwise known as the Viet Cong. And the Viet Cong are going to be communist sympathizers who are allied with North Vietnam. So not only are they fighting a war against the north vietnamese army, which is being supplied by the Chinese and the Russians, but they're also fighting a war, a guerrilla war, against the Viet Cong, who are not recognizable because they don't have. They're not. They're not an established force. They're just terrorists, essentially. Right? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right. Okay, so what's going to happen then is there will be so much unrest in Vietnam, South Vietnam, that Ngo Dinh Diem will be. No, din Diem will be basically lose control of the country. And the United States will start looking for an alternative to Diem because they want to establish a government in Vietnam that would be popular enough to defeat Ho Chi Minh. As it happens, there is no alternative to Diem because Jiem has removed all of his opposition. And so what ends up happening then is that the United States is faced with a dilemma. If they abandon Diem, then there's a real chance that the south would fall to communism, which would be seen as a blow to american cold War strategy, I should say, if they abandon the government of Vietnam. But if they don't. If they. If they. If they. So if they don't intervene in Vietnam, it's going to be obvious that. That the south will fall. You guys follow I'm saying? So now there's going to be a coup conspiracy led by generals of the south vietnamese army, which the idea was that they promised. They went to Kennedy, President Kennedy, and proposed to him that they would get rid of Diem and they'd establish a new government with a new president. And Kennedy endorsed that plan with the caveat that if they. When the generals took over, that they would just get rid of Diem and they wouldn't hurt anybody else. What ends up happening is that the generals take over and they kill Diem and his whole family. Right. And at this point, then Kennedy orders a review of american policy in Vietnam, and some people will argue that he was ready to abandon Vietnam. I don't think that that's true, but at least that's what people will say. We don't know whether or not it's true, because before the review was finished, Kennedy had been killed. Right. At any rate, questions or comments so far? So now we have basically Vietnam with almost no government, and they're on the verge of collapse based on the movements of the north vietnamese army and also the Viet Cong. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? And up to this point, the Americans have been supporting the South Vietnamese. And one of the ways that they did that was by blockading the approach to North Vietnam with the american navy. What's going to end up happening is that there's going to be, I should say it this way, that the United States is looking for an alternative, a way to intervene Vietnam. And that incident is going to happen here in 1963, and, excuse me, in 1964, in what's August of 1964, which is in an incident called the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Okay? This is the Gulf of Tonkin right here. And what happened in the Gulf of Tonkin was that there was a. An american destroyer, the Maddox, which was patrolling, and in fact, they were doing more than just patrolling. They were actually supporting south vietnamese military activity in North Vietnam. But they reported that they had been attacked, that they had been attacked by two gunboats. And then the following, I think, two days later, they reported that they were being under attack from some radar, whatever they call them, on radar. They see an attack coming on radar. And as it later turned out, there were actually american airplanes in the sky at the time. And the american pilots reported there was no activity. So whatever that the sailors on the Maddox saw, it probably wasn't an attack. But nevertheless, the report of the attack is going to be enough to convince President Johnson to ask the United States Congress for money to start to oppose communism in North Vietnam. So this is going to be called the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. Basically, what ends up happening is Johnson asked for money to fight against communism in Vietnam. The Congress is basically going to give him a blank check, saying whatever it takes. Okay. And I want you guys to know this, that in 1964, when the United states declared that it was going to send troops to Vietnam, the american people were almost 100% behind it. Okay? The resolution in Congress to provide funds to fight the war in Vietnam was almost unanimous. There was only one abstention. Okay, you guys get me here. So, so the reason why it's important for me to point this out is because in 1960, 419 65 Americans are all for the war in Vietnam. But by 1968, Americans are going to be all against it and we're going to wonder why. Okay? And we'll talk about that on a different day. Okay? Questions? Comments so far? All right, so then the United States then, then introduces troops. They start actually a bombing campaign called Operation Rolling Thunder which is going to continue to drop bombs on North Vietnam for basically the next ten years almost continuously. And at the same time eventually the United States introduced troops and by July of 1965 there's 100 hundred thousand american troops and then by late 19, by 1968 there's almost 500,000 american troops in, in South Vietnam. Okay. With the idea being that they were going to try to stop communism in Vietnam."

","The discovery of America had enormous impact on Europe. Okay? And one of the main impacts of the discovery of America was that Europe started to be able to extract resources from the Americas that made Europe wealthy, right? So if you remember, I said before that the economy of this system was subsistence, meaning they needed everybody to produce enough for everybody to live, right? It was also stagnant. The population of Europe was stagnant, really, throughout the Middle Ages. And the reason why was because they couldn't grow enough food for the population to grow. What would happen would be they'd have really good crops for a couple of years and the population would start to grow, and then they'd have bad crops and there'd be a famine and people would die off, right? So the population remained relatively stagnant over a thousand years. Right? But after America was discovered, they introduced new crops from the Americas, like the potato, right? You wouldn't think of potatoes as being very sexy in terms of world history, right? But because of the introduction of the potato, the european population started to grow, right? And so there's going to be an increase in population in Europe as the result of the discovery of America. Beyond that, there's going to be other resources, like, for example, silver, that the Spanish are able to extract silver from Mexico. That's why there were so many miners in Mexico, right? They were able to extract silver from Mexico and Peru, and that made the spanish empire very rich. And then later the British and the French and the Dutch will get in on that as well, right? And so eventually what ends up happening is that Europeans have a very interesting cash flow problem. And the problem is they have more cash than they know what to do with. And it'll start off with the people who are, say, plantation owners in America are going to go. They didn't go to America because they wanted to live in America. They wanted to live in Europe, right? And they wanted to live high in Europe, okay? And so what happens is that they go to the Americas, they make lots of money, they go back to Europe, they buy out the old aristocracy, and then they buy their places to live, and they buy their manners, and they spend money buying positions at court, and they spend money buying art and things throughout Europe, right? And once they've done that, they own essentially everything, and they still have more money than they know what to do with. And so eventually what they do is they start to invest that money in technology. There will be a creation of machines that will make production more productive, right? Okay? Manufacturing will be more productive. And there's a certain machine that does that. Does anybody want to guess what that is? It's the steam engine. Steam engine. We have the verdict of the steam engine. Yes. Okay. So the steam engine. What the steam engine does is it revolutionizes a couple of different things. On the one hand, we have what's called the transportation revolution. And what that means is that essentially the speed of the world increases from about 3 screaming 25 mph, right? And you're going to say, well, 25 very fast. But many of you have sat on the freeway, on a 405 freeway in LA, and you know that 25 miles an hour is fast, right? But the main thing, if you think about it in terms of numbers, right, is that 25, little over eight times faster than 3 mph, which is the speed of the world before the transportation revolution. I'm talking about steam engines. I'm talking about steam trains and steam boats, right? Okay. And so if that's eight times faster, what that really does is it makes the world eight times smaller, doesn't it, that essentially the world is eight times smaller than it was before. Okay. And if you think about, for example, in terms of american history, many of you guys have heard of Lewis and Clark. Tell me about Lewis and Clark. They actually went to the west coast, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. The Lewis and Clark expedition, right? Yeah. Right. The Lewis and Clark expedition. They went from Pittsburgh to the west coast of the United States, and then they ended their expedition in Louisville, Kentucky. Right. So how long did it take for them to go from Pittsburgh to the west coast and back to Louisville? It was 18 months. Right, okay, so that was in 18. Three. And that was before the introduction of the steam engine. But if we go to 1865, there's the completion of the transcontinental railroad, and now it's possible to go from the east coast to the west coast in two weeks. You see what happens. And it's because of that that Americans were able to subdue the north american continent. If you think about when Jefferson bought Louisiana, he thought it would take 1000 years to settle that territory. And yet the whole thing was settled within a century. Right? And it's because of the transportation revolution. So that has an enormous influence on world history, on american history. Okay?"

","The divergence in colonization motives between Virginia and New England largely centers around economic versus ideological underpinnings. Specifically, Virginia's colonization was primarily driven by economic pursuits. Conversely, New England's establishment was fundamentally influenced by ideology, with a significant emphasis on theology or religion, which itself can be viewed as a form of ideology. This delineates a clear distinction. One group of colonies emerged from a quest for economic gain, while the other was conceived from religious ideological convictions. Beyond motivations for colonization, there were significant regional geographical differences. New England's landscape sharply contrasts with that of the Virginia tidewater region. New England, characterized by its healthier environment, dense forests, and rocky soil, was ill suited for plantation agriculture. This geographical reality precluded the cultivation of tobacco or other typical plantation crops found in Virginia. Consequently, new England settlers predominantly established small family operated farms. These farms could not be sustained over time because of the inheritance practice among the protestant settlers, which differed markedly from that of their anglican or catholic counterparts. Traditionally, european inheritance through the Middle Ages was governed by the principle of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherits the entire estate, a practice that ensured the consolidation of wealth and estates within aristocratic families. However, in New England, a system of partable inheritance was adopted whereby every son received an equal share of the inheritance. To illustrate, consider an estate owned by a Catholic with seven sons. Upon his death, only the eldest son would inherit the estate, thus maintaining its unity and ensuring its perpetuation within the family. This mechanism was a cornerstone for the intermarriage among aristocracy in Europe aimed at preserving estate cohesion. In contrast, protestant settlers in New England divided an estate equally among all descendants. For example, if a settler had four sons, the estate would be subdivided into four equal parts, each son receiving a portion. This division process, repeated over generations, could eventually result in the land parcels becoming too small to sustain the families. This transition to partable inheritance had profound implications for the colonial New England economy. It fostered the development of numerous smaller farms, promoting a more egalitarian distribution of land, but also leading to challenges related to land fragmentation and sustainability. This system of inheritance, alongside the region's geographical characteristics, shaped the distinctive economic landscape of New England. Contrasting with the plantation based economy prevalent in regions like Virginia, many New Englanders are forced to seek alternative means of livelihood when they find their inherited farms too small to sustain traditional farming. Imagine being in Massachusetts during the 17th or 18th century. Faced with the dilemma of seeking financial stability without the option of farming, there was always the temptation to move west, seeking new lands. But westward expansion presented its own set of challenges, notably the presence of formidable native american nations and territories claimed by France. Given these constraints, limited farming opportunities and the complexities of moving west, many people turned their sights towards urban areas in search of employment. This shift led to the emergence of more mercantile economic activities. Timber logging surfaced as a viable industry, capitalizing on the abundant forests. This industry played a crucial role in shipbuilding, providing essential materials like masts. Consequently, shipbuilding burgeoned into a significant industry. Commercial fishing also emerged as another cornerstone of the New England economy, with Boston evolving into an important trade hub. In reality, Boston became notably central to the slave trade during much of the 18th century, with the english slave trade largely anchored in the city. Thus, we observe the development of a modernizing economy in New England, distinctly shaped by its geographical constraints and the ingenuity of its inhabitants. In adapting to these limitations, the economic development of New England mirrors similar developments toward modernization in England.

","The first thing we want to say, well, american imperialism. America doesn't have an empire, but America has essentially been imperialistic since the very beginning, even in the colonial period, because the definition that we're using for imperialism is that one country controls the resources of another country for its own economic benefit. All right? That's essentially what we mean by imperialism, and that's what drove imperialism in the 19th century. All of the industrial powers, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Japan, and the United States, will also become imperial powers driven by their industrial economies. Okay? So what we want to do, though, is american imperialism is going to be a bit different from european imperialism for a couple of reasons. And so what we want to do is go all the way back to think about, well, where do Americans actually start to be? Or how do Americans conduct foreign policy? All right? And to understand that, we go all the way back to the Washington administration, and Washington, as you guys knew, know, served two terms, and then he decided not to run again. Okay? And he set the precedent then for two terms in the presidency. But at the end of his presidency, he thought of himself kind of as an elected king. And the way that a king would have been thought of at that time, traditionally, was that the king was the father and the protector of the people. So when Washington retired from public office, he thought that it would be important for him to make. It would be important for him to leave his children with some. And so that's where we come to Washington's farewell address. It wasn't a speech. It was actually a document that was written. It was actually written by Alexander. But the point here is that it says what Washington. The advice that Washington wanted to leave Americans when he retired and find the whole document, it's not very long, it's very prescient, has a lot of really interesting things in it. And the two that we're really concerned about today is the way that Washington defined american foreign policy and american foreign policy. What we have to understand about America at the time of Washington's presidency or in the first years of the republic was that the United States was very weak and that United States was in the presence of two very powerful, antagonistic powers in Europe who were at each other's throats. That was England and France. Right. England and France both wanted the United States to be on their side in the wars between them, and they really did a lot of interfering in american politics. But Washington, realizing that America was weak, decided that United States should remain neutral, that United States should not pick sides, because his idea was that if the United States did pick sides, and they picked the wrong side. That would be the end of America, because either the French or the British could have destroyed. And so he says, we're going to stay out of Europe's affairs. But at the same time, Washington is going to say that we should insist on what he called unrestricted commercial ties or unrestricted free trade. And what that means is that we can trade with whoever we want to, right? And we're not going to be limited by european mercantilism. So if you guys remember, maybe you don't remember what mercantilism essentially was that the colonies could only trade with the mother country, right? And then the mother country could trade with other countries. But what the american system was the first system, really, that relied on what they call free trade, what we call unrestricted free trade, that any country could trade with any other country. So the United States insists on the ability to trade with any country that it wants. So these are the two main pillars, I guess you could say, of american foreign policy. On the one hand, we're not going to get involved in european affairs, and on the other hand, we are going to insist that we can trade with whoever we want. Okay? And sometimes those come into conflict. So, for example, the war of 1812 was about the British trying to keep the Americans from trading with the French. Okay? And the Americans insisted that they ought to be able to trade with the French. So the Americans went to war with the British, and we'll just leave it at that. America survived that. So that was an interesting episode. But at any rate, it shows us that the two principles actually sometimes go into conflict with each other. Okay. The thing about these principles is that they are going to remain almost as if it was law all the way up until, really world War I. United States will remain a continental power all the way up until World War I, with very few exceptions. Okay. But in 1824, there was a crisis in the Americas, and the crisis was that all of the spanish american colonies were breaking away from Spain. And Americans had two interests in these new countries that were breaking away from Spain. One of them was that the United States saw common cause with these revolutionary movements in Spanish America, because many of them were actually inspired by the american revolution. Right? So the Americans thought this was the progress of our revolution, that it's starting now, and it's going to eventually spread everywhere. This idea of liberty, the liberty that I defined for you on the second day of the class, I think, right? Liberty with an exclamation point. Okay. So there's this ideological affinity between North Americans and Spanish Americans. All right? But then there's another interest, and that is in trade. Because when the spanish colonies become independent, then they can trade with whoever they want. But when they're actually colonies of a european power, they can't. They have to trade only with that european power. So Americans are going to be very interested in maintaining the independence of spanish american countries because it helps them to maintain trading partners. All right, you guys get what I'm saying? So what we see then is we have two really different interests in the United States maintaining the independence of spanish american countries. One of them is ideological and one of them is economic. Okay? What we're going to notice is that american foreign policy will be characterized like american politics. American foreign policy will be characterized by that relationship between idealism and economics, right? So when it comes to foreign policy, the question is going to be, is the United States the beacon of freedom, liberty, justice and equality in the world, or is the United States a rapacious imperial predator? Right. And the answer to that question is going to be yes. Yes. The United States does believe in freedom, liberty, equality and justice, and they try to instill those principles in every place where they intervene. But at the same time, Americans want to make a lot of money just like the rest of the imperial powers. So the United States will act in the same way as many of the other industrial. So. So here's where the dilemma comes in for american foreign policy as compared to, say, for example, british foreign policy, right? So the british foreign policy is going to be the same, except that the British don't have this idea of spreading liberty, right? And the French and the Germans, they basically say, okay, we're here to get your stuff, and they're pretty much upfront about it, right, but Americans don't do that. Americans go and say, okay, we're here to make you all free and Democrats, and at the same time we're going to take your stuff, right? So it makes other people think that Americans are. American foreign policy is hypocritical. I mean, even Americans think that, all right, because we say, okay, well, you say that you stand for freedom, justice, liberty, equality in the world, but at the same time, you just come in and take our stuff like anybody else. Right? So you're really hypocritical. The truth is that american foreign policy isn't hypocritical. It's mentally unstable. It's a split personality. America has two personalities at once, and I think that's what makes american foreign policy so difficult for others to understand. But anyway, so the Monroe doctrine is going to say, okay, what happens is that Americans decide that they're going to impose their will on the Americas, and the way that they're going to do that is that they're going to declare this doctrine, doctrine was declared in 1824 when President Monroe was president, right? And Monroe doctrine will say that the Americas are close to new colonization, no new colonies in the Americas. But the quid pro quo will be that we're not going to establish any colonies in Europe. Okay? So now, if you think about 1824, here's this little country on the east coast of the north american continent telling these great european powers to stay out. What do you think those powers think about America's doctrine? They probably think it's ridiculous. How can you tell me what to do? Exactly. It's almost like if you think about, one of the ways I've tried to imagine it is if you went to the playground and you saw a sandbox there, and there's a little three year old in the sandbox saying, it's my sandbox, stay out, right? And what would you do? You say, well, that's a little brat, right? It's like, try stop me. Try stop me. Exactly. In 1824. Nobody took it serious in 1824, and there was no reason for them to. But United States, during the 19th century is going to become incredibly powerful, right? So that by 1900, the United States really is the most powerful industrial country on earth. Okay? When Americans said that they were going to enforce their will on the Americas, at first they couldn't, but then they could, right? And one of the, I think the height, really, of this idea of american hegemony. This is the word. It's kind of like a. It's domination. American domination of. Of the Americas comes in 1895, because there's a crisis that happens in South America, and I don't really have maps, I wish, but. But there's a crisis that happens in South America where there's Venezuela and there's British Guyana, a colony of Britain. And the border between those two countries had always been fluid. Nobody had ever really fixed the border and nobody really wanted to, because it wasn't country that was worth anything until somebody found gold there, right? And then all of a sudden, the Venezuelans say, oh, that's ours. It's always been ours, right? And the say, no, no, it's not, it's ours. And they threaten to send troops to America, but what happens is Venezuela actually calls upon the United States to support them in their conflict with Britain. And the Americans will make a statement based on the Monroe doctrine, which is called the only corollary to the Monroe doctrine. And what that corollary says is that the United States is practically sovereign in the Americas and its fiat is law. Okay? So now let's think about what does that mean? What does practically sovereign mean? Sovereign means like to rule over something. Correct? Right, exactly. So. So that says the United States is practically sovereign. What does that, you know, almost there. Well, that's one of the ways we think about it. But really, if you think about the word itself, it means in practice, right? It might not be official, but in practice it's there. Right? So in practice, the United States is sovereign over all of the Americas. What does that mean? That means the United States rules, right? And to what extent does the United States rule? Its fiat is law. So what is a fiat? I know it's a little italian car, but that's not what they were talking about, right? The fiat comes from the word. It's a latin word. Okay? If you look at the logo or the motto of the University of California, Fiat lux, let there be light. Right? So the idea, it comes from the biblical idea that God said something, and it was so God said, let there be light, and there was light. That's a fiat, right? So if America says this is so, it's so, essentially the United States claims godlike power over the Americas. You guys get what I'm saying? So this is going to be american foreign policy in the Americas, that the United States will consider itself to be sovereign in the Americas, and that the United States really is unchallenged in that. The outcome of the Venezuela boundary crisis that I was just telling you about was that the British backed off. And the reason why wasn't because they were afraid of the Americans so much that they had interest in other parts of the world and didn't want to get bogged down in a conflict in the Americas. Right? So what that really does, though, it feeds the Americas at the US sphere of influence."

","The first thing we're going to do is we're going to talk about America. So we haven't talked about America at all yet. We've been talking about Europe. And the first thing that we want to do is we want to talk about what was in America before the Spanish got here. And the way that we're going to understand the encounter between Europeans and Americans is by looking at the economics of it, right? The economics of colonization. The idea here is that the way that Europeans behaved towards Americans was colored by what kind of a society, what kind of an economic society they lived in. All right? So just right off the front, we need to understand that the Europeans came to America to make profit, all right? And depending on what kind of a society they found in America, depended on how they were going to make that profit. When we look at the Americas at the beginning, say, of the 16th century, we can see two different kinds of societies that have developed, and we're going to characterize them by either a surplus economy or a subsistence economy. And surplus economy means that they make more than they need to live, that a certain group of the population is able to make more than is needed for everybody to live. So the surplus then goes to the top, and we'll talk about more in a second. In a subsistence economy, like a hunter gatherer society, right? These are people that basically wander around looking for foraging for food and hunting and things like that. And it has a very different social. So when the Spanish first came to America, they came to the Caribbean. And in the caribbean islands, the natives there had a subsistence economy. And in a subsistence economy, everybody works to create enough for everybody to live. And so there's this basic equality that's built into a subsistence economy. Everybody is needed in order to produce enough for everybody to live. And that also means that everybody is engaged in producing what's needed to live. So nobody's really freed up to do other things. And what happens, and this happens everywhere. It doesn't happen just in America. It happened in Mesopotamia. It happened in China and Africa and in Europe. And what happens is that at some point, this subsistence economy, this non sedentary group, is going to access a source of food that will make it possible for them to settle, all right? So the reason why they've been moving around, they've been non sedentary, they've been moving around is because they needed to follow the food supply. But if they create a local food supply that they don't have to move to access, like planting corn or something like that, then they can stay in one place, and then once they start to stay in one place, then they will start to build structures. And these structures, more permanent structures like houses, and then later temples and other buildings like that, they essentially start to build cities, right? So the greek word for city is kivis, right. And that's where we get our word, civilization. So when we look at what we think in a technical term is civilization, it just means that people have organized to live in cities. It doesn't have a qualitative aspect like Europeans have assigned to it. So often we think about, well, there's civilized people, and then there's savages, right? And civilized people are good, and savages are bad. Right? Well, the reality is that there are people who have organized themselves to live in cities, and there are people who have not organized themselves to live in cities, and they're not qualitatively different. You can't say one is good and the other is bad. It's just different. Okay, so at any rate, the point is that once they've settled down and they've started to build their cities, eventually what ends up happening is that the people who are. What happens is that the structure starts to stratify, meaning that instead of everybody being on the same level, certain people will be freed up to do other things. So this is actually a representation of what we call the aztec social society, social hierarchy, although they didn't call themselves Aztecs, but we'll just let that go for now. But what happened was in the beginning, it was everybody creating enough for everybody to live. But after a while, the social society started to stratify. And so we can see at the time of the discovery, there were these different levels of society. There were, at the bottom, slaves who were sacrificed and then slaves who worked. And then there's a group called Mayekis, who are like peasants. They're kind of like campacinos today. Or if you go, like when you go down to Home Depot and you see a bunch of people waiting for work, it's like that. Those would be the Mayekis. And then the masequaltin are the craftsmen, the people who own their tools, and they work in the cities, and they actually have ownership in society. And it's these bottom four groups that will make enough that other people can pursue other pursuits. Right? The pushteca are going to be the merchants that will be traveling around. The pupiltin are going to be the nobles and the warriors, the war leaders. And then at the top, there's the platoani, which is at the time of the discovery of America. That was Montezuma II. We call him Montezuma, and we think of him as the emperor. But it wasn't really an empire in the way that we would think about it. And I'll talk about that in a minute. Right. So at any rate, when the Spanish came, they found one of these two kinds of societies, right? So the first one they found in the Caribbean was this kind, and then later they found this kind in Mexico, and then later in Peru. The question we want to ask ourselves is if we're going to look for value. If I'm a european coming to America and I'm looking for a place to extract, a way to extract value, how will I do that? Where is the value located? All right? And if we look in this social structure, we have to ask ourselves, is the value in the people or is it in the land? What do you guys think it's going to be in the people? Keeping in mind that there's only enough produced for everybody to live, there's nothing left over, right? So if they're not making anything that's left over, then the people would not be a source of wealth, right. Instead, they would have to extract the wealth from the land. That would mean that rather than letting the people extract value because there isn't anything left over, then they use the land to extract value. And then what happens to the people? You don't need them anymore, right? So they'll be enslaved or they'll be pushed out or they will be killed. One of the things that we'll notice is that in the Caribbean, most of the native, almost all of the native population was completely wiped out, right, through disease and other things. It's not like they went on a killing spree or anything like that, but the whole population essentially was wiped out. And the only thing you remember of the Caribbean Indians is the name, the Caribbean, right? So, at any rate, that's going to be the spanish come to America. They find this area where they want to extract value. The only place they can extract value from is the land. So they move the people off the land, right? And they use the land for themselves. Okay? Now, in this structure, this is a different structure because you have the bottom group making enough for everybody to live on, and then the top group is freed up, there's a surplus, right? So now if we look at where are we going to find value in this society? Is it in the people or is it in the land? In the people. In the people, because the people are producing value. Okay? So the spanish strategy, when they see these kinds of societies, is to just cut off the top and put themselves up. In the beginning, the conquest of Mexico, Montezuma II was the emperor, the clatawani, the head, and all of the money went up to Montezuma. But what happened was that the Montezuma was killed, and the Spanish theoretically put the king of Spain at the top, which means that all of the wealth that's being produced by the society will, instead of going to the nobles of the Aztecs, will go to the nobles of the Spanish. You follow what? So now, so now one of the things that we'll notice is that if you're a Spaniard and you want to extract value, the destruction of the people in this bottom area is going to be really essential, right? But the destruction of the people here would be. Would be destructive of the source of wealth. It'd be like killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Right? And so what that means is that the Spanish are going to be interested in maintaining this social structure, right? Because this social structure is producing wealth. If they destroy the social structure, they destroy the source of their wealth. You see what I'm saying? Well, the reason why this is important, and we'll talk a little bit more about this later today, is because when we think about the conquest of Mexico, we think of the bloodthirsty Spanish coming to America and wiping out all the Indians and taking their. And in effect, that is what happened. But it wasn't what the Spanish intended. So something happened that caused a rapid and drastic decline in population that wasn't really initiated intentionally by the Spanish. What was that? What caused the Indians to die? A disease. Disease, exactly. The Europeans introduced diseases that the Spanish had no immunity to, that the natives had no immunity to, and that caused a rapid decline. And with that decline in population, we also see a collapse of this social structure. Right. In essence, the wealth producing machine is going to be killed off by the Spanish, but not intentionally. All right. Okay. Let me just mention something else here. We use the word Indians. The reason why I use that word is because we know what we're talking about when we say Indians. But we also know that the people who live in the Americas were not from India. Right? To say that everybody in North America is an Indian is like saying everybody from Belfast to Beijing is a Mexican. Right? Okay. It's really inaccurate, historically or genealogically, I guess you could say. But it is a word that we can use that we can generalize a population that way. And we'll talk a little bit more about that later."

","The problem was not just an american problem. It was a problem that happened in every industrializing nation. And so what happened was there was a development of different approaches to solve the problems of industrialization. And we're going to look at three today, and those three are going to be common. Communism, social Darwinism, and positivism. All right, I'm going to give you kind of a big picture overview of each of these and talk about where they were popular and where they were not popular. Okay, so communism was kind of summarized in a book that was written by this guy here, Karl Marx, and also his friend, the factory owner, Frederick Ingalls. And the idea behind communism was essentially what I have presented to you in class, which was that the problems of industrialization arose out of a shift in labor distribution and the means of production. So essentially the theory was that the owners, because of industrialization production, the means of production becomes more expensive. It's out of the reach of regular workers. And so only the wealthy can actually own the means of production. But because they own the means of production, they get the surplus from the labor. And then the people who actually work on the means of production only own their labor. And the result is that they get a subsistence wage, which is basically not really enough to live on. In fact, in some cases, it wasn't even a subsistence wage. All right? That part of the communist manifesto, which is the first part of it, actually ends up being true because it's a correct historical analysis of what happened in Western Europe. Okay? The rest of the communist manifesto is not true because what was predicted was that communism would. Because communism. Because capitalism created this new class, the proletariat, who were oppressed and unhappy. That because the nature of capitalism is that in order for a capitalist economy to be successful, it has to grow, right? So what that means is that we have to continue to produce more and more and more and more in order for capitalism to be healthy. And that means that we need more and more and more workers, right? So the theory then was that communism, that capitalism would continue to grow until the oppressed class was so big that they would spontaneously rise up and overthrow the owners and take away their stuff. And then at that point, they would transition control of the manufacturing, of the manufacturing, essentially, to the workers, everybody owning everything in common. And that would eventually lead to a worker's paradise. Right? So the idea here then about communism is that the workers are going to be so unhappy, eventually the workers will become so unhappy that they will violently overthrow the capitalist system and establish communism, which is, in essence, no government, right. Because the purpose of government, according to communists, is to enforce the rights of the bourgeoisie. So if there's no bourgeoisie, then there's no rights to enforce, and therefore people will just be happy ruling themselves. So that's the theory behind it. As we'll see later, there's good reasons why it doesn't really work. But for now, we can just say that what Marx predicted, well, first off, that the communist manifesto, or communism itself, was a response to the excesses of the industrial revolution, and that the way that it responded was that its prediction was that the industrial revolution would lead to so much social unrest that eventually the workers would overthrow the means of production, essentially the bourgeoisie. Right. Then their prediction was that communism wasn't something that might happen. It was something that would happen. It was inevitable. Right. And that when it was going to happen was when they actually wrote in 1848, and where it was going to happen was everywhere. Right? So the theory then was that the communist revolution was going to happen now, and it was going to happen everywhere. Okay? But now we have to ask ourselves, when did the communist revolution actually happen? Let me help you. Never. This worldwide revolution never happened, right? And so where did it happen? Nowhere. You guys get what I'm saying? So communism, when they predict that communist revolution is going to happen now and everywhere, but the communist revolution actually happens nowhere. And never and nowhere. That's a big problem in the theory, isn't it? And we'll talk more about that when we get into the 20th century, when the United States becomes officially kind of anti communist. Right? Okay. But anyway, communism is not going to be seen as a good solution for Americans because why? What happens to property in a communist system? You don't own any, right? Well, you do, actually. Everybody owns everything in common, right? So really, the idea behind communism is that rather than having private property ownership, that everybody would own everything in common, and that those people who had more would give voluntarily things to people who had less, so that everybody had enough. Right? So the problem with that then, is that sharing only seems like a good idea when you don't have anything, right? Let's say that you have a car and I don't have a car, then I think you should lend me your car. But if I have a car and you don't have a car, I think you should get your own car. You see what to share? We like to share things when we don't have anything, but when we have things we want to hold on to. So what we'll see happen is that communism will become popular in many places in Europe and other places in the world later, but not in the United States. And the reason why is because in the United States, people, even people who don't have property, believe that they can get it, that the United States is a land of opportunity, right? And all I need is my big break, or all I need to do is work a little harder or whatever, right? So there was a canadian scholar who commented on why communism never took off in the United States is because America doesn't have any poor people. We only have temporarily displaced millionaires, right? And at some point, we're all going to get rich. And that idea is what keeps us from adopting a concept of sharing everything. Because even though I don't have anything now, I might have something someday, and I don't want to have to share it with you. You see what I'm saying? So Americans don't like communism because Americans like stuff. We all have stuff, and we all want more stuff, and we want to hold on to our stuff. You follow what I'm saying? America, communism. It's not to say there never were communists in America. There were. Right. But in the big picture, communism was never a popular idea in the United States. Never has been. All right, so the next one is social Darwinism. Social Darwinism comes from Darwin's. Well, the idea of Darwinism. Let's talk about that. First. Darwin wrote a book in, he published in 1856 called the Origin of the Species. And in that book, he theorized that. Well, what was Darwin's theory? If you could sum up Darwin's theory in one sentence, what would it be? Survival of the fittest. Great. I'm glad you said that, because that's what we attribute to him, but that's not what he actually wrote. His purpose, essentially, was to argue in favor of the idea of evolution in the natural world. So it was more kind of scientific than it was social. But it was also from this rational point of view, right. Because up until this time, Christians had believed that everything that God created had existed from the very beginning and still existed, right. And it was unchanging. But what Darwin noticed when he started studying the fossil record in Argentina and then later in the Pacific islands is that over time, that there was evidence of creatures that once existed that no longer exist, right? And so his theory, first off, that counters the christian view that everything that exists always has existed, right? But his theory was that there were times when there was a change in environment that caused a crisis in the biological community, where some of the organisms adapted to the new environment and the rest of them couldn't adapt and they died out. Okay. That's where we get the idea of the survival of the fittest, because we assume that those organisms that survived were the fittest and the ones that didn't survive were not. But that's not what Darwin theorized. What Darwin theorized was that it was essentially random how some organisms survived and some didn't. He called it random selection. Right. But what we're going to see happen is that it's going to be a later group of people who will take the theories of Darwin and apply them to. So in Darwin, we could see maybe that the experiment would be that there were people in society or countries in the world. And we're going to see both of these this weekend, next week, too. Right. But today we'll think about people in society, that some people were able, that there was a change in environment. And the environment change was a change from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing economy, and that it created stresses on the social structure where some people were able to adapt and thrive in the new industrial environment. And some people could not adapt and they would not be able to survive. So according to the social Darwinist, all the stresses that are being caused by the industrial revolution are stresses that are natural and that people that are strong be able to adapt and survive. And those people who are suffering now, we should just let them die. Because if they die, then the ones that are left over are stronger. Right. So this process of evolution and letting the weak people die means that the society that emerges will be stronger because the weak people aren't there anymore. Right. So that's the essence of social Darwinism. When we look at it in the big picture, then how does it solve the problem? The way that it solves the problem is that it gets rid of all the people that are experiencing problems. They just die out. Right. And because of that, everybody that's left over is strong enough and they'll be able to survive and there won't be any social upheaval. All right, you guys get what I'm saying here? Okay, so it was actually the social Darwinist that came up with this idea of survival of the fittest. And then later Darwin went back and rewrote his book to include survival of the fittest in there. All right, what is the problem with the idea of social Darwinism? I mean, other than the fact that it's a monstrous ideology that you should just let suffering people die so that weaken society? Let's say one of the weaker members of society, as somebody who can't make a living in this new industrial society, right. Meaning they can't get food and they can't pay the rent and that sort of thing, what are those people going to do when they're suffering? Are they just going to lay down in the street and say, well, that's it, I'm done for, or what do you think they would do? What would you do? I'm sorry. Riot. Yeah, exactly. You would cause upheaval. Right. So the reality of social Darwinism is that in theory. Well, the theory of social Darwinism is that the weaker section will just die out. The reality of it is that they won't die out quietly, but they'll create a lot more upheaval in the meantime. And so then we may end up with creating the situation that makes marxist predictions. True. Right. So social Darwinism is, even though it was really adopted by a lot of intelligent people in the United States, it doesn't become something that Americans are very comfortable with. And I think that that idea is there for really two reasons. One is that moral reason that Americans don't look at people who are suffering, generally speaking, as a burden, but as people that need to be helped. And so there's that moral dimension, but there's also the practical dimension, which is that if you just let people suffer and don't do anything to stop it, it's going to get worse, it's not going to get better. Right. And then that could mean, for example, that I could lose all my stuff. Okay. Because there's a new class of people we talked about already, the middle class, the rise of the middle class. And this class is going to be really, you could kind of think about it as a managerial class, right? So as we industrialize, the corporations become less personal. They become kind of entities on their own that are made up of individuals. And the individuals that actually make those corporations work are the managers. Right. And so those people then will be the middle class. It will include the managerial class. It also will include, around this era, there were the formation of a lot of professional societies, like, for example, the American Medical association, the American Dental association, the American Historical association. Right? And these were what we would consider to be middle class interests forming their own interest groups. And this middle class is going to acquire property, right. It's not going to be a huge mansion on the cliffs in Rhode island, but it's going to be a little house in your neighborhood with a little lawn and a white picket fence and all that. Right? And so what that really means is that the middle class is now invested in the surplus that's being created by the industrial revolution and they want to keep it, right? And they are going to be afraid that if the social problems created by the industrial revolution aren't addressed, there's a real possibility they might lose all their stuff. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? So these are going to be the people then that are going to be pushing for reform and actually making reform happen. Okay? It actually comes from the middle. It doesn't come from the top, and it doesn't come from the bottle. Bottle. A lot of things come from the bottle, but not that, okay? It doesn't come from the bottom. It comes from the middle. We're going to talk about one other way of addressing social problems which you probably haven't heard of before, but if you think about it, you're really familiar with it, right? And that's positivism. Okay, so positivism is an idea that was thought up by this guy, August Komt. You may or may not have ever heard of him. He's the guy who theorized that you could consider society as a kind of a scientific environment, right? And that if you put people in society or you put countries in the society of nations, that those people could be managed scientifically. Right. His idea was that you could manage society scientifically into what we call modernization, which we talked about the other day, what that is, right. Industrialization and liberalism. But he was also the founder of the study of sociology. So if you ever had to take that class, this is the guy you're going to blame for it. Right? But at any rate, that idea that he had would be adopted. I'm going to give you a historical right, that idea that he had was adopted by. Right. Because in Mexico there was a great upheaval. Well, actually for a number of different years. But eventually what ended up happening was that the conflict situation in Mexico was resolved by the ascending to power of this handsome gentleman here, Pofidio Diaz, who was president of Mexico essentially for 40 years, okay? And the idea behind his idea, his strategy for rule, was that because Mexico was behind and was behind because of all the warfare that they'd fought. So it wasn't an industrialized, it wasn't a modernized country. And going with the formula that we talked about when we talked about on the first day, the formula was modernize or decolonized. Right. He and many other people in the world are working to try to modernize their society so that it doesn't become colonized. Right. And Mexico was under threat of colonization, at least on an economic level, which we'll talk about next, right. By the United States and by Britain and by France, Germany, right. All these different countries that are industrializing, that they see Mexico as ripe for exploitation because they have lots of resources and they're not modernized. You follow what I'm saying? So then the strategy was, well, we have to modernize society in order to be able to keep from being colonized. But we also know that industrialization leads to a lot of social upheaval. So what we're going to do is rather than just start to industrialize, we're going to manage that industrialization by scientists. And so when Pofrio Diaz comes to power in the 1880s, 1876, I think. But anyway, the point here is that the group of people that he appoints to run the nation and to modernize the nation are called scientificos, scientists, right? So the idea then is that they're going to apply these scientific principles to mexican society and economy in order to bring Mexico into modernization so that they will be among the industrial powers rather than among the colonized powers. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay. Well, that actually didn't really work out for a number of different reasons. And we'll talk some a little bit later. But these ideas are going to be popular in many other places, including the United States, right? The United States will, the progressives will look at the idea of positivism and say, well, this actually makes sense, right? That we should, rather than having everything run by money and power, we should actually scientifically control society so that we can overcome these social problems, right? So the idea then is society can be scientifically managed to modernization. And Americans, some Americans, progressives will start to believe this, but there's a problem with it in the United States. And what is that? What's the problem with the idea that scientists should be running the country? How do you become a scientist? Can you be elected scientist? No. You go to school. Yeah. You have to be educated. Right? Okay. So then means then, if only the people that can be rulers are scientists, what does that tell us about the government? Is it a democratic government? No. Think about like, for example, in, let's say, San Diego. At San Diego at one point they had a mayor and a city council and they were all elected, right? And then all the departments were run by people that were put in place by the elected people, right? You guys get what I'm saying? And they were patronage jobs, meaning that they could change at any time and they didn't even have to have any experience. Right. So you could be chief of police and not even have ever known anything about police. Right. Or you might want to use the police to support your drug running operation or something like that. Right. So in California, this group of progressives, and it's not just here, but I mean, in many places as well, at the same time they're going to say, okay, well, instead of having that, what we're going to do is we'll have an elected mayor and a city council. But all of the departments will be run by people who are scientists. Right? Okay. So that means essentially that the police chief has to be somebody who's trained to be a police chief, not just a good friend of the mayor. Right. You follow what I'm saying here? Well, here's why that's a problem. And I'm not saying it's a problem. It works really well. Okay. But the problem from american point of view is that once that police chief has been put in power, you can't remove him. Right. He wasn't elected and he can't be voted out of office. So what does that tell us about the government? Is it a democratic government? No. But what is the foundation for America's sense of itself? What kind of a government do we have? Democracy. A democracy in theory, right. So that's why when Americans look at positivism, when they look at, like, for example, what happened in Mexico, they'll notice that positivism is inherently anti democratic, right. Because you can't be elected scientists. Okay, so then what happens is that American will take these ideas of positivism and they will essentially change the name and kind of change the theme a little bit and call it progressivism. Now the difference between positivism and progressivism is kind of twofold because in most places, like in Mexico, positivism wasn't something that the people chose. It was chosen by the leaders. Right? But in America, progressive reforms are enacted at the ballot box. All right, so the reforms that we see that came about in the last part of the 19th and early part of the 20th century, for example, in California, where they decided they were no longer going to have the old machine politics of the mayor and the city council, but they were going to actually enact, they were going to actually put in place civil service reforms. That was something that was voted on by the people. The people actually made that happen. Right. So it is democratic in a way, but then once those reforms are enacted, that's when it becomes not democratic. Right. Because once the police chief is the police chief. You can't get rid of him unless he does something wrong. You know what I'm saying? Questions, comments? You can't just get rid of him because you don't like him. Right. Okay. So at any rate, when we look at the reform era in the United States, the reforms are going to be more based on this last idea and not on the first idea. Right. Really, both of the first ideas are rejected by Americans because Americans are concerned about being able to keep their property. Okay. Basically, that's it. Right. But positivism, what it does is it allows people to maintain their property and enhances their ability to keep it because of the fact that it does do away with social upheaval. And we'll talk about that in a second."

","The way that a state is created. Let me just say it this way first, okay? It has to do with the Northwest ordinance. The Northwest ordinance was enacted before the constitution actually was written by Thomas Jefferson. Right. And the idea what the Northwest ordinance did was it established a method for adding new states. Okay? And so the way that a state would be added would be that Congress would create a territory like the Ohio territory or the Indiana territory, and then they would appoint a governor to the territory. And then after that, the. The population would grow in that territory until it reached a certain level, at which point they would come together and write a constitution and apply for admission to the union. And then the Congress would say, yes, you're a part of the union, or, no, you're not part of the union. Right? You guys are following me here. Any questions about how that happens? Okay? Now, the one thing is that at this time, when you apply for admission to the union, you have to apply to be either a free state or a slave state, because there were slave states, states where slavery was. Was practiced, and that was all in the south. Okay. Or what? Basically the orange. The orange territory here, right? Okay. Or you'd be a free state. Okay. The slave states are the free states. All right? And you would have to. If you were going to. If you were going to apply for admission to the union, you would have to say, do I want to be admitted as a slave state or a free state? Okay? But now here's the situation, is that, as I mentioned to you, the free states have control of Congress, or at least part of Congress, because of the population. But do they have control of all of Congress? How can the south maintain their. Their significance in the congress? In the Senate. In the Senate, because the Senate grants equal representation to the states, right? So every state has two senators. So we could say, well, maybe New York has 30 representatives, but they only have two senators. You see what I'm saying? And maybe South Carolina has only got ten representatives, but they say they have the same number of senators. Two senators. Right? So the equality of the number of senators from free states and slave states is called parity. P a r I t y. Parity. Okay? And what the south wanted to do was to either increase the number of representative. Number of senators that they had over the number of free state senators, or at least maintain an equality, right? At least maintain parity. Because as long as they maintain parity, they had some influence over the. Over the federal government. You guys follow what I'm saying here? Questions, comments about this? All right? So when Missouri was when the Missouri applied for admission to the union, they applied for admission as a slave state. Okay? And that's. That's going to cause kind of a political crisis in Congress, because the voices of the antislave voices are really becoming louder and louder now. Abolitionism is becoming more and more important. And what ends up happening is that Congress denies Missouri's admission as a slave state. And this creates a crisis between the states because the southern states are going to say, well, if we're not going to. We can't even maintain parity in. In the Senate. We're not even going to be part of this. We're just going to leave the union. And so they come up with a compromise, the Missouri compromise. And the compromise is that Missouri will be admitted as a slave state and Maine will be admitted as a free state. Okay? Because Maine was. Before this, it was part of Massachusetts. So Maine becomes its own state and it's free state. And so what that does is it maintains parity. They have equal number of senators in the. In the south, in the slave states and free states. You guys are with me on this. Questions, comments? And then the final thing was that they drew a line, and the line was where the Missouri meets the Mississippi right here and going all the way west as far as it goes. Right all the way to the Pacific. And that line, the purpose of that line, the Missouri compromise line, is to state that no slave states can be admitted north of that line. Now, if that's true, and they did agree to that, how much territory is there for the. For the slave states to add to the union? If they want to grow their influence in the government, where can they do it? There's nowhere left for them to go, really. Exactly. Because this. This territory all belongs to, actually starts belonging to Spain and then belongs to Mexico. And all of the. All of the. Everything south of this belongs to the Spain. In fact, there's going to be a group of people from the south who are going to attempt to annex different places in Spanish America, among them Cuba, Brazil, and Nicaragua, for the purposes of creating new states. All right. They're not going to be successful. But at any rate, the point is that the compromise is a kind of a bitter concession on the part of the south, but they do remain in the union. So the Missouri compromise passes and the union survives. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. We're going to come back to this later. So I hope you guys remember what I just said. I just want to spend a couple minutes summarizing the Missouri compromise. The Missouri compromise occurred in 1820 after Missouri applied for admission to the union. Missouri was denied admission to the union as a slave state, at which point there was a crisis in which the southern states threatened to secede, and so there was a compromise that was made to save the union. The compromise was that Missouri was admitted as a slave state. Maine was admitted as a free state so that they could maintain parity, and then there was an agreement that parity would be maintained in adding new states afterwards. And then there was a limit on the extension of slave territory above the Missouri compromise line, which was a line that was essentially where the Ohio river meets the Mississippi river and going all the way west. So you can see on this little map that I'm showing you here, the Green Line is the Missouri compromise line, which turns out to be a bitter concession on the part of the southerners, because, in reality, there was no territory left south of that line that the south could organize into territories for expansion of slave influence on the national government."

","These oppressions are being felt throughout the colonies. But the distance between the colonies is so great that it's hard for people in Massachusetts to know what people in Georgia are up to or doing or how they're experiencing. So what happens is that all of the assemblies of the american colonies, even the one in Massachusetts, have been outlawed. Right? Form what they call committees of correspondence. And what these committees do is they write letters to the other assemblies to try to devise a common response to what they consider to be british oppression. And they finally realize that they're not getting anywhere because it's just taking so much time and it's so burdensome. And so what they decide to do is to call a congress. And we call that the first continental Congress, which is called in Philadelphia in 1774. When they come together, what we're going to see, and this is a common theme in american politics, starting really even before the revolution and going all the way up until today. And that is that there are always two voices in american politics. All right? So in the first Continental Congress, we have two different groups, and the two different groups are called the radicals and the conservatives. Okay? Radicals would be people like, at this point, you could say John Adams and Sam Adams and people like that who want to break away from England, who think that the United States should be independent or the colony should be independent, and the conservatives, who are saying, no, we should find some way to find common ground with the parliament so that we can stay part of the empire. In fact, the idea of leaving the empire is almost unthinkable. Right? So the result of this is that this divide will end up with creating two different responses on the part of the american colonies or on the part of the Congress, right? And one of them is going to be the Suffolk resolves, which is the platform of the radicals, and the other one will be a declaration of rights, which is the platform of the conservatives. Right? So let's talk first about the Suffolk resolves. And I'm going to show you a lot of things here. You don't need to write all these down, but let's just think about what they tell us. All right, first off, what are the Suffolk resolves? Suffolk is the county in Massachusetts where Boston is. And what happened after the coercive acts was that the local representatives came together and published a set of resolves in response to the coercive acts or the intolerable acts. Right? So this is actually something that the county that Boston is in has done. Okay. And what they did was they denounced the intolerable acts. They decide to boycott british imports, not export anything, refuse to use british products, pay no obedience to the Massachusetts government Act, which means that they'd taken away the right of the assembly or the Boston port bill, which closed the port. Right. So they're going to pay no obedience to that. They're going to demand resignation from those appointed to that, to the new government, refuse to pay taxes, support a colonial government in Massachusetts free of royal authority, and urge the colonies to raise militia of their own people. All right. Okay. So now let's think about this for a second. If you were going to sum all this up, what do the Suffolk resolve say to the British? Saying, yeah, we totally believe that the british government is legitimate and we're going to follow the law? No, this is basically the start of the revolution, you could say. Exactly. This is a revolutionary act. Right. So the revolution in ideas has already started. And then when we see the Continental Congress adopt the Suffolk resolves, what that's saying is that the american colonies are not going to acknowledge royal authority until these acts are repealed. So, in essence, the american revolution has already begun because Americans have said, we're not going to follow the law. All right, you guys, follow me here. Questions? Comments? Okay, so then the other thing that they do is they pass a Declaration of Rights, basically saying that we are being oppressed by the parliament and we have rights that the parliament shouldn't be able to curtail, but we're still loyal to the king. Right? So the idea here is that, again, as I showed you that kind of little diagram of the empire on Monday, that the Americans don't think that they owe any kind of allegiance to the parliament, only to the king. Right. And that's what they're saying here. And their idea is, well, if the king really knew what the parliament was doing, he wouldn't let it. But the king obviously did know everything about what the parliament was doing. Right? So, at any rate, this is going to be the more conservative response of the Congress. So we have a radical response and a conservative response. And then when parliament learns about all of this, they say, okay, well, you guys can't rule yourselves anymore, and they outlaw all of the local assemblies. All right, so from this point on, we really have two competing governments in America. There's the local assemblies, who don't actually dismantle. Right. And then there's the royal authorities that are appointed to try to bring the colonists back into line. Okay, you guys follow comments? Okay, so now, remember, the last thing that was in the Suffolk resolves said that they were going. Let's take a look here. The last thing was urge the colonies to raise militia. Okay, so the idea then, of the militia is what? The idea of the militia is we need to defend ourselves against the British. And the way that we're going to do it is we're going to arm the citizens and we're going to train to oppose oppression. So when they start training, they're militias. Okay, questions? Comments? All right, so now you guys have heard the shot heard around the world, and this is an interesting episode. Okay, so this is George Washington getting ready to fly to secure the airports. This was in response to Donald Trump's 4 July address where he said that the american revolutionary secured the airports. Right? So this is them going to secure the airports. It's a joke. Okay. But what really happened here was that the royal government in Boston finds out that the militia has not only been training, but they have a cache of weapons in Concord. This is about 10 miles. Okay. So what the governor in Boston says is that he sends soldiers to capture the arms in Concord to take them away from the militia, essentially to dismantle, to disarm the colonists. Right? Okay, so you guys know about the poem the midnight ride of Paul Revere. One if by land, two if by sea, whatever. Right? The idea here, though, is that as the British start to march toward conquered, the militia starts to form up. And by the time that they're formed up, they're here in Lexington. Okay, so Lexington is just a little, tiny village, and it's got a big square in the middle of it that they call the green. Right? Lexington Green. Okay. And what happens is that the militias formed up in the road on the Lexington green, and the british troops march into the village, and then they face off. Right? And what happens then is that the british commander orders the militia to disperse. And they actually do start to disperse, but in the middle of it, somebody fires a shot. And as it is with these historical things, nobody knows who fired the shot. We don't know if it was british for the american, but what we do know is that they started fighting each other. Okay? And the British actually are going to get the worst of it. And the reason why is because of the way the British fight. So the way the British fight is that they form two lines, and then when one line is standing and firing, the other line is on their knees and reloading. All right? This is the way european warfare is done at this time. And their expectation is that the other side will do the same thing. So we have these two lines up and down, firing at each other. And whoever wins the battle is whoever's still standing at the end. Right? So that's the way the British expected the Americans to fight. Okay. But now I want you to remember back a couple of weeks ago when we talked about King Philip's war. Do you remember that? King Philip's war. And how did the. The Indians fight that caused so much trouble for the British, for the colonists, it was because they hid behind rocks and trees and things like that, right. And they didn't fight by the rules. And that's what we see happening here. Americans have adopted that style of fighting, right? So Americans are fighting what they call indian style, and the British think that's not fair, but they don't know how to respond to it. You follow what I'm saying? And that's why the British actually take a lot of casualties in this battle. Nevertheless, they are able to make it to Concord, and they do get the arms and they go back to Boston. But it creates a sense that maybe the Americans could actually beat the British with just a militia. Okay? And by the way, these militia were trained to be called up on a minute's notice. So the militia ends up being called, what? Minutemen. Minutemen, exactly. All right. Okay. Now I want us to take another step back here, and I want us to think about what we just witnessed. And what we witnessed was a powerful central authority face who's trying to exert oppressive power over the people. And one of the ways that they want to do that is by disarming them. Okay? And this is going to be something that Americans remember. Americans remember that there was this powerful central government that tried to take away their ability to enforce their rights. And so when the Bill of Rights is being written later, they will remember this. And one of the amendments that they'll put into the constitution, the Second Amendment, it actually was the third at the time, but it's the second amendment now. Okay? One of the amendments that they'll put into the Constitution is a check on the power of the central government to disarm the states, okay? So the purpose of the second amendment was to prevent something like this from happening, to prevent the central government from being able to disarm the states, okay? So that was the purpose of the Second Amendment, and that was the way that it was actually interpreted all the way up until 2010. Right? In 2010, Supreme Court magically found an individual right to gun ownership. Right? And that's what the NRA and that crowd says about gun ownership now, is that you have a constitutional, God given right to own guns. That's not what the Second Amendment was for. That's the way it is interpreted now. But even that has a limit on it. So if you look at the actual Supreme Court ruling, it will, you will notice that even if there is an individual right, the right is not unlimited. And it talks about different ways that the states have a right and a responsibility to limit, to restrict gun ownership for public safety. All right. Anyways, you can go back and look at that later if you want."

","This is going to be another instance of when the southern states are going to threaten to secede from the union. Okay. Because they're going to say, well, let's. Let's go back and remember, why is it that the slave states were so adamant about adding new slave states? Why did the south. Because it helped them. It helped them politically and also economically. Well, politically is mostly the thing. Right. You're right. The idea here is that if you add new states, then you add new representatives and you add new senators. Right. And remember that one of the outcomes of the Missouri compromise was what was called parity. P a r I t y. What is parity? I might be a tad bit wrong, but isn't it like, kind of like the idea that, you know, they wanted some. The same representation that the non slave states were getting in the government. Right. Exactly. You're absolutely right. What part of the government did the south have? Have parity in legislative. Right. Which part of the legislative delegates. Almost. Try it again. Senators. Right. Because remember, they have an equal number of representatives from. In the Senate from each state, but a different number of representatives. Right. And the problem that the south had was that the population of the north was growing and the population of the south was stagnant. So that meant that the north was getting more and more representation in the House, but they could maintain parity in the Senate. Right. It's kind of like the Senate the way it is today. Right. With even split between the number of senators. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right. Okay. So now the idea then, that slavery can't advance into this new territory is going to break the government and the south is going to threaten to secede. So a number of people come together and they work on a compromise. And I want to talk about the four different approaches to solving the problem that were evident in this. In this compromise that came about as a result of the Wilmot proviso. And the first, there's basically four different people in american government at the time. All right. So Henry Clay, who was from Kentucky, said that what was really important was the union, and that in order to save the union, if you had to allow the expansion of slavery, that was fine. Okay. So Henry Clay said, we don't care if slavery expands or maybe we don't like it, but we think that the saving the union is more important, and so we should compromise on that issue. That's going to be one point of view. Okay, guys, with me, the next one, John Calhoun. We've already heard of John Calhoun. Before. Right. What do we know from John about John Calhoun? He thought that bringing in the Mexicans would ruin everything and weaken the United States. Okay. That's true. Okay. That is the last time we heard about him. We also heard about him when he was talking about how after South Carolina had passed its nullification, ordinance of nullification, that the south could see from the union if the union was imposing policies that were bad for the state or they wouldn't have to follow it. So that was back in the 1830s. And what we said was that John Calhoun, who was from. Does anybody remember what state he was from? Because I said this state that he was from was the kind of poster child for the white supremacist secessionist outlook of the South. South Carolina. Exactly. South Carolina. So John Calhoun is right there on the screen from South Carolina. Right. And he says that the issue of slavery is states rights, and that if basically the way that the people in the south think about this or not everybody but most people, many people think about this, is that the issue of slavery isn't an issue of morality. It's an issue of property. Okay. And if we'll recall going back to the american revolution, what is the purpose of government? To protect property. Property. Exactly. So when we read Locke, Locke said that if the government. If the purpose of government is to protect property and the government doesn't protect your property, but instead takes it away from you, what should you do? Rebel. Rebel. You should get rid of that government and establish a new government. And that was the. The justification for the american revolution. That's what we read about in the Declaration of Independence. Right. You guys are all with me. Okay, so what. What John Calhoun and the people of south are saying, that slaves are not people. Slaves are property. And that if the federal government is trying to limit our ability to own property or to take our property away from us, then we have a right to change the government. And the precedent was the american revolution. You guys follow what I'm saying here? This makes sense to you guys. So then, from Calhoun's point of view, there can be no compromise on the issue of slavery. And here's one place where he said it. It was in the Senate. Right. The south has no compromise to offer but the constitution and no concession or surrender to make. She has already surrendered so much that she has little left to surrender. Such a settlement would go, the settlement says, allowing slave states. Right. Such a settlement would go to the root of the evil and remove all cause of discontent. By satisfying the south that she could remain honorably and safely in the union by abandoning any limit or any attempt to limit or restrict slavery, and thereby restore the harmony and fraternal feelings between the sections which existed anterior to the Missouri agitation, which is Missouri compromise. Nothing else can with any certainty, finally and forever settle the question at issue. Terminate agitation, which means the threat to terminate slaver, to end slavery or abolish slavery or limit slavery and save the union. Okay, so this is part of that debate that we're talking about in 1850. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions, comments about this. All right, so now let's go back and what was Henry Clay's idea? How should we solve the problem? Compromise. Compromise. What is John Calhoun's solution? No. Compromise. Don't compromise. Exactly. Now, there's another guy, Daniel Webster, who's from Massachusetts, and he's going to say it's very important to save the union, and that the way to do that is not to legislate on slavery. Let. Let slavery go wherever it will, because it won't go everywhere. Right. So, for example, if you think about the purpose, the use of slavery in the south, what was slavery used for? Plantations. Plantations. Exactly. So now, how many plantations, how many cotton plantations do you think they're going to set up in the California mountains or in the Arizona desert? They're not, right? So what Webster says is, well, where the places where it could go, it might go, but where it can't go, it won't go. There's a natural limit to where slavery will be useful. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? So that's his input, I guess, to the conversation. And then the last guy you may have heard of, Stephen Douglas, senator from Illinois, he had you. You may. Where you had heard of him before was from the Lincoln Douglas debates. He had a famous series of debates with Abraham Lincoln, but his idea is popular sovereignty. Okay, so popular sovereignty means let the people decide. Okay, so if we make a new territory, and the people that move into the territory apply for statehood as a slave state, then if they chose that, we should allow that. Right? This is the most american point of view. The most american point of view is let the people decide. If they want slavery, that's fine. If they don't want slavery, that's fine, too. You guys get what I'm saying? It seems like the most american point of view. The problem, we're going to see what the problem is in a few minutes. But now let's look at how they finally compromised is called the compromise of 1850. Why do you think they call it the compromise of 1850? Because it happened in 1850. Because it happened in 1850. Good. All right. So now here's what they call the compromise is the compromise is there's a new fugitive slave law. Now. Let me just talk briefly about the fugitive slave law. The fugitive slave law was a law that made it illegal to assist a slave who had escaped from their master in the south, right? So now the way that it was viewed by the south was that slaves were property and that if somebody helped a slave escape, that was assisting in grand theft. Okay? Keeping in mind that the price of a slave was equivalent to what we would think of as the price of a car today, right? So what they're saying is that, well, this slave is my property, and if you try to help my property to escape, which is kind of odd for us to think about it, the car tries to escape by itself because you're a bad driver. Right. And somebody helps the car, somebody drives it, let's say, right, then you're assisting in grand theft. That makes sense to you guys? So that's the way the south looked at it. The north. Many people in the north. Now, not a lot, not everybody, but a lot of people in the north are starting to think of slavery as a moral evil, right? And so there is no compromise on a moral evil. But if we're thinking about slaves as property, then we have to say, well, okay, that if somebody helps my property to escape, then they should be prosecuted. That's what the fugitive slave law was. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? And they had had one before, but it wasn't really enforced very well. So the southern states were demanding that the north enforce this law vigorously. Okay, you guys with me? Questions? Comments? All right, so that's one. Ask one. One of the issues of the compromise, the next one. California is admitted as a free state. California had already formed a government and asked for admission as a free state, but its admission to the union was actually held up by this debate over the inclusion of the territory. But California then is admitted as a free state. And New Mexico and Utah, these two territories here, are to be admitted by popular sovereignty. What does that mean again? They get to popular vote, right? Let the people decide. Okay. And then they fixed the western boundary of Texas. If you guys remember the map that I showed you last week, Texas believed that their territory went all the way up into here, but the Congress fixed the western boundary of Texas to where it is today, which is basically where Mexico had fixed the boundary between Texas and New Mexico. Right? And then. And then they abolished the slave trade in Washington DC, but not slavery, which means that you can own a slave in Washington DC, but you can't buy and sell slaves in Washington DC. Okay, you guys are with me. So that's their compromise. And the compromise actually works to keep the union together for another ten years or so."

","This week, we're going to start looking at the British Empire in North America, beginning with Virginia and New England. Today we'll focus on Virginia, and in the next segment, we'll turn our attention to New England. Before we do that, we need to finish the english history timeline we started last week, which will bring us pretty close to the end of the colonial period. In the previous discussion of the timeline, we ended with the English Civil War and the execution of Charles I. That conflict lasted from 1643 to 1649 and raised a critical question. Who should have the power to rule, the king or parliament? The Reformation saw England breaking away from the Catholic Church, which created a split between Protestants, particularly Anglicans and Catholics. Henry VI's break with the Catholic Church wasn't about religious beliefs. It was because he wanted a divorce. This sparked the English Reformation, which was more about political power and money than religious differences. Depending on who was king or Queen, England would swing between Protestantism and Catholicism. The reformation in Europe had set in motion religious wars between Protestants and Catholics. This religious tension played a role in leading to the English Civil war. Charles I leaned toward Catholicism and supported catholic efforts on the continent. By this time, most people were protestant and saw the Catholic Church as a great evil. When Charles ran out of his own money to support catholic causes, he was refused by parliament, which was opposed to spending money fighting against other Protestants. They also believed that the right to govern came from the people and not through divine right. When the king tried to suspend parliament and raise taxes on his own, England was torn by civil war between the king and parliament. The civil war ended with the execution of King Charles I, and the monarchy was replaced by the Commonwealth, which turned out to be quite strict. Under Oliver Cromwell, it was not a democracy. It was more like a religious dictatorship, with the government enforcing a strict religious regime. People were fined or publicly humiliated for not attending church. Shakespeare's plays were forbidden in London, what the Puritans regarded as sin, drinking, gambling, revelry, was illegal. In the end, people weren't happy with this regime, and after Cromwell died, the monarchy was brought back with Charles II. This period is known as the Restoration. In America, places like North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia are known as restoration colonies. Charleston got its name from Charles II. Charles was succeeded by James II, the Duke of York, who ruled New York for a time and after whom New York is named. James was an unpopular authoritarian who tried to assert divine right, which led to his daughter Mary and her husband, William of Orange, raising an army in 1688, which was sent to England to depose the king. This event is called the glorious revolution. It is called glorious because it was a bloodless coup. But James in exile did not relinquish his claim to the throne and set in motion decades of political turmoil in England. After William and Mary were placed on the throne by parliament, the question of who rules England was resolved. It was parliament, with the monarch reigning at the pleasure theoretically of the people, a constitutional monarchy. The political turmoil of the 18th century distracted british rule over the colonies. The period is called the era of benign or salutary neglect. The result in America was that the colonies were left to rule themselves, even though parliament still claimed sovereignty over the colonies. The effect of this will be significant when we come to the causes of the american revolution. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas. If you have any questions, you can post them in the open forum discussion or contact the professor using canvas. Email."

","Today we're going to start talking about the Cold War, and we're going to actually divide it into two different pieces. The first part will be about basically going up to the end of the Korean War, and then the next part will be about mostly the Vietnam war. Okay? So that's where we're gonna go. And then after that, we'll talk about civil rights. The first thing we want to think about a couple things, really. The first one is that we think of the Cold War as something that was a very dangerous and kind of anxious period of time, but it wasn't really a serious conflict. But that is wrong. There was a lot of. There was a lot of shooting and killing going on in the Cold War. It's just. The reason why they call it a cold war is because the United States and the Soviet Union never actually got to the point of conflict, although they were closed a couple times. But instead, what happened was that the Soviets and the United States fought wars through proxies. So there were wars in Central Asia, and there were wars in Southeast Asia, and there were wars in Spanish America, where the United States and the Soviets fought through proxies. And there were a lot of people that were killed in those conflicts. But the reason why we call it cold again is because the United States and the Soviets didn't actually engage in direct conflict with each other. Okay. And the reason for that was because it was too dangerous. It had become too dangerous. And we'll hopefully see kind of how that works here in. In the next couple of lectures. Okay, so, well, where. Where does the Cold War start? And the next thing is that we generally think of the Cold War as really coming right out of world War two, meaning that the Cold War, we can pinpoint the time when the United States and the Soviet Union and their allies stopped cooperating against the Germans and the Japanese and set out on their own, kind, of course, with their own strategy. And that was right after the surrender of Germany. There was a conference at a place called Potsdam. Potsdam was the. The palace of the Kaiser in Berlin. And there was a conference between the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain over the post war security arrangement. And it was at this conference that the Soviets stopped cooperating with the west. Okay. The reason why we won't. I mean, that's when we say that the cold war actually started. But in reality, the cold war started much earlier, and it really started during the russian revolution, which we talked about briefly when we talked about World War one. And one of the outcomes of the russian revolution was the establishment of the soviet state. And the soviet state was driven by the idea of a communist revolution. If you guys, we've talked briefly about the strategy of communism, the marxist strategy, which was that there would be a spontaneous revolution of the working classes who would rise up and overthrow the bourgeoisie, and then they would establish, essentially a workers paradise. That never happened. And over time, marxist thinkers tried to theorize why, even though Marx's prediction didn't come true, how he was still right. And one of the ways that they did that was by saying that the. The revolution wasn't going to be spontaneous, that it had to be led. And so there was a. There was a vanguard of the revolution, intellectual vanguard, and this idea was taken up by Vladimir Lenin. Vladimir Lenin was one of the, I guess you could say, founders of the soviet state. And his idea was that the revolution had to be led, but the marxist theory was that once the revolution had started, then it would spread everywhere. So Marx had said that the revolution, when he wrote in 1848, from his point of view, the revolution is now, and it's going to end up everywhere. But in reality, the marxist revolution happened never and nowhere. All right? But when the Russians had their revolution and they established the soviet state, their idea was that they were the beginning of this worldwide communist revolution. And that from that point of view, they adopted a stated foreign policy of opposing capitalism, of spreading communism. The idea was that they were going to spread communism everywhere, that this communist revolution would happen everywhere, but it would happen. It had to be led, and it would be led by the Soviets. So this was. Goes back to 1920, 419 24 was when the soviet state was established. And they, they stated that their intention was to overthrow capitalism. And of course, with capitalism goes the idea of liberalism, the idea of democracy, and those things that we tend to believe in here in the west, that's where the Cold War started. There was really no. There was really no. There was no way to compromise between capitalism and communism, because communism, the theory behind communism was that it couldn't be successful anywhere unless it was successful everywhere. All right? So even though they established a communist state in the Soviet Union, from their point of view, the revolution had to continue until communism was established everywhere. And that meant the overthrow of the United States and Britain and all the western democracies. You guys are following me here. And so this is one of the reasons why after World War one, there was a big, what they call red scare, where people were afraid of the Soviets, they were afraid that the communists were coming, the Reds are coming, and they're going to take over the country. And that kind of subsided, but it didn't really end. And when the United States allied with the Soviet Union, that alliance was an alliance of convenience. The alliance was that both sides had a greater enemy. And so I think that the best way that you could describe the alliance was the way that Winston Churchill described it when he said that if Hitler invaded, hell, he would be allied with satan. Okay? It was an alliance that was meant to oppose Germany, but once the Germans had been defeated, there was nothing to hold the alliance together. Okay? And so then what happens is that they come together at this conference at Potsdam in Germany, and the idea then is that they're going to establish a security system for Europe after World War two, but the Soviets withdraw. They refuse to compromise. And the reason why is because from their point of view, they can't compromise with the west because it's capitalist. And so instead, they established their own zone of control in eastern Europe. And when we look at this map here, you can see that basically the line between what's purple and what's not purple is what we will eventually end up calling the Iron Curtain. Okay? And the idea is that Germany, basically, where this line is, is where the soviet troops had stopped at the end of the war. So they continued to control all the territory that they had occupied during the war, and they established puppet states, basically, that were. Had allegiance to, were dominated by the Soviet Union, including Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and all these other states here. Okay? All right. So that's when we see the rhetorical beginning of the Cold War is right after the war. Winston Churchill, who's no longer prime minister of England, comes to America to deliver a speech in Missouri with President Truman sitting on the stage with him, and he declares that an iron curtain has fallen across the continent of Europe. And that's basically that line that I showed you. Okay. And this is where we see the United States start to develop its opposition to soviet expansion. So now the Americans were kind of taken aback. The Americans, I'd have to say, were. Were a little naive. And not just the Americans. I mean, Winston Churchill at one point thought that he could recruit Joseph Stalin to be part of the democratic club, but the Americans thought that since the United States and the Soviets had been allies in world War two, that they would continue to have friendly relations after World War two. And so they were kind of taken aback about why they saw this opposition coming from the Soviet Union. And so there was a diplomat who had been stationed in Moscow for a long period of time. He wasn't the ambassador. He was a career diplomat. And they asked this him, he was an expert on soviet policy, and they asked him to explain why the Soviets were behaving the way that they were. And he responded with an 8000 word telegram, which ended up being called the long telegram. Does anybody want to guess why it was called the long telegram? It was 8000 words. Yeah, because it was long. Okay, so at any rate, in this telegram, he describes soviet strategy in Europe. Okay? So let's just take a look at the strategy here that the soviet policy is motivated by european political history. Okay? So the Soviets, basically, their interest is they want to protect themselves from Germany because they've been invaded by Germany twice in the same century. And they also want to be able to control. Sorry, this area here, because it's really the only warm water port that the Soviets have, is here in the Crimean peninsula. Right? So they're interested in controlling this area because they were strangled. This is what had caused them to be knocked out of the war in world War one. So they wanted to control this area and they wanted to establish a buffer between, particularly Germany and the Soviet Union. All right? So that's the kind of european historical part of their strategy. The other part of the strategy was that, again, they wanted to expand communism everywhere. Right? So they wanted to expand communism into western Europe, and they would do it either by elections or by force, essentially. Right. Okay. And we'll talk more about that in just a second. But the point here is that the Soviets then are not interested in peaceful coexistence again, because communism can't work anywhere unless it works everywhere, and they are determined to advance socialism. What Kennan argued was that the way to counter soviet strategy was what was called containment. And basically the idea of containment thinks of communism as a. As a kind of a cancer, right? And it's a cancer that's inoperable. You can't cut it out because the Soviet Union was too powerful to confront militarily, but you could keep it from spreading. And so his idea then was not to confront communism, but to keep it from spreading. And that's going to be the strategy that the west will adopt, and we'll talk about that in just a couple minutes. Right. The other kind of thing here is that the soviet power was impervious to the logic of reason. It's highly sensitive to the logic of force. And one of the things that Kennan noted was that if the Soviets were met with strong resistance, then they would back down. So what he suggested was a policy that comes to be known as brinksmanship, meaning that if the Soviets. How should I say this? If the Soviets. If the Soviets make an advance, an aggressive advance, and their advance is met by the same amount of aggression, then that eventually they will back down. So the idea of brinksmanship then is that both sides continue to advance aggression until it reaches the brink of war. And then once you reach the brink of war, the Soviets will back down. Okay? So that's going to be part of the western strategy. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Now, here's the thing. The thing about the Kennan telegram was that it was intended to describe soviet policy in Europe. The way that the United States interpreted it was that this policy should be enforced everywhere. And so after World War two, we're going to see a movement towards socialism in. In many places in the world, which, again, we'll talk about that in just a few minutes. Much of it is not driven by the Soviets. Much of it is, although it is supported by the Soviets, much of it is actually driven by the fact that many of these countries that were formerly colonized now find themselves independent but poor. And so socialism, to them, looks like a good strategy. Right? And so what will happen is you'll see the Soviets, on the one hand, publicly stating that their strategy is to overthrow communism, excuse me, capitalism, and overthrow communism everywhere. Excuse me. To establish communism everywhere. And at the same time, we see countries like Southeast Asia and different countries in Africa and different countries in South America who are kind of playing dabbling, I guess you could say, with socialism. And the Americans are going to attribute it all to Moscow, right? So this phrase that I've put here, monolithic world communist movement based in Moscow, what this says is that wherever you see communism in the world, the Soviets are behind it. It's not true. But this is the way the Americans are going to approach the subject, and this is going to be. This is going to really lay the foundation for a lot of tragedy that's going to follow. Okay? Because, as I mentioned, there are places in the world where people are making a choice for socialism, but the Americans will not see that as a free choice. They'll see that as something that's being driven from Moscow, and so they will be opposed to it. And again, we'll see how that works here in the next couple of lectures."

","Today we're going to talk about, instead of the expansion of the franchise, we're going to talk about expansion of the geographical extent of the United States, and we're going to see how all of the territories, almost all of the territories west of Louisiana purchase, get added to the United States in a period of time and the creation of the border with Mexico. All right, questions, comments about any of this? All right, so let's talk about first manifest destiny. You guys have heard of manifest destiny before. What is it? Isn't it that the colonists kind of believed that it was like their divine right to that land? Okay, so that's. That's exactly what you guys mostly have been taught. We're not really talking about colonists now. We're talking about the Americans. Right, but the idea that we've been taught is that manifest destiny was the american people's God given right to control the north american continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. And that is actually what it comes to mean in a certain sense. But like everything else in american history, there's really two different applications, I guess you could say, of the. Of the term manifest destiny. All right, so on the one hand, there is that kind of economic aspect that we've talked about that says that all of this territory should be added to the United States. So that can add to the economic vitality of the United States. But the original idea of manifest destiny was actually an ideological thing. All right? And the way that we can understand this ideology is to think about the term temple of liberty. Okay? So the temple of liberty was a way that Americans described the federal system. The federalist system. Right. So now I'm going to actually invite another five minutes of silence by asking you, what is federalism? It's like how powers divided between a national government, for example. Like a state government. Exactly. So that's what we've been. One of the themes that we've had ever since the beginning was that there was. That there was a disconnect between, or a disconnect in the understanding of the powers of the federal government versus the state government. And that's the issue of federalism. Right, but the idea behind federalism is that you have a national government that does all of the things that the state governments can't do, and then everything that the state governments can do, they do. All right, so the federalist system in the United States is set up in such a way that the states are considered to be individual countries, and they have all the rights and privileges of a country except for those that can't be accomplished along with the other states. So the. Well, the way that a state would get added to the federal government, we've talked about this before, having to do with the Northwest ordinance, is that the national government, the Congress, creates a territory, and people move into the territory. And then once enough people are in the territory, they convene a convention. The. They create a government and write a constitution, and then they apply for admission to the union, in this case, either as slave or free. Okay, so the idea then is that states can be added to the union, but before they can be added to the union, they have to be ready. And how states can be added to the union, how they can be ready is by being democratic, by having a democratic government, by having a liberal, what we call classically liberal government or a government under a constitution. So the United States can add new countries, but every country that's added has to be a constitutional gov. Has to have a constitutional government. You can't add a monarchy or a theocracy that can't be part of the United States, because the United States is. Is a. Is a almost, I guess you could say confederation or union of individual countries that are all democratic. All right, you guys get what I'm saying? So that aspect of the american system that every state has to be democratic is described by earlier by Americans during the period we're talking about as the temple of liberty, because every state that's added to the United States has to have or demonstrate or practice what we have called liberty. Okay. And if. I hate to do this, but we go all the way back to the very beginning of the course, and we talk about what is liberty. Remember, liberty with an exclamation point is democracy, secularism, capitalism, the government style of the United States called classical liberalism. All right, you guys are all with me on this. Questions? Comments? So what characterizes all of the states together is liberty. And. And the way that a state can be added to the union is by being. By. By practicing, by putting into practice the ideas of liberty. You guys get what I'm saying? So that means that the United States, according to the people who lived at the time, they view the United States as the temple of liberty. So now let's think for a minute about if. Let's say that. I mean, think about this is actually religious. They're thinking about this in religious terms. All right, so let's think about if there was a religion and they had a temple, and you were walking down the street one day and you look inside the temple and you see what's going on in there? You say, I think I'd like to be part of that. So how would that. How would you become a part of that temple? Well, you would go into the temple and you'd find out what they were doing and you'd figure out how to practice it. And then after some period of time, they'd ask you if you believed on all the things that they believed in, and you'd practice all the things that they practiced. And if you said yes, you'd be in. Right. But if you went in and said, I don't really believe any of this stuff, but I want to be part of it anyway, they wouldn't let you in. You get what I'm saying? And the other part of it is that they don't go out on the street and beat people over the head and drag them in. You see what I'm saying? It's voluntary. And not only is it voluntary, but you have to be ready. This is the way people thought about adding territories to the union, is that these territories can be added to the union, but they have to demonstrate liberty, right? They have to be ready. Okay. And, and so what that means, if you think about that, is that the original concept of manifest destiny is not an ideology of conquest. It's not the idea that it's just out there and you can take it. It means that that territory can be added, but only when it's ready. Okay, you guys follow I'm saying here? So now let's think about that in terms. Let me just. I don't remember what I wrote here. Yeah. So, so what we see here then is the two kind of understandings of manifest destiny around the period of time that we're talking about. The first one, this, this article in United States magazine Democratic Review, is the first time that the words manifest destiny are actually appear in print. And there, John L. O'Sullivan describes manifest destiny, America's manifest destiny, to overspread the continent. By the, by the way that I just talked about, the advance guard, irresistible army of anglo saxon immigration armed with a plow on the rifle, markings trail with schools and colleges, courts and representatives, halls, mills and meeting houses. All of this means that they are getting ready. They are becoming ready. Okay. And what's being talked about here is the annexation of Texas, which we're going to talk about in just a couple of minutes, right. Because people are saying that Texas, when Texas was originally applied for statehood, they were denied. And now John L. O'Sullivan is saying they are ready. And how can they be ready? What do they have to demonstrate to be ready to be part of the United States? Liberty. Liberty, exactly. All right. Now, on the other hand, and this happens during the mexican american war, which is another thing going to talk about in just a couple minutes, is this senator William Gilpin, who said, who described manifest destiny this way, the untransacted destiny of the american people is to subdue the continent, to rush over this vast field to the Pacific Ocean. Divine task, immortal mission. Let us trade fast and joyfully on the open trail before us, but every american heart open wide for patriotism to glow undimmed, to confide with religious faith in the sublime and prodigious destiny of his well loved country. All right, so that doesn't sound like the kind of more cautious approach that manifest destiny originally had, but it sounds more like an ideology of conquest, doesn't it? It sounds more like the United States has been granted by God the destiny of subduing the north american continent. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So there's really two different definitions here. And the reason why I bring that up is because this fits with the american system, if you guys will remember, when we're going all the way back to the Washington administration, there are two very different visions of what kind of a country the United States is. Is it a temple of liberty? Is it a temple of. Is it a place, a landscape of liberty, where people can practice their individual rights? Or is it a place where you can make lots of money? Is it an economic powerhouse? Right? And that split remains in every aspect of american politics. So we see it in the break between Jefferson and Hamilton. We see it in the foreign policy of the United States, which on the one hand, stands for liberty and justice, and on the other hand, becomes an imperial power. Right. And here we see it in our, in our concept of how we acquire the west. Okay, are you guys following me saying here there's two different aspects, the ideological and the. And the economic. And acquiring territory for the sake of acquiring territory is driven by economics. Okay, because you want what's on the land. Okay. Or you want the land."

","Today's segment will focus on the settlement of Virginia. The founding of Virginia was primarily an economic venture. The initial impetus for colonization was not the establishment of a new society, but rather the pursuit of wealth in England. Two joint stock companies were formed with this objective in mind, the Virginia Company of Plymouth and the Virginia Company of London. The former, despite its precedents, inadvertently set sail off course and ultimately landed in what we now refer to as New England during the harsh winter months, failing to establish their intended settlement. Conversely, the Virginia Company of London, comprising approximately 100 gentlemen, successfully established a foothold in the region known as the Tidewater area, specifically Jamestown. In the class conscious England of the time, a gentleman was someone of higher standing whose proper pursuits were the clergy, the law, academia, or the military. The idea of manual labor was abhorrent to them. These adventurers envisioned a replication of the spanish conquests, discovering and exploiting a vast native american empire akin to the Aztecs. However, upon their arrival they encountered a stark reality. There was no monolithic empire to conquer, only a mosaic of subsistence level tribes. The english settlers'reluctance to engage in manual labor further compounded their difficulties. Their status as gentlemen precluded them from farming, trading, or any form of physical work which they deemed beneath their social standing. This aversion to labor resulted in significant hardship due to disease, food scarcity, and general unpreparedness for the challenges of colonial life. The turning point for the colony came with the leadership of John Smith, who imposed a regime of work necessary for survival. Despite these adversities, the settlers received intermittent aid from the local native american populations, a narrative popularized and somewhat fictionalized in modern culture, notably through the Disney portrayal of Pocahontas. Nevertheless, the native american subsistence economy could not sustain the needs of the growing english population. Though their initial plan of conquest proved unrealistic, the colonists still owed their investors. Tobacco provided a means of generating income. Tobacco was grown on plantations, requiring much labor. To fill this need, the English experimented with enslaving the Native Americans, but this proved ineffective due to the natives'intimate knowledge of the terrain and their indistinguishable appearance to the colonists, which facilitated escape and evasion. As the colony expanded, the need for a stable and controllable labor force became paramount. Initially, indentured servitude appeared to be a solution, offering Europeans passage and potential land ownership in exchange for years of labor. However, the high mortality rate and deceptive practices by landowners often extended servitude indefinitely, rendering it akin to slavery. Those who experienced the hardship of indentured servitude were literate and wrote back home warning against falling for the false promises of the planters. The introduction of african slaves in 1619 marked a significant shift. Unlike Native Americans, Africans were easily identifiable and unfamiliar with the territory, making them more manageable as a labor force. This led to the growth of a plantationbased economy reliant on slave labor, mirroring feudal systems with land and agricultural output as the primary sources of wealth. The concept of racism as we understand it, a belief in the inherent inferiority of one race over another, had not yet fully crystallized. Instead, the distinctions between free men, indentured servants, and slaves were primarily economic and social, not racial. The settlement of Virginia laid the groundwork for a society that bore resemblance to medieval Europe, with a rigid social hierarchy and an economy centered on land and agriculture. This would have profound implications for the development of the United States, both economically and socially. As we continue our study, we will delve deeper into the ramifications of these early colonial decisions and their lasting impact on american history.

","Today, we're going to actually start talking about politics in the United States. So we've talked about industrialization, we've talked about the movement into the west, and some talk about historiography, and now we're going to talk about industrialization or about politics. And one of the things about the politics of this era is that it is obscure for us. I mean, this era between 1870 and, say, 1915 or so is obscure for us because the issues that happened during that time weren't big issues like what happened before the Civil War. The Civil War, they had issues like the tariffs, and they had issues of, can states secede from the Union? States have to follow federal law, slavery. All these things were big issues that we spend a lot of time talking about in american history. But the latter part of the 19th century, we don't spend that much time talking about. And so it's kind of a political black hole in a way. All right. But there's a couple of different reasons for that, which I'll talk about as we go into it. This era is going to be called the gilded age. Does anybody know what gilded means? Gilded means coded. Right. Coded. Exactly. So coded in gold. Say, for example. Right. If you had, like, a gilded chair. Right. The gilded chair could be made out of cheap wood and painted over, and then it's got a little gold leaf or not just gold paint on it. It makes it look like it's gilded, like it's actually got gold on it, but it doesn't necessarily have to have gold on it. Right. It could be just gold paint or whatever. So what that means is that the chair looks like it's very expensive, but it's really not. It's really cheap. You know what I mean? And what we see happening is that the gilded outside covers up the less attractive inside. Okay? And that's what we see with american life during this era because it's an era of rapid industrialization. So we're going to see some people become incredibly wealthy. Right? We're going to see some people in the United States become more wealthy than the emperor of China, but we'll also see massive amounts of people who are living in poverty and being exploited at the same time. So there's this era of not just income inequality, but really mass inequality, and that creates social upheaval. I think this is a good illustration of the era where you have the millionaires here at the top fields, Goulds, Vanderbilt, and they're sitting on top of their millions, and they're being held up by the workers who are making $3 a week or $11 a week, something like that. Okay. This is the kind of the flavor of this era in american politics, and it's in american history, I should say. But it's sadly also representative in many ways of today because we have massive income inequality today. We have a very small number of people who own enormous amounts of wealth and a huge amount of people who own nothing or close to nothing. Right. I think that we could learn a lot from the gilded age and the progressive era that we're going to be talking about on Wednesday. All right. Well, going back to then saying that politics was not something that we spend a lot of times thinking about, we have to look at how did people consider the government. If I ask you what's going on in the government today as far as what we elected Biden, who's trying to pass the stimulus, extend unemployment, I know Trump is trying to do something with impeachment. Correct. That's all over. But that's a great answer. I appreciate that answer. Here's the reason why it's so important that you answered the way that you did, because both of you guys are talking about what's going on with the federal government, right? So when I say the government, you think the national government. But at the time we're talking about in the 1860s, if I said the government, you wouldn't think about the national government. You would think about your local government. So it would be the city government, the county government, maybe the state government, but the federal government. You knew there was one, but it was far away. It really didn't have any influence on your life. Okay. How many of you guys know who the mayor of San Diego is? Kevin Falcon. That's the old one. Yeah, the new one. But see, you guys are not sure. And how many of you guys know who represents you on the city council? You don't know. Right. So it's really the opposite of that period of time where in that time you knew who was your representative on the city council. It was close to you. And if you really think about it, it makes more sense because if there's a pothole in your street, you're not going to call President Biden and say, look, I need somebody to come and fix my pothole. Right. You're going to call somebody in the city. Right. And so the local government is the government that has more influence on your life than the national government. You guys get what I'm saying? We'll talk more about that as we go through the course here. But the main thing is to understand that at that time, the national government wasn't the big government. And it doesn't become the big government until really it starts during World War I, and we start to see the beginnings of it in a big way during the Great Depression and World War II. We'll talk more about that again as we go through the course. But the point that I'm making is that the government wasn't really engaged in big issues or big issues that people really thought about very much. And the issues that it was engaged in were not, were kind of minor compared to the things that had happened before."

","Up until the time of the seven Years War, the french and indian war, the British, although they theoretically ruled America, they were distracted by politics at home and essentially had lost control of the empire. So that period leading up to the seven years war, from the time of William and Mary up until the time of the seven Years War, the french and indian war was called the era of benign neglect. You guys will remember that, right? The era of benign neglect was when England passed laws for America that Americans ignored, like navigation acts and things like that. And the Americans had developed a real sense of independence. But as a result of the seven years of the french and indian war, the British tried to reassert colonial control in America. Like we had discussed on Monday with the kid who was a latchkey kid, now the parents are trying to assert their rights, and the kids saying, well, I'm grown up now. I don't need a parent to do this kind of stuff. For me, that's kind of the atmosphere, the kind of paradigm, I guess you could say, for what's happened with this relationship between the colonies and Britain. Okay, so now we have really colonies in America, people in America who really have developed their own independence, and we have the mother country, Britain, trying to reestablish colonial control. So the colonists are going to be resistant to this movement by the British to reassert control. And so let's just take a look at some of the actual narrative. And remember, we started talking about the idea of the taxes, right? And the problem here was that the British had won the war, and it had been a great victory for Britain, but at the same time, it was very expensive. And the british people, the english people, were being taxed heavily to pay for this war. And parliament decided that it would be a good idea to tax the Americans because the war had actually gained a lot for the Americans. In theory, it gained all that land that had once been part of the french empire, now is all british. And plus the american colonies had been protected from the French and Indians. And so the parliament said, well, it would be fair for Americans to pay taxes to help pay for this. So Parliament created a tax that basically they put a tax on goods. Anything that was printed. So that would mean newspapers, just regular paper playing cards, books, anything that was printed, you had to pay a tax on it. And the way that they knew the tax was paid was that there would be a stamp on it, right? So they called it the Stamp act. And they said, okay, you colonists have to buy. You have to pay this tax if you want this manufactured material, the problem for the colonies is that because of the mercantile system, the colonies are essentially forbidden from manufacturing their own. The colonies essentially have to buy things from Britain, because that's the structure of the empire, that the colonies exist to provide resources and markets to the industry or to the commercial interest in Britain. So the idea would be that Americans send raw materials to Britain, and then Britain refines those materials and sells them back to the Americans. Right. So that means if you want anything, as a colonist, generally speaking, you have to buy it from Britain. And if you now have to pay a tax on it, then that's going to be a burden on you. Now, we could say, okay, well, taxes are a burden on everybody, but the taxes are paid for the benefit of everybody. But what was the big problem that Americans had with paying this tax? They didn't have any representation. Exactly. They had no representation in parliament, so they did pay taxes. They paid taxes to their local assemblies and to their local townships and things like that. But they didn't pay tax to parliament because they didn't have representation in. Almost like. It's almost like I said the other day, it would be like if the Parliament of Canada decided to tax all Americans on anything, right. If somebody told you you have to pay this tax to. Right. Would you do it? Would you do it willingly? No. Right. And that's the way Americans felt. Okay, so then what happens is there's this group of people who forms, and it's a really loose group. And I think if we think about today's politics, when we think about the Sons of Liberty, we could kind of, in a way, make a comparison to Antifa. I don't know how much you guys know about antifa, but Antifa isn't really an organization. There isn't any president of Antifa. There isn't any antifa headquarters or any of that stuff. It's just that whenever there's a provocation, then groups of people will come together calling themselves Antifa. And that's kind of the way Sons of Liberty were. Sons of Liberty was not an organization, but it was a group of people who would gather to protest what they considered to be wrongdoing by the government. Okay, so, for example, when you guys have read about when the british governor in Massachusetts tried to assert control over Massachusetts, then the sons of Liberty gathered together and burned down his house and stole his dishes and hung him in effigy. Really, when we think about the Sons of Liberty, we want to be able to think about them as patriots. But what we really see is if you were part of the established society, you would look at them as a bunch of terrorists, essentially. Right? Okay. So at any rate, what they did was they organized protests throughout the colonies. Right? So it was in Boston, but it was also throughout the colonies there was protest against this tax measure. And the result was that the parliament repealed the Stamp act. They said, ok, you don't have to pay this tax. Okay? But at the same time, they passed another law called the Declaratory act. And what the declaratory act said was, well, you don't have to pay that tax, but you have to pay tax to parliament. So the declaratory act essentially said that we have the right to tax you, we parliament have the right to tax the colonies, and we will. And so what we see then is that the fundamental problem wasn't really solved by repealing the Stamp act. And then we see that again just a few years later when they decide to enact some other tax, which they called the Townsend duties. Townsend was the name of the prime minister. Right. And the duties is a tax on imports. And pretty much everything that was imported from Britain, you had to pay a tax on it to parliament. And again, as I mentioned to you earlier, the Americans were reliant on imports. So these duties end up being burdensome to the Americans. All right? And the result was that they organized what was called a non importation movement. Okay. And what that meant was that Americans started to manufacture their own things and to make do. Right. The significance of this is that Americans, when they had to manufacture their own things, Americans were not developed to a point where they could actually manufacture things of the same quality as they could import. Okay? So this non importation movement, then, it plants the seeds for american industry, but it also represents a sacrifice on the part of the Americans. The Americans say, well, we would rather live quality goods than have to pay this burden tax. Right? What happens is that Americans say, okay, they unite and say, we're not going to pay the taxes on imports, we're just not going to import anything. Now, if you are in Britain, and who would you be in Britain who relied on exports to America? What part of the economy? Merchants. Merchants, exactly. Okay. So if the Americans aren't importing anything, what's that going to do to your business? Ruin it. It's going to hurt your business, isn't it? Okay, so now if your business is being hurt by the policies of parliament, how do you think that's going to affect parliament? Will the merchants be happy with parliament? Do you think they'll say, oh, yeah, I'm glad parliament is taxing the Americans, because that's ruining my business. You think they'll say that? What do you guys think? No. Right. And so what ends up happening is that they put a lot of pressure on the parliament. Parliament then repeals the Townsend duties. But the thing that we need to really understand here is that every time the parliament tries to assert its authority over America, even though they back down, Americans come to believe that there's a strategy, really, of oppression coming from the parliament. And keep in mind that many people in America don't even think that they should have to answer to parliament. They think that they should answer only to the king. And so, as we talked about on then, what we see then is this growing tension between Americans and the British, where both sides have become entrenched and they're not able to really gauge the acts of the other party. Okay. And one of the things that makes this worse, actually, is that there are a number of people in America who have decided that it's time to break away from England, that they shouldn't actually be subject to Britain anymore. And what they will do then is they will publish materials that will paint the actions of the British in the worst possible light. For example, Samuel Adams. Not the beer guy, but a different guy. Samuel Adams in Boston, published a paper that was incredibly critical of everything that the British did. Right to the point, almost in some cases, of what we would call fake news. Right. But it had an effect on the people of Boston because they became more and more unhappy. They would become more and more in favor of the idea of breaking away. Okay. All right. Now, in March of. One. One example of this is in March of 1770, there was an incident that happened where the sons of liberty who were. Again, if we were to look at this event and we saw the Sons of Liberty, we wouldn't think of it as. We probably wouldn't think of it as some kind of an organization. We would think of it as a mob. Okay. And their sons of liberty were actually harassing the soldiers who were guarding the customs house in Boston. All right. Well, the customs house is where they collect the taxes. And Americans at this point, see the taxes as their great oppressor. Right? And so they're actually harassing the british soldier who's guarding that, and they start throwing rocks at him. Okay? Now, some of the accounts say they were throwing snowballs. They really weren't throwing snowballs. There was snow, but they put rocks in the middle of them. Right? And so they're throwing rocks at the soldier, and he calls for help, and then some other soldiers come out of the barracks to. To defend him. And then right in the middle of this kind of crisis, I guess you could say that's happening, this heightened tension. Somebody yells fire. And it's really unclear actually who did. But what ends up happening is the british fire on the Americans, and a number of Americans are killed. Okay, well, now, that's bad enough, but there's a british law that says that the british military can't fire on british civilians without the express permission of the king, right? Which meant that when the soldiers fired on the british subjects, they were committing a felony, and the punishment for that felony is death. And so the soldiers were tried in Boston. And interestingly, the man who defended them was a lawyer named John Adams. Okay, John Adams at this point was just a lawyer. He wasn't really a revolutionary. He believed in the law, and he thought he knew that everybody needed a defense. And these guys were unpopular, right? So he defended these unpopular soldiers because been essentially roundly condemned by the local population. They'd already been convicted in public opinion, right? But he argued successfully that they couldn't be held liable, and they were acquitted. Okay, so the problem, of course, with that is that the way that the press will portray that is that the british soldiers violated the law. They committed a felony, and then they got off the hook, right? And it will show then that the British aren't even following their own laws in their oppression against us. You guys get that? Okay? So it creates more tension between the British and the Americans. Now, we'll move forward a little bit later. I think I mentioned this the other day when I was talking about taxation, and I talked about the problem with the British East India Company and how the British East India Company was in danger of going bankrupt. And so parliament decided to rescue them by giving them the monopoly on the tea trade. And so what that meant was that if you were going to buy tea in America, you had to buy, or anywhere in the empire, you had to buy it from the British East India Company. And as I mentioned to you, the parliament thought that this would be well received by the colonists because they knew that the colonists would be able to get the tea really cheap, right? So the idea then was that Americans will have to buy the British East India Company tea, but they'll get it really cheap, so they should be happy. Okay, well, they weren't happy. They were very unhappy. And so one of the kind of results of that is going to be, that's when Americans decide to stop drinking tea. And instead, they drink coffee. So that's why we have Starbucks coffee rather than Starbucks tea, I guess. Right. But there was what they call the tea Party. And what that meant was there was a group of people, interestingly, dressed up as Native Americans, who went onto the ships at night and threw the tea in the harbor and destroyed a lot of tea. Right. But now I got a little clip I want to show you here of not the tea party itself, but the atmosphere in Boston at the time. And it comes from a miniseries called John Adams, which was on HBO. I think you can find it pretty much everywhere. And it's a really interesting and pretty well done and historically accurate video. But I want to show you this one little scene concerning the issue of tea. All right, so let me go ahead and show that here. What is it Mr. Hancock requires of me? You'd like your advice? If he is in need of legal advice, I will speak to him. John Adams is Sam Adams. Exercise to win me over the business. John, the dock, the Eleanor, the beaver, just in their holes full of tea. All British Ships, the king demands their cargo be unloaded. Cargo which we, the citizens of Boston, must pay new taxes, subject to arrest. You will not laugh. This cargo, gentlemen, this is legitimate cargo. Tea from the East India Company that you are bound by law to unload. What's legitimate about it, friend? No other tea is allowed in Boston Harbour. Either we drink the king's foul brew or nothing at all. And who may you be, sir? John Hancock, ship owner. Not John Hancock, smuggler. What's your word, sir? I'm an honest man being strangled by monopoly. Shame on you, sir. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Teach him a lesson. Bastard. Barberism. Barberism. Animal. I of this. People are hurt when they fight for what is right. Approve of brutal and illegal act to enforce a political principle to have. Answer me that. Can you die? So there's your sons of liberty. What do you guys think? Can you hear me? It was insane. It was terrible. Well, that was. Did you guys know about that before? Anybody have known about that? That was actually based on a true event. And actually, the guy who was tard and feathered lived. He was mutilated, actually, but he lived. So how does that affect your thinking about what we call the sons of liberty, the american patriots? Because that mob, that was the sons of Liberty, right? What do you guys think about that? They acted like a bunch of barbarians. Yeah. So can you see how if you were the British, or if you were in established society and you saw these things going on around you. Even though the TTax may have been burdensome, it may have been an oppression, but was this a proper response to it? And interestingly, it wasn't that behavior that was condemned by the people at the time. We look at the tea party now. A lot of people say, oh, yeah, the Tea party. That was a heroic act. It was an act that really leads up to the american revolution, right? And so the people who did it were all patriots and that sort of thing. But the reality was that it wasn't the brutality that people were against. George Washington was against it. A lot of people were against it. It wasn't the brutality. It was the fact that they were destroying private property. They would draw the lines. The whole thing that they were fighting for was the protection, preservation of private property, right? So if you take somebody's property and throw it in the ocean, then that's a bridge too far for the Americans, right? You guys get what I'm saying? So that tells us a lot, I think, about the kind of environment that the american revolution came out of. And that environment was very different from the idealized, mythologized environment that we learn about when we're in elementary school, for example, of the heroic american patriots and the brutal and oppressive British. You guys get what I'm saying? So hopefully, now, I didn't do this because I think that there was something wrong with the American Revolution or any of that stuff. It's not my place to judge it. I just want us to be able to see past the mythology to the reality of what actually happened at that time. Okay, so what happens then is that the parliament will learn about the Tea Party. It was an enormous amount of money that was destroyed. And what will happen is the parliament will pass a series of acts called the Coercive Acts, which Americans call the intolerable acts, right. And this series of acts will essentially close the port of Boston until the money that was destroyed is repaid. Not only do they close the port of Boston, but then they also take away the right of the people in Massachusetts to govern themselves. They impose a royal governor. They essentially make the assembly illegal. Right? So that's going to be the response of the parliament. So there again, we can see this tendency where the British tried to assert royal control and the Americans resist it. And then the response to that is going to be even more control by the British rather than trying to work things out."

","We can characterize the western response led by the United States to the Soviet Union's expansionist strategy as being as consisting of three pillars. All right, so it's kind of like a three legged stool, if you would. I think if you could think about it that way. Right. And the three pillars of the three legs of this stool are ideological, economic and military. All right, so let me just go through these. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about events that happened in Europe that cause these responses to be formulated. Okay. The first one has to do with the idea of expanding communism. All right. So one of the things that happens after World War two is that even though the war had been won by the western countries, there was a lot of economic unrest in all throughout Europe because Europe had been devastated by the war. And particularly in southeastern Europe, there is a lot of unrest and a lot of poverty. And there are soviet, or I should say, communist movements, revolutionary movements in both Greece and Turkey, as well as other places. And there is a fear that the Soviets. Well, the Soviets are supporting the communist revolutionaries, obviously, and there's a fear that if the west doesn't respond to that, then they will fall to communism. And so what happens then is that the president Truman will go to Congress and ask for money to support these regimes in Greece and Turkey, keeping in mind that he's phrasing his support for the governments in Greece and Turkey, a support for democracy, because this is what drives american foreign policy. American foreign policy is to support democracy. The problem is that neither one of these countries are democratic countries. But it doesn't matter, because what happens is that out of that debate, I guess you could say, comes what we call the Truman doctrine. And the Truman doctrine is that the United States will oppose the spread of communism anywhere. All right. So that's the first pillar, the ideological pillar, that says that the United States will oppose the spread of communism everywhere. It doesn't mean that the United States is going to try to defeat communism, but it means that it won't allow it to spread. Okay. Questions, comments about that. All right. The second part, then, is, again, that there's a lot of, there are many people. Well, let's, let's look at it this way. Let's go back to when we were talking about the depression. And one of the problems with the depression was that people were starving. People didn't have what they needed to live, and they were afraid that they weren't going to be able to get what they needed to live. And so one of the solutions that many people thought would be appropriate was communism or socialism. And we saw, for example, in the United States, that some people thought socialism was going to be a good idea. And recall that I told you before, the only time socialism seems like a good idea is when you don't have anything, because it's about sharing. Right? If you don't have the example I always use, if you have a car and I don't have a car, then I think you should lend me your car. But if I have a car and you don't have a car, I think you should get your own car. I'm saying, and that's the idea, that the kind of appeal of socialism is that when nobody has anything, then the idea of sharing everything seems like a good idea. And that was a situation in Europe and many other places in the world after World War Two, that the economies had been devastated. And so there was a fear on the part of the west, particularly the Americans, that if this economic crisis wasn't addressed, that there was a real possibility that people in Europe would actually vote their way into communism. And so what happened was that the United States decided to or proposed a conference. They called together all of the former participants in the war, including the Soviet Union and the eastern, what they call the Warsaw Pact countries. Right. To. What the United States basically said was, you guys come up with a plan for economic recovery and tell us how much it's going to cost and we'll give you the money. Okay, so obviously, the eastern bloc didn't participate because the whole point of it was to defeat communism. But the western countries, that's, most of these other countries come together and they come up with a plan for economic recovery, and they, the United States actually gives them the money. It's called the Marshall Plan because it was announced by Secretary of state Marshall in 1947. But the idea is to bring about economic recovery in Western Europe so that communism no longer seems like a good solution. And this is probably the single most successful american foreign policy initiative ever, because the United States forked over the money. But within just a few months, the economy of Western Europe starts to rebound, and the result of it is going to be that the appeal of socialism lessens. It kinds of, kind of vanishes. You guys are with me on this. So, so that's going to be the second pillar, then, the economic pillar, that the United States helps to rebuild the economy of western Europe, including Germany, for the purpose of making communism, socialism, less attractive. And it worked. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about that? Okay, the final one actually ends up being the military one. And here's where we can kind of see where it comes from. During the Potsdam conference, the Americans and the Soviets and the Germans and the French basically had divided Berlin into four different zones of occupation. All right? At the end of the war, Berlin was about 100 miles behind the russian lines, I should say east of the russian lines. Right? Okay. So basically, then what happened was that the city of Berlin is connected to West Germany by a single road and an air corridor. And at the Potsdam conference, they divided Berlin into four different zones of occupation, which eventually will be consolidated into two, east and West Berlin. East Berlin will be controlled by the Soviets or the east german communist party. West Berlin will be controlled by the western allies. Basically, it will be controlled by the german government in West Germany, but it's an island in the middle of a sea of communism, essentially. So again, we have this half of a city that is 100 miles inside the soviet territory, connected only by a single road and an air corridor. At the end of the war, both sides, the Soviets and the west, contemplated continuing the war. Churchill basically said that the west should immediately declare war on the Soviets to take over the rest of Europe, because if they didn't, they would be. They would be in conflict with them for a long time. Which turned out to be true. But people were done with war. They didn't want any more war, so they stopped. But nevertheless, the Soviets still thought that there may be some benefit to stressing the western alliance or the western powers militarily. And so one thing that happens then is that the Soviets will close the road between West Germany and West Berlin. And the reason some people say that the road is closed is that they're provoking the west, that Stalin was provoking the west, provoking an attack by the west, saying that the west hoping that the west would then use military force to try to reopen the road, which would then lead to further conflict, which at which point then Stalin would hope that he could take the rest of Europe. You guys are following me here, okay? Does that make sense? You guys got that? But that's not what happened. What happened instead was that the west mounted an airlift. You guys have heard of it, the Berlin airlift, right? And the Berlin. What they did was that they started to supply everything that was needed in West Berlin by air. So there was a constant airlift of goods from the west into Berlin, which lasted almost a year, and then at the end of that year, the Soviets reopened the road, and this situation then remained until the 1990s. Okay, but what it showed was that the Soviets were a military threat in western Europe. And so what happened was that the United States formed an alliance called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO. Right. And this alliance was all of the. Essentially all the green countries. And the purpose of the alliance was to oppose the spread of soviet, opposed, soviet expansion in western Europe. Okay, so that's the third leg then. The third leg of the. Of the strategy is the military legs we have. Ideological. The United States will oppose the spread of communism everywhere. Economic. The United States will help to rebuild the economy of western Europe so that. So that communism doesn't seem to be attractive and military, meaning that they would. That the west would stand strong against soviet military expansion in Europe. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Now, one of the things that. Are there any questions? You guys got this? All right, so one thing that you'll notice is that I've been talking about Europe, right? And we think of the cold War as being a worldwide conflict, which it was. Right. Here's where we're going to see a problem, right. The problem is that the conflict in Europe ends up being. I think that you can actually contain it within the rhetoric, the language of the Cold War, right? So the Cold War basically was a fundamental contest between socialism and capitalism, but the rest of the world was under a different set of pressures. Okay, and let me just kind of show you here. Where we see the Cold War happening is in the northern hemisphere, right? And where we see the southern hemisphere, I should say the southern hemisphere, is experiencing a different crisis. And this crisis is known as decolonization. Between 1945 and 1965, all of the countries that were colonized by Europe in the southern hemisphere are going to become independent. The problem is that when they become independent, they're going to. Their economies will be crippled by a century or more of colonialism, because colonialism, the colonial powers, ruled these countries and dominated these countries for the benefit of extracting value. So all of the infrastructure and all of the economies are set up to provide wealth to the mother countries, to the colonizing powers, but not for the people of the colonies. And so what will happen then is that many of these colonies are going to be struggling, or I should say many of these independent countries now are going to be struggling with collapsed economies. And some of them are going to think that socialism might not be a bad idea. Okay, so as I mentioned to you guys, if you don't have anything, then socialism seems like a good idea. Right? And what will happen then is that those countries will be targets of the Soviets in terms of their strategy of spreading communism. Because basically what ends up happening then is that the process of decolonization essentially gets intertwined with the process of the cold war. And so what ends up happening is that both the Soviets and the western alliance will see these struggling countries as opportunities for expanding their influence. And basically what will end up happening is that these countries that were formerly colonized will be asked to make a choice by both the United States and the Soviet Union to choose what side they're on. Because the way that the world looked to the Soviets and the Americans was that there were only two things, only two worlds. There was the first world, which was the american world, and then there was the second world, which was the communist world. Okay, you guys are with me. And both of these are saying, you have to choose. You have to be on one side or the other. Okay, you guys get it? Well, the problem is that I should say it this way. Well, we can call it a problem, I guess. Some countries, starting with India. India was ruled by a man named Nehru. And Nehru realized that neither the Soviet Union nor the United States were really interested in their benefit. Both of them were interested in the expansion of their own influence, but neither of them was really interested in the benefit of the formerly colonized countries. And so what Nehru did was he proposed a third alternative called the Non Aligned Movement. The non Aligned movement. What it means is that these countries are not aligned with either the Soviets or the Americans. You guys get what I'm saying? These countries are saying we're not, we're not going to choose a side. We're going to stay out of it because what your conflict, it has nothing to do with our crisis, essentially. And so that's where we see the beginning, the creation of what's called the third world. All right? The first world is the american and their alliance. The second world is the communist bloc. The third world is all of those countries that refuse to choose. Okay? And so one of the things that we'll notice then, if I asked you what is a third world country? How do you know something is a third world country? How would you, how would you respond? What characterizes a third world country? The way that I learned it is just like countries that are less developed, countries that are less developed, okay? And that results in what? It's like technology and like, like, I guess, military expansion on top of that, like economic power. Okay? So if, if they're not developed, then what are they? Economically? They're poor, right? We think about third world countries to say any place where it's poor. They say, what's a third world country? Right? And the reason for that is because all of these countries that were not aligned were, were poor, right? But they were not aligned because they were not called the third world because they were poor. They were called the third world because they were not aligned. You guys get what I'm saying? So third world doesn't necessarily, or at least originally, didn't mean just poor countries. It meant countries that were not engaged in the cold war. You guys are with me. So the only reason why it's important for you to know that is that when you're at your next academic cocktail party and somebody brings up the third world, you could say, oh, did you know? So I'm sure you guys go to those parties, right? All right, so at any rate, so that's, that's the main thing that we want to point out here, is that there's, there's basically two different major processes happening at the same time between 1964 or actually between 1945 and going on at least to the middle of the, of the sixties, right? And that is the cold war essentially in the northern hemisphere and decolonization in the southern hemisphere. Okay, you guys are with me. And what's going to happen, the tragedy is going to be that the superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States are going to see decolonization only in terms of their own ideological conflict. And the results going to be that the United States, for example, will look at, for example, in Guatemala and Guatemala, they're going to establish a socialist government that's not influenced by the Soviets. But the Americans, as soon as they see socialism, will say, aha, Moscow. And so the United States will oppose them, right? And the result then will be where the United States could recognize the poverty that's trying to be addressed and assist. Instead, they make them into enemies. You follow what I'm saying here? And this is going to be the problem that we're going to see it really everywhere. But the most painful place we're going to see it is going to be in Vietnam, right? Because the people of Vietnam want to be free of french colonialism, but they don't particularly want to be communist. But the United States will see the struggle only in terms of communism versus capitalism or democracy, how the Americans say it. And as a result of that, will instead of trying to uplift the vietnamese people, they'll bomb them and we'll just see how that goes, right. So anyway, questions, comments about any of that?"

","We talked about how the War of 1812 had led to the end of the two of the first party system because the Federalists kind of passed from the scene. The Federalists became. Were viewed as traitors, in a way, because they had been against the War of 1812. And so there's a period of time between 1814 or so and the 1820s when basically there's only one party, and it's the same as the democratic Republicans that were the first party. Okay? And as I also mentioned to you, politics at that time then becomes regional. Okay? And so what happens then, in 1824, there's an election, a presidential election, and the three major candidates are John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay from Kentucky, and Andrew Jackson from Tennessee. And the election ends up. The election ends up in the house because nobody, none of them actually gain a majority in the electoral college. Remember that in order to be elected president, you have to gain a majority in the electoral college and in the house, Adams makes a deal with Henry Clay. And that deal, essentially, is that if you give your support to me in the election, in the House, I'll make you secretary of state. Okay? It's very similar to what happened with Obama and Clinton in 2008, when Obama convinced Clinton to follow him or to give her support to him, and in return, she became secretary of state. Okay, so then what ends up happening is that. Is that the election goes to Adams. Even though Jackson had really won the popular vote, he had more votes than anybody else. So Jackson. Andrew Jackson. Keep in mind, Andrew Jackson is the hero of New Orleans, right? Is incensed, and he goes on a campaign to oust Adams from the White House in the next election, all right? He called this deal between Adams and Clay the corrupt bargain. And the idea here is that even though Jackson won the most votes, Adams became president, and it was because of this corruption, okay? And what it demonstrates to us is, in the United States called patronage. And so patronage is political favors in return for political rewards. Right? And I'm not going to really go into all this yet, just a second. But I wanted to mention that it was patronage. That it was patronage that caused the election to go to Adams. Let's think about patronage and how it works. Patronage is actually part of american politics even today, as I discussed with Jack, with Clinton and Obama. Right? And what it is is that you give somebody your political support, which represents votes, and in return, you get political favors, which is jobs. Okay? So in the case of Adams and Clay, Clay gave his support to Adams, and in return, he got secretary of state. You guys get what I'm saying Clinton gave her support to Obama and in return, she got secretary of state. You get what I'm saying here? Okay, so. So it works at that level, and it still works at that level today, right? Because all of the, all of the cabinet, like the secretary of state and secretary of treasury and all the people that Biden has just appointed in the last couple months are all serving at the pleasure of the president, right? So that means that their jobs depend on the president being in place. When the president leaves, they don't have a job anymore. Right? So, for example, secretary of state under Trump was Pompeo. When Biden became president, Pompeo is no longer secretary of state. You guys get what I'm saying? That's how it works. Okay? But what's going to happen, the thing that Jackson is going to do is he's going to mobilize all these new voters with a more expanded version of patronage. And in order for us to understand that, I want us to think about it in practical terms. Okay. And in practical terms, what we're talking about is whole neighborhoods, for example, in a city being organized to vote for a certain candidate. Okay? And this is how it happens. And this is one way that it happens anyway. That, for example, in the 1820s, there is a pretty big immigration from, say, Ireland. In the early part of the 19th century, there was a huge immigration of people from Ireland. What would happen would be that if you were an immigrant from Ireland, you more likely would be a young man, single, and you would come to a city like New York. And when you were in there, in that city, you would need a job. So you would go to the irish section of the city, and you would go to a hiring hall. And at the hiring hall, that was run by a guy who we call the boss, right? Not like, you know, bowser and Super Mario brothers, but a political boss. And you would ask the boss for a job, and the boss would give you a job, and you would work as that job on that job for the whole year until the next election. But on election day, your job was to make sure everybody got out and voted, because when everybody voted for the guy who was the police commissioner, that meant that the police commissioner could. Could allow the boss to continue to give out the police jobs. So your job as a policeman depended on the police commissioner being in office, and the police commissioner in office gave that power of jobs over to the boss. Does that make sense to you guys? Do you understand what I'm saying here? I know. I don't think I explained it very well, so, although I know what I'm talking about, I just can't get it. I can't communicate it. All right, do you guys get what I'm saying here? So if I'm an immigrant from Ireland or I'm an immigrant from anywhere, or I'm anybody, and I want a job, I go to the hiring hall. And the hiring hall. The guy who's in control of the hiring hall controls the government jobs. And the reason why he controls the government jobs is because the person who is in city official who is in charge of those jobs has given me that power in return for me delivering the votes for him. Does that make sense? You understand? I pretty much only see a bunch of blank faces. The ones I can see. Yeah, I get it. Okay. All right. So now, did any of you guys ever wonder, have you ever seen a Bugs bunny cartoon? Do you ever notice that on the Bugs bunny cartoon, the cops all have a certain accent? Whenever they have cops in a Bugs bunny cartoon, they always have certain accents. Let's watch. Okay, Clancy, take the boys and surround the house. Jiggas. Fellas, the cops. Open up. This is the police. All right, Rabbit, where's Rocky? Where's he hiding? He's not in this stove. Oh, he's hiding in the stove, eh? Would I turn on the gas if he was in there? You might, Robert. You might. Well, would I throw a lighted match in there if he was in there? Oh, no, you don't take me with you. Don't leave me with that story. I confess. I get it. I get it. Arrest me. Arrest me. So do you see that what I was talking. This is good demonstration of what I was talking about. And now you know why cops and Bugs Bunny cartoons have irish accents, right? And you thought this class was going to be a waste of time, but. So anyway, so that's the idea of patronage. And it's going to be endemic in american politics all the way through the 19th century. Okay? And you can go ahead and watch. You can go ahead and read this later on your own. The thing about it is that it creates loyalty on the part of people who are voters because their jobs are at stake. But it also creates problems. Right? And these are some of the problems that it creates. Corruption and incompetence. Right? Because people are put in positions that they're not qualified to actually perform. Okay, so at any rate, that's the issue of patronage, and it's going to become really representative of american politics. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments?"
88,"US2: 531 -US2: 531
","We talked about the Cold War. And one of the major points that I brought up about the Cold War was that the cold war happened between 1945 and really about 1992 or three. And at the same time, there was another phenomenon or process happening in the world. Does anybody remember what that other process was? Decolonization. Exactly. Decolonization. And that means that all the formerly colonized countries or almost all the formerly colonized countries became independent sometime between 1945 and 1965. Okay? And so while the consequence of the. Of decolonization was to create a large number of very poor countries who are struggling with the effects of colonialism, and all of that is happening in the context of this ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. And what we're going to do today is we're going to actually show two different examples of that. Of that. Of that, I guess, the confluence of events. And I'm going to start with Kuba, and then I'm going to talk about. I'm going to start talking about Vietnam. Okay, so before I get started, any questions, comments about anything? All right, well, you guys will recall that we talked about Cuba a bit earlier when we were talking about imperialism, and we talked about how the United States, at the beginning of the war, spanish american war, declared that it had no interest in annexing Cuba, that the american involvement in the spanish american war was simply to assist the independence movement in Cuba. And that was. That was stated in what becomes known as the Teller amendment. But then you'll also recall that at the end of the war, the United States actually created a constitution for Cuba, and at the same time declared in another amendment, the Platt Amendment, that the United States had the right to intervene in Cuba anytime that the cuban government acted in a way that was irresponsible. So what would be a way that the cuban government could act irresponsibly and trigger american involvement? What do you guys think? How do you think that? What do you think that means? That the United States can decide how the government of Cuba could act in an irresponsible way? Do you guys remember that part of the reason why the United States got involved in Cuba was because of the sugar industry, that the Americans actually owned the sugar fields and the sugar processing plants, and that the unrest in Cuba before the spanish american war was creating problems for american businessmen? And so the american businessmen were lobbying to get the Americans involved in Cuba to establish some stability so that they could continue to make money. Right, and what ended up happening was that after the war was over, the United States then continues to dominate the cuban economy. So that's what we would call. Before we had mentioned, we called it economic imperialism. That the United States, theoretically, that Cuba actually rules itself, is sovereign. But at the same time, the United States controls its economy because american business interests control the sugar fields. And that's the major export of Cuba, its monostaple economy. Right? And so what that means then, is that the United States supports men who are theoretically elected to office, but who also support the rights of american business interests. And if those interests are threatened, then the United States can send in troops, okay? And that would be what it meant to be irresponsible. Irresponsible would mean basically the idea of nationalizing the sugar industry, because what had happened was that because the Americans owned the sugar fields and the sugar industry, there was a movement among some people in Cuba to take those assets away from american business and nationalize them so that the profits from the sugar industry wouldn't go to american business owners, but to the cuban people. You guys are following me here. One of these people was named Fidel Castro. And the one thing that we want to know about Fidel, Fidel Castro, is that he was not a communist, okay? He was a nationalist, an economic nationalist. And what that meant was that he believed that the government of Cuba should act for the benefit of the people of Cuba, and not for the benefit of american business interests, but american. Excuse me, I'm sorry, here. American government actually supports a number of different dictators in Cuba, so long as they play ball with the american business interest. You guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? Okay, so there actually, there was a kind of a little bit of a rebellion in Cuba in the 1920s, and Castro was arrested and eventually got out of jail and went to Mexico. But then he's going to. To look for. He's going to try another invasion, another takeover of the cuban government in the 1950s. And what ends up happening is that he ends up fighting a guerrilla war from the hills, and eventually that guerrilla war will be successful. What happens is that there is a. I forgot the name of the dictator. Whoever was in Batista, Juan Bautista was in control of Cuba. And it became obvious to Americans that Bautista was no longer in control. And so the Americans abandoned support of Bautista. He went into exile, and Castro then came to power. And the american government initially supported Castro because they said, well, you can be, you know, Bautista was our guy, but now you can be our guy. But the problem was that Fidel didn't want to play along, all right? And he was serious about nationalizing the sugar industry. He had a, he had a, one of his kind of right hand men advisor was a man named Ernesto Guevara, who you probably know as Che. Che Guevara, right. And he was an argentine doctor, but he was a committed socialist. Castro was not a communist or socialist. Castro was actually against the communist party. He refused to allow the communist party to participate in the government that he established in Cuba. But his idea of nationalizing the sugar industry was really seen by many as a socialist, a movement towards Marxism, kind of, in a way. Right. So what happens then is that Castro alienates the american government because he's in favor of nationalizing the sugar industry. And from the american point of view, nationalizing the sugar industry is communism. Okay? And remember what we talked about on Monday. If Americans see communism anywhere, who's behind it? Russia. Russia. Exactly. In this case, Russia was not behind it and Castro was not a communist. But if your enemy in the 1960s is the United States, then who's your friend? Russia. Russia. Russia. Exactly. And so what happens is that the United States declares an embargo against Cuba, basically saying, not going to buy your sugar anymore, which is devastating to the cuban economy because that's all the money that they make, is by selling sugar to America. And instead what happens is that the russian government comes in and says, okay, we're going to support your sugar industry. We're going to give you subsidies for your sugar industry, but you have to say that you're a communist. You have to have a communist government. Castro at that point then says, okay, I'm a communist. I've always been a communist and I will always be a communist. Even though historically he wasn't a communist. Right. So why did he all of a sudden now say that he was a communist? Because. Oh, sorry. Because he had russian support. And in order to get that russian support. Yeah. So instead of the United States supporting economic independence for Cuba, they essentially drove them into the arms of the Soviets. You follow what I'm saying? And I should say this, that the soviet presence in Cuba wasn't necessarily good for the cuban people, but nevertheless, the fact that it falls into the russian orbit was based on the misconception of Americans that communism was associated only with the Soviet Union. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about that? All right, so. So now what happens is I'm not going to go into the Bay of Pigs, although the Bay of Pigs, you can look it up. It's in the book. The thing about the Bay of Pigs was it demonstrated to the world, essentially, that the United States was willing to use military force to overthrow Castro. And then as a result of that, the Soviets start to install nuclear missiles in Cuba. The thing about the nuclear missiles in Cuba is that these missiles were in position where you can see this big red circle here. They could have devastated all of these american cities, including Washington, DC. Okay. The reality of the situation, which is often overlooked, is that the Americans, the United States had missiles in turkey pointed at the Soviet Union that were in range of Moscow. Right. And so the Soviets had been trying for years to get the Americans to remove those missiles. And they saw this as an opportunity to leverage that desire by installing missiles in Cuba. The idea being they installed the missiles in Cuba. And now if the United States demands that those missiles be removed, then the Soviets will demand that american missiles are removed from Turkey. You guys follow what I'm saying here? This makes sense to you guys? Do you guys know about this? Yeah, I remembered it was like a failed invasion of the Bay of pigs. And that kind of like, set everyone off and, like scared. Right. Okay. So now what happens then is that the United States learns about these missile installations by satellite, essentially by spy satellite, right. Or spy airplanes. And instead of going to war over it, President Kennedy actually declares an embargo around Cuba. This is the exclusion zone right here, the kind of the purplish area. Right. And basically says that any ship that crosses into this exclusion zone is subject to destruction. And what that's aimed at is the material coming from Russia to Cuba to support these missiles. And so there was a standoff. The standoff lasted for about a week. And it basically was that the United States and the Soviet Union were on the brink of a nuclear war. And it was a very real possibility. And this is one of the reasons why, when you guys read the book the Good War, and the last story in there was about the street corner kids and how they were afraid that they weren't going to live long enough to have lives because of the nuclear weapons. Right. This is what contributed to that. Americans were terrified of nuclear weapons. And really everybody in the world was at the time. Right? Okay. So anyway, eventually what happens is that what Kennan had predicted, you guys will remember the long telegram from Monday. And what Kennan had predicted was that if you go toe to toe with the Russians all the way up to the brink of war, that they would back down. And that's exactly what happened. So they get right to the brink of war and Khrushchev decides to pull the missiles out of Cuba. Another thing that's little known is that when Khrushchev removed the missiles from Cuba. The United States also removed its missiles from Turkey. And that was actually a quid pro quo, but it wasn't advertised, so it made it look like Russia had backed down. And that's just the way history records it. But the main point here in terms of talking about Cuba is that the whole issue was created by the fact that the United States saw the Soviets where they weren't. Because for the Americans, communism was a monolithic world movement based in Moscow. And they could not imagine that any other country would opt for communism without encouragement from the Soviet Union. You guys are with me. And so basically then, the whole thing was created by that mischaracterizing communism in Cuba as part of the Cold War."

","We're going to go ahead then, and we're going to think about some other issues having to do with this new territory. So this was the result of the compromise of 1850. Okay. What we want to do is think about what was the purpose of the mexican american war? Why did Polk want the territory in California? Why did Polk want California? So you could do overseas trade with China. Right, trade with China. And the reason why was because San Francisco was a great natural harbor, and if the United States could trade with China from San Francisco, that would give them a leg up on the Europeans. Right? But the problem is, once you get goods to California from China, how are you going to get it to the east, where all the people are? And the answer to that was, well, if you were going to do it by sea, you had to go all the way around South America to do it. There's no Panama Canal. Right? So. So how are you going to get the goods from, actually Sacramento to, say, Chicago, the east? Are you going to do that? Railroads. Exactly. But here's the problem. Think about this. If you are going to build a railroad, keep in mind that railroads are very. They're high tech. They're like space shuttles today. Right? Okay, so you're going to build a high tech railroad. In fact, Americans didn't know how to build railroads. They had to hire british companies to do it. Right, but you're going to build a railroad from, say, Chicago to Sacramento, but it's going to go across territory that's unorganized, where that's occupied by hostile natives. Is that going to seem like a reasonable investment? Do you think it would be a good idea to invest in a really high tech project? That's going to be. It's going to go through unorganized territory that's occupied by hostile natives? No. No. All right, so that's when Congress decides to. To organize what was left of the Louisiana purchase. Okay? And that's this territory that you see here. They divided into two territories, Nebraska and Kansas. Okay? And when Kansas was. Was made a territory, it was decided that it would be admitted by popular sovereignty. Right? Popular sovereignty means that whatever they decide, whether they want to be slaver free, they can be admitted. Okay? Now let's think about and see if we can remember. How is it that states are incorporated into the union before I. Well, let me just say this, okay? States are incorporated into the union according to the Northwest ordinance, which was written before the Constitution, and in that it specifies that the congress creates a territory and appoints a governor, and then people move into the territory, and once they have reached a certain population, then they have a congress, write a constitution, and then they could. And they can apply for admission to the union. And then when they do apply, they even reply to slaver free. Okay, at this point, you guys are following me here. That's how it works. There's only 15 states that weren't added to the union that way. The original 13 colonies were directly part of the United States. What were the other two states? What were the other two states that never became a territory before they were admitted to the union? Was one of them Louisiana? No, Louisiana was a territory. How about doing this? Take a look. Just look down at the floor. Florida. What? I said look down at the floor. What state is that? California. California was one of them. California. Was it already Oregon? No, not Oregon. If we've learned about it already, the Alamo and the Republic of Texas. Texas. Right. So Texas and California were the only other two states that were added without being a territory. Okay, because you're with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so now they pass this Kansas Nebraska act. Kansas is organized as a territory. People start to move in. All right? Now, it says here, supported by southerners and denounced by northerners. Okay, that's true. Right? Why would it be supported by southerners? Why would the Kansas Nebraska act be supported by slave interests? Because Nebraska is above the Missouri compromise line. Well, we're talking about Kansas now, but, yeah, Kansas is above that line and because of popular sovereignty. What does that mean? Can Kansas be a slave state? It could be if people choose. Right? It could be if people choose. Okay. All right, so slave interests are going to be interested in that because they think that Kansas could possibly be a slave state, but northerners are going to be against it. And why would they be against it? Because they hold abolitionist views and they're above. And they see it as being above the Missouri compromise. Well, the first one is not that big of a deal. All right, so there are a number of abolitionists. There's. Abolitionism is kind of a new, I guess you could say, attitude among many people in the north. But most people don't care about slavery one way or the other. Right. Because it doesn't affect them. The major problem with admitting new voting states has to do with representation in Congress. Right? Exactly. Okay, so. And then it erases the Missouri compromise line. All right, so we just leave it at that. Okay, you guys are with me. But here's the problem. The problem is that because it's going to be settled by popular sovereignty, then both the slave interest and the free interests have incentive to send more people who are in favor of or opposed to slavery if you guys are with me. And so what happens is that there is a mass movement of people from both the north and the south into Kansas, with the idea being that whoever can get the most people living there will be able to choose whether it's slave or free. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, well, here's the problem. That it's going to become obvious to these people that neither side is going to be able to gain a meaningful advantage over the other in terms of numbers. And so the next best thing is to kill everybody on the other side. So what happens is that there's a war that breaks out in Kansas in the late 1850s between slave interests and free interests. Okay? So you can kind of think about it as the civil war has already started. Before the civil war started, it's because they're already fighting about this in Kansas, and the slave interests are sending troops and weapons, and the. The free interests are also sending troops and weapons, and it becomes brutal. That's why they call it bleeding Kansas. You guys following a fan? Questions about this? All right, now, how many of you guys have heard of John Brown? That. See, that's discouraging to me because a John Brown was a very important individual in american history. He was probably mostly seen by most of the good people as a criminal, right? But. And he was actually, if you think about it, he was a rabid abolitionist, meaning that he was absolutely uncompromising on the issue that slavery should be abolished. And his idea of how to abolish slavery was to kill all the slave owners. Right. So in Kansas, he becomes very important as a leader of the abolitionists. And he and his sons are involved in an incident called the Pottawatomie Creek massacre, where they actually murder a bunch of slave owners with axes. Right. Okay, so now, if you guys have looked at this picture probably every day before you start the class, because this is the image, I guess, for this course, this guy standing here in the middle. Who is he? That's John Brown. And this is a great, actually, image of the issue of bleeding Kansas. It was done earlier. It's called tragic prelude. Prelude to what? Prelude to the Civil War, which you can see already the. The Union forces and the confederate forces fighting against each other. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this?"

","We're going to go back in time, and we're going to go all the way to the Middle Ages, and we're going to look at the land tenure system during the Middle Ages. So the land tenure system was called feudalism, and it was based on what's called the thief, right? The thief was an area of land. Now, if we think about in a kingdom, the king owned all the land, all right? But what he did was his special people that helped him. The Lords got access to certain areas of land, and the area of land that the lord would get was called a thief. Okay? Now, as far as I know, there was never a square thief anywhere in Europe. This is just a kind of a depiction of the thief, right? And what we'll see then in the thief is the social order of the Middle Ages, right? And there's a village, and then there's an area of land called the fields of the Lord. And that's where the Lord lives in his manner. Right? And the rest of the land is called commons. Should we be taking notes on this? We heard of the Commons, Boston Common. For now, the way it works is that the Lord has access to the produce of the land, all right? What that means is that he doesn't own the land and he doesn't own the people, but he has rights to the people's labor, okay? And as having rights to the people's labor, what that means is that the people owe him labor in return for his protection, but also being allowed to use the commons to grow their own produce. Right? So they grow grains and sheep and things like that, right? The kind of ideal of the Middle Ages was that the peasants would work in the fields of the Lord and produce. Produce, right? Agricultural goods that they would sell, and then the lord would make money off of that. And in return for that, the commoners would work in the fields for their own goods. Right? Later, what happens is that the lords will figure out they can't make very much money by selling vegetables. So they basically allow the peasants to get money however they want. And then the peasants, instead of paying labor, they pay rent in cash. So that's why you pay rent to the landlord. Okay, you guys are with me. Okay? All right. So now it's an agrarian system, right? And the basis of wealth here is in the land. And because the land is controlled by the Lord, then that means that the Lord controls essentially all the wealth or the other way around. Okay, you guys got this questions? Should we be taking notes on this even though this isn't. I'm sorry, I can't hear. Can you say it again? Should we be taking notes on this? Yes, absolutely. Let me go ahead and move on then. And I'm going to say this is an agrarian system. And even though it's an agrarian system, and most of the produce is agricultural, like sheep, stuff like that, right? And also this system basically is what they would call a subsistence system. And the reason why it's a subsistence system is because people make just enough for everybody to live, right? So you need everybody in the village to grow enough produce for everybody to live. All right. That's why we call it subsistence. You guys with me? Everybody's needed. All right? Okay. Now, even though it's an agrarian system, they still have industry. Okay? The industry, they have to make things, right? Some things that they need to make, like cannons and stuff like that, have to be made up in the hills because that's where the water power is, right? But stuff that you need for the home, like horseshoes and pots and pans and hats and shoes and things like that, are made in the village in a cottage. So what that means is that the peasant will have a cottage, and in the cottage he will have a. Sorry. In the cottage, he will have some kind of a tool to make something. So you might have an anvil, so you can make horseshoes or something like that, right? The example that we're going to use is going to be textiles, right? So the british empire essentially was based on woolen textiles or cotton. So let's say a textile would be something like a sweater. And if you needed a sweater made, you would go to the person in the village who made sweaters, and that person would have a loom. And what you would do is you would tell the person, I want a sweater. And they'd measure you up, and you'd give them some money, and they'd say, okay, come back in three days or four days or whatever, right? And when you come back, then I'll give you your sweater, right? And then the person in the cottage would use the loom to create the sweater. And then when the person came back to get their sweater, they would just get a perfect sweater because it fits them perfectly, because it was made just for them. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay, so that's what we call a cottage industry. Why do we call it cottage industry? Because it happens in the cottage, right? And in the cottage industry, we make a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Small quantity. Because you can only make one thing at a time. One person, one loom makes one thing. Right? High quality because it's made just for you, and reasonable price. Because if it wasn't reasonable, you couldn't afford it. Right. Basically, the industrial output was a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Okay. Now, one thing that we want to notice is that if I'm the peasant that owns the loom that creates the sweater, okay, what do I get in return for making that sweater? Money. Profit. Sorry, money. The profit or the surplus. Right. So you buy the wool and you put your labor in, and the money that's left over, that's what you get to keep. And why do you get keep it? Because you own the loom. I."

","We're going to go to the other side of the world, okay? And what happens, we're going to look at Southeast Asia and this area here. It's. I can't see it because of my stupid thing here. But basically, all this area here, that includes what we today call north and South Vietnam. Cambodia and Laos were French Southeast Asia, or Indochina. French Indochina, right? And it was ruled essentially as a colonial holding of the French until World War Two. All right? And in World War Two, what happened was that close to the end of the war, well, actually, the Japanese invaded Southeast Asia at the beginning of the war, but they allowed the French Vichy regime, the regime that was a puppet to Hitler, they allowed them to continue to rule Vietnam until about a year before the end of the war, at which point then the Japanese ousted the French, okay, and established their own control over all of this area, including north and South Vietnam, okay? When the war was over, the Japanese were evicted, essentially, from Vietnam, from this whole area, which left a power vacuum because the Japanese were evicted. But the French weren't allowed to return until sometime later. And the result was that there was a movement in Vietnam led by a guy named Ho Chi Minh, and he formed a group called the Viet Minh. And the Viet Minh were a nationalist movement in Vietnam. Okay? So now just to talk a little bit about Ho Chi Minh. He was. He was actually. He. He was in France at the time of the Versailles conference, and like a number of other people from colonized areas of the world, he was very excited about Wilson's idea of national self determination. You'll recall that one of the 14 points was that every country should be allowed to choose for itself how it was going to be governed, as long as it was democracy. But he became disappointed because he wrote a letter to Wilson and actually went out and rented a suit and tried to meet Wilson. The letter was never got to Wilson, and he never was able to meet with him. And the outcome of the Treaty of Versailles was to reinforce colonialism rather than to do away with it, as we've already mentioned. And the result of that then, was that Ho Chi Minh decided to go to Moscow to join a group called the Comintern. That's c o m I n t e r n, comintern, and it means communist international, right? The Communist International was a branch of the soviet government that was set up to export communism, right? And after World War two, this communist international was active in many places in the world, including Southeast Asia, with the idea of supporting local independence movements against the colonial powers. But when they did support them. They were supporting them with the idea that they were going to establish communist states, going along with the idea, the marxist idea, that communism can't work anywhere until it actually works everywhere. Right. Okay. So it's kind of. It's very much like what happened in Cuba with Castro, where Ho Chi Minh is nominally a communist and he's receiving support from both Russia and China. But his writings show us that he was more of a nationalist than he was a communist. Right? So, at any rate, Ho Chi Minh and his group, the Viet Minh, step into the void that was created by the withdrawal of the japanese forces and declares a republic in Vietnam. And this republic then, is actually inclusive of all of Vietnam. All right? And when he does that, as basically the declaration of independence of Vietnam was based on the American Declaration of Independence. And when the Vietnamese declared independence, they actually appealed to the president of the United States. I'm not going to read this now, but you should know it's there, right? You can go look at it, right? Appealed to President Truman to support their. Their movement towards independence because he compared it to the american movement towards independence from british colonialism. You guys follow what I'm saying here? Okay, so the problem is going to be this, because Ho Chi Minh has been active in the comintern, and everybody knows that. How is Truman going to respond to him? He's an enemy because he's a communist. Right? Anywhere we see communism, we see an enemy. So even though we can argue that Ho Chi Minh intended to establish some kind of a government independent of the communist bloc in Vietnam, the United States wouldn't refuse to recognize it. And as a result of that, then the United States then supports french colonialism. Okay, the return of french colonialism. The french return. They tried to reestablish their control over this entire area. They're not able to do it because of the kind of guerrilla warfare that's being waged by Ho Chi Minh. So what ends up happening is that the forces of Ho Chi Minh are going to be predominant in the north, and the french colonial forces will be predominant in the south. And there will be a. There will be a kind of a puppet government. There was an emperor, the emperor Bao Dai, who actually wasn't in Vietnam. He was in France, right? But he was, in theory, the ruler of Vietnam. And then there was a president, Ngo Dinh Diem, who was a puppet of the kind of colonialist government, the french colonial government. The problem with no dien Diem was that nobody liked him. The people didn't like him. In fact, he was kind of a brutal guy. He ended up killing or excluding everybody that didn't follow him, agree with him. And there were a lot of different independence movement groups, groups in Vietnam that were not communists. Right, but. Excuse me. Yeah, that were not communists. But Diem alienated them all. And so Diem was never able to fully establish control over the south, and Ho Chi Minh had full control over the north. Okay, so what happens then is that this guerrilla warfare goes on for some period of time. The French are able to convince the Americans that the conflict in Vietnam is similar to the conflict in Korea. And because the United States was fighting an anti communist war in Korea, then the United States was willing and open to providing support for the French in Vietnam, with the idea being that we're going to stop the spread of communism. Remember the Truman doctrine? We're going to stop the spread of communism. In reality, they were not. They were not the same. They weren't driven by the same ideas or the same actors. But from the american point of view, this crusade against communism was almost a holy cause. And one of the things that. Well, I should say it this way. If we go back to the 1950s, if you asked an american what was Saigon, they would tell you it was something to eat. Right. They knew so little about Southeast Asia that they didn't even know that there was a city in Asia called Saigon. Right. And. But when they found out that the Americans were opposing communism there, then Americans were 100% for it. Okay, we need to keep that in mind. Americans were very much on board with the idea of american support for the French in Vietnam. And what happens is that as the war drags on, the french people are going to become weary of this anti colonial war in Vietnam. The war was not. It was not a war between democracy and communism. It was a war between the colonialists and the anti colonialists. Right? And the french people were basically engaged in trying to defend their empire in other places in the world as well, including Algeria, where there's a big war going on there. And the french people start to question whether or not they should even be involved in this. And so the French, they lose their enthusiasm for fighting and reestablishing their colonial control over Vietnam, but the Americans keep supplying things and keep encouraging them to continue the fight, because from the american point of view, it's this bigger view. It's this bigger fight against communism. It's just not a matter of colonialism. So what we really see end up happening is that the United States, rather than being a beacon of independence, becomes the empire, supporting the colonialists. You follow what I'm saying here? Okay, so what happens then is that the Americans keep encouraging the French, and the French keep saying, no, no, no, we don't want to have any more to do with this. And eventually what ends up happening is that there was a big battle in a place called Dien Bien phu, which is here. And the Vietnamese roundly defeat the French and their army at Dien Bien Phu. And then shortly after that, there are peace talks in Geneva, and the French and the Vietnamese agree to an end to the war. Okay, and the end of the war, basically, the outcome is going to be that the French are going to withdraw. They're going to divide Vietnam into two. They're going to divide Vietnam into two. The north will be ruled by Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh. The south will be ruled by Ngo Dinh Diem and his followers. And that in 1956. This is 1954, right. In 1956, there will be elections, and whoever wins the elections will rule all of Vietnam. Okay? So the election essentially would be between Ho Chi Minh and no Dinh Diem. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, well, here's the problem. The problem is that Ho Chi Minh is very popular throughout Vietnam. He's kind of seen as the George Washington of Vietnam. And he. If he is a communist, he really downplays it, right? He'll say, yeah, well, we're going to be communists, but maybe not for 100 years. It might take us 100 years to get there, right? And so people in the south are not afraid of. Of Ho Chi Minh because they don't see communism the same way Americans see communism. Right? And so the reality is that if they actually did hold elections in 1956, that Ho Chi Minh would win. And so the United States saw that as a real danger. And what ends up happening is that the United States convinces no Dinh diem to stop the elections."

","We're going to talk about World War two today, and we can't really talk about World War two without talking about World War one, because a lot of the events that were set in motion by the Treaty of Versailles and World War one are going to be contributing factors to World War two. So some people argue that the time between World War one and World War two was just a pause in the same war. I disagree with that because, I mean, yeah, there is an aspect of that that is correct, but there's also the fact that World War two really wasn't one war. It was really three wars. It was a war between the western allies and Japan and a war between the western allies and Germany and a war between the Soviet Union and Germany. So really three different wars happening at the same time. All right, questions? Comments? So let's go now and think about, well, what are the events that lead up to this? And the first thing we have to say is that, if you will recall, american foreign policy always was isolationist, that the united states didn't get involved in world affairs. The only time that Americans would get involved in world affairs would be if its trading relationships were threatened. And it's pretty much what we saw with World War one. But at the end of the war, even though the Americans won, most people in all of the countries that had fought world War one believed it was a huge mistake, and the world kind of fell into an emotional depression after the war. It was an era when people just thought that the whole thing had been a massive waste, and Americans definitely felt that way. So Americans didn't want to continue their involvement in world affairs. They wanted to go back into isolationism. And they did, actually. And one of the things that will happen politically, we see that Roosevelt beat Hoover, and for a period of time between 1932 and 1938, Congress was controlled by Democrats. So we had the Congress and the presidency controlled by Democrats. But then after 19, I think it was actually 1936, the Republicans took control of the Congress, and they were very much against the idea of getting involved in another war. And so they passed laws that committed the United States to neutrality. But the United States was not going to get involved in any wars. And most people were actually on board with this. Most people thought that was a fine idea. Roosevelt, the president, actually wasn't on board with it because he saw basically two different problems happening. One was that american interests were being threatened in the Pacific, and the other was that democracy itself was being threatened in Europe. And Wilson. Excuse me, sorry. Roosevelt was very much a wilsonian diplomat, meaning that he believed in missionary diplomacy, that the United States had a mission to extend and protect democracy. And so when we look then at what was going on in the Pacific, as I'll kind of describe to you here in a minute, we can see that America had economic interests that were being threatened in the Pacific, and also American had ideological interests that were being threatened in Europe. And Roosevelt believed that the United States would eventually have to get involved in a war. All right, well, we'll just leave it there, except to say that he started to make arrangements for that, even while the congress was passing laws for american neutrality. And you can. You can actually watch reading the book about how the United States kind of comes out of that, that isolationist shell even before Pearl harbor. But one thing that we need to understand, it's a link between the Japanese and the Germans, and that there was a treaty, an agreement between Germany, Japan, and Italy called the tripartite Pact. And the treaty was really aimed at the Soviet Union, because both Germany and Japan saw the Soviet Union as a threat, and Italy was on board because they were allied with Germany. Right. But the consequence of that was that everybody knew that if the United States went to war with Japan or if Japan went to war with the United States, then Germany would also declare war on the United States. Okay, so there was. This is something that is out in the open. Everybody knows this is going to happen. All right? Questions? Comments? Okay. All right. So now, in the Pacific, one of the things that had happened in the Pacific was that Japan was a rising industrial nation. Japan had forced industrialization on the end part of the 19th century, but Japan was an industrial power, like the british industrial powers, meaning that it had a powerful industrial plant, but they didn't have access to resources, and they had to get those resources elsewhere. Japan acted like the european imperialists and sought control over different places in Asia where they could gain their resources. But with that power, the rising industrial power, they were also becoming a rising military power. And really their only rival in the Pacific was the United States. The United States was by this time the world's greatest industrial power. And the United States had interest in the. In Asia, particularly in the philippine islands, because the United States owned the philippine islands. So the difference between Japan and the United States, industrially or economically, was that Japan did not have control of its resources, and the United States did, because the United States had all of its resources on the north american continent. And so that made Japan dependent on imperialism. And one of the things that they did then, as a result of the Great Depression, the military took control of the government and said, well, we're going to supply our industry with resources by invading other countries. And so they invade Manchuria, they invade China, and then they set out on, of course, their plan, their stated plan was to conquer essentially all of Asia, right, to use it as their kind of empire for contributing to their industrial plant. All right, so the Japanese are threatening in Asia, and Roosevelt, as president, realizes this is a threat to american interests in the Philippines. And so the tensions are going to, in the 1930s will be rising between the United States and Japan. And eventually what will happen is that the United States will declare an embargo against Japan. And what that means is that Japan can't buy goods from the United States. But the problem is that the japanese economy depends on goods from the United States, wood and steel in particular. And so if the United States stops selling those, those resources to Japan, that means they have to get them somewhere else. And so what will happen then is that Japan will come up with a plan. They'll make a decision that they're going to accomplish one massive offensive throughout the Pacific and take over essentially all of the Pacific, and then they're going to declare that to the world as a fait accompli. Keeping in mind now that at this point, the western powers have demonstrated that they're not really willing to enforce the punitive aspects of the treaty of Versailles. You guys follow me here. Questions? And so the Japanese think, well, you know, the Americans are in depression, and the other countries aren't really willing to back up their threats that were made with the treaty of Versailles. So we'll just do this, and we'll present it to the world as a fait un compli. And that means a done deal. And that after that, we'll get away with it. Essentially, nobody will respond. You guys follow me here. But they were afraid that just, they didn't know, and they were afraid that the United States might respond. And they knew that the United States fleet was at Pearl harbor, and so they decided, as part of their offensive, that they would bomb Pearl harbor with the idea that if they bombed Pearl harbor and crippled the American Pacific fleet, that would discourage the Americans from getting involved. Okay? So as part of their expansion in Asia, they took over basically everything that's inside the green here. Right. And at the same time, they bombed Pearl harbor, and they did actually cripple the american fleet. But that didn't discourage the Americans. It enraged the Americans. Right. And so what the attack on Pearl harbor did was it changed american public opinion from isolationism and neutrality to being totally in favor of war against the Japanese, and at the same time, it brought Germany into the war against the United States. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So are you supposed to be sharing your screen? Am I not sharing the screen? No, I'm sorry. I don't. I always do that. Why do I always do that? Yeah, I heard in the green, and I was like, we're supposed to be looking at something right now, right? Okay. Yeah. Well, hopefully you were learning a lot from just my talking, but actually, this is what we were looking at, the map here. So the Japanese have. Have expanded throughout this area. That's inside the green here. You guys get what I'm saying? And that includes the Philippines. So the Japanese took over the Philippines, but the strategy, the gamble that they took was that if they bombed Pearl harbor and crippled the american fleet, that would keep the United States out of war. But in reality, it had exactly the opposite effect, because Americans were enraged. And so Americans changed their attitude from one of neutrality to one in favor of a war against Japan. And at the same time, because of the tripartite pact, Germany declares war on the United States. Okay, you guys are with me. So now the United States is involved in two wars, one in Europe and one in the Pacific. All right, questions? Comments? With a Pearl harbor, like, how big was the. Like, how many ships were there? How much damage the actual Navy did they intend to do? Was it, like, more morale, or was it more trying to do damage to the navy? No, actually, most. Most of the american fleet was there, and most of the american fleet was destroyed. And so the United States really did take a big hit at Pearl harbor in terms of its military capability in the Pacific. The counterbalance to that was that the United States had a very efficient industrial plant that could be quickly fit to produce war material. So the United States could. Even though they had. There were a number of ships that were destroyed, Americans could actually produce ships faster than the Japanese could destroy them. Right. There was a period of time when the United States was actually launching a destroyer every day. Right? Do you follow what I'm saying here? And so because of that, even though the fleet was crippled, the United States could overcome that. And one of the advantages that the United States had over Japan was that their industrial plant wasn't. That wasn't big enough to do that. So when the United States destroyed japanese ships, they couldn't replace them. It took too long for them to replace them. So the american fleet kept growing. Actually, the american war machine kept growing. Bigger and bigger and bigger over the course of the war, as the Japanese. As the japanese ability to make war kept decreasing."

","What was the focus of american politics during this period of the era of good feelings? And it's called, in your book, I think they call it the national consensus. And otherwise it's also called the american system. And it consists of three different policies. One, that there should be a national bank. Two, that there should be protective tariffs, and three, that there should be infrastructure. Okay. That they should spend money on infrastructure. So we're going to talk about what, what each of the three of these things is, and then we're going to look at how they affected the different regions. Okay? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so the first one, then the national bank. What would be the purpose of having a national bank? We talked about this earlier. We talked about that Hamilton wanted the national bank and Jefferson was against it, but they ended up with a national bank. But why would the national bank be important in the american system? What does it do? International credit. Right. It actually stabilizes the currency. All right? And so it makes american, it makes american credit good. And it makes american money worth something. Right? The national bank actually enhances America's worth on the world market. Okay. Does that make sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? Protective tariffs are, you know that, you know what a tariff is, right? Somebody tell me, tariff. What's a tariff? It's like a tax you pay on imports. Exactly. It's exactly right. Tax on imports. Right. And so you get a start to Joe attacks on imports. And what's the purpose of attacks on imports? To try to make it so that you try to buy or manufacture in the states rather than importing it, maybe. Okay, that's, that's actually right when we talk about protective tariffs. Now, let me just say this. At this time, the governments of almost all the countries made their money by tariffs. So the United States actually didn't tax the people, but instead what they did was they taxed imports, and that's how the federal government got its money. Okay? And that was true of a number of other countries at the same time. But protective tariffs are different because the purpose of a protective tariff is to protect american industry. And the reason why that's important is we look at before the revolution, the British had basically forbidden the colonies to manufacture, okay? And the reason why was because the purpose of the colony was to produce raw materials to the manufacturing plants in England who could then turn them into finished goods that could be sold back to the colonies. And that meant then when the United States becomes independent, it's actually behind in terms of industry compared to the British. And what that meant was that the British could actually produce and sell goods in America for less than american manufacturers could make them. Right? You guys are all following me here. So let me just give you a kind of a thought experiment here, which is not, it's not real. I'm just making up some numbers to demonstrate, right? But let's say that you have british shoes and you have american shoes. Okay? The British can make a good quality pair of shoes and sell it in the United States at a profit for $3. Right? But the american manufacturers of shoes, it actually, their shoes that they make are not quite as good quality. And in order for them to make a profit, they have to sell it at $5. Right. So you are the consumer and you go to the shoe store and you want to buy shoes and you see the good quality british shoes for $3 and the not quite so good quality american shoes for $5. Which one are you going to buy? You're going to buy the british shoes. Right. Okay. So what happens then is that the United States imposes a tax on the import of british shoes, and that tax is a four dollar tax. Right. Or a $3 tax. Okay. So what that means then is that now you go to the shoe store to buy shoes and you see the good quality british shoes for $6, but the almost as good quality american shoes for $5. Which one are you going to buy? At this point, it makes sense to be patriotic. Right. Okay. And so the purpose of these tariffs then is to support american industry. And this is going to actually be one of the most successful policies that the United States enacts because by the beginning of the 20th century, the United States is the most powerful industrial country in the world. Okay. All right. So we'll leave it at that. Questions, comments about this? Okay. Does everybody know what infrastructure is? Or anybody? I mean, you're talking about infrastructure now, infrastructure bills. You're talking about trying to get through Congress. What is infrastructure? Like farms and buildings and stuff like that. Actually, we're. It's not really that. The stuff that connects those. Right. So it's roads and canals and airports. They didn't do airports at the time. Right. But roads and canals and things like that. Now why would that be important? Well, the reason why is because America is divided by mountains. And in order to get goods from. We already talked about this. In order to get goods from the west to the east, you have to bring it around the entire continent. You have to bring it down to New Orleans and ship it to the east. Right. And so if you could build roads and canals from the west to the east. That would make it easier for people in the west to get their products to the east. Do you guys follow, I'm saying here? So now those are the three, the three policies. What I'm going to do next is I'm going to, I know you guys probably don't like this and I'm not crazy about it either, but I'm going to try to make a little whiteboard here so that I can, we can kind of consider these policies. Okay. In terms of region. I'm going to make a table. Right. And let me see if I can figure out how to do this. The table is going to be, we're going to have north, south and west. So now we're going to make three rows. National bank, protective tariffs, infrastructure. So now having said all that we said, right, we want to think about, okay, the purpose of the national bank is to do what? Create one, like one pole bank for, or, I'm sorry. Yeah, but what is the reason for it? Why do we want that stabilized currency? Okay, so, so who, who does that actually help if you're in the north, is it, is it a good idea to have a national bank because they want to trade? Yeah, it's a good idea. So it's good. How can I, how can I make it good? What's a good symbol? How about let's put a plus sign, right? Right. A plus sign. It's good. Okay. And, but in the south, is it going to be good for you to have a national bank? Keep in mind, the economy of the south is export agriculture. Their economy is not a trading economy, it's export agriculture. So is it going to be good to have a national bank for the south, for the people of the south? Is it going to be good or bad or neither? It's probably going to be neither. Right. It's not going to affect them at all very much. All right. So we just put a kind of a minus there. It's not a minus, but that's, that's just a kind of a, it's, it's a, it's a neutral sign. Okay. And then what about the west? Is the national bank going to help or hurt the west? Out of the three, a negative for the west. Okay, you're actually right. Why is that? The reason why is because let's think about the economies of the north, south and west. Right. The north is a trading, commercial economy, industrializing economy. The south is plantation agriculture, basically a kind of almost feudal economy. And the west, the major I mean, most of the economy in the west is based on farming, but in order to farm, you need what? Land. Right. And so what happens is that the west, the biggest, the biggest commercial interest in the west or the biggest economic interest in the west is land speculation, buying and selling real estate essentially. Right. Okay. So now if, if the national bank stabilizes the credit markets by making it more difficult to get credit, okay, you guys should really be paying attention to this. Okay, so if it makes it more difficult to get credit, what effect does that have on the real estate market? It makes it harder to get credit. Right. So it makes it harder to buy things. And because of that, because the major economic activity in the west is based on real estate speculation, how is that going to affect the west? Is it going to be good or bad? It's going to be bad, right. Okay. So here we have the national bank. It helps the north. It really doesn't affect the south that much and it hurts the west. All right, you guys got that? Now let's take a look at protective tariffs. What is the purpose of protective tariffs? Tax on imports. And what is the purpose of it? Protect american industry. Protect american industry. Right. So is that going to help or hurt the north? It'll help out the north because they're a trading economy, right. So it'll help the north. What about the south? They're, like you said, they're mostly an export economy and there's tariffs on exports as well. So it might hurt them a little bit. Right. It doesn't hurt them a little bit. It hurts them a lot. Okay. At least from their point of view. So we're going to put two negatives there, right, because, oh, I'm sorry, that's not how we do it. We do it like this. Xx sorry about that. Okay. The reason why is because just like you said, if the Americans raise tariffs on british imports, then the British are going to raise tariffs on american exports. And the export, the major export of the United States is cotton. Their major buyer is England. And so if what that means then is that they raise, they raise tariffs on american exports, that means that the southerners aren't getting as much money, right. You guys are following me here. But then the other half of that is that the south doesn't manufacture. So that means they have to import things that are manufactured and so they end up having to pay tariffs on the things that they're importing. So on the one hand they're not making as much money from their exports and on the other hand, they're paying more money for their imports. You guys follow what I'm saying? And this is why the south is going to be dead set against tariffs. It's going to be one of the major issues that leads to the civil war. Okay, you guys are with me. So. And then what about the west? How does the, how do tariffs affect the west? Kind of just a neutral. Yeah, it's a neutral. You're right. I think that's, that's right. Okay. So then let's take a look at, uh, infrastructure. What is the purpose of infrastructure again? Create roads and pathways to help trade and get stuff through the states. Right. To get things from the west to the east. Right. So where do they go in the east? Is it going to help or hurt the north? It'll help the north with their trade economy. They want to get as much goods out as possible. Exactly. It's going to, it's going to help the north is how's it going to affect the south? It's not really, because the south isn't manufacturing anything and they're not exporting anything to the north. Right. So we're just kind of a negative. They're kind of a neutral there. And then it will help the west. Right. Because the west can get their goods to the east easier. You guys follow I'm saying here? So now when we take a look at this chart that I just made, right, the national bank helps the north, doesn't really affect the south and it hurts the west. Protective tariffs help the north. They really hurt the south, at least from their point of view. And it really doesn't affect the west. Infrastructure helps the north, doesn't really affect the south and it helps the west. So, so what, what do we gain from looking at this chart, at this table? What kind of understanding can we help the others? Everything helps the north. The south was really unhappy. Right. The south is very unhappy. Right. Because the south, now here's the reason why, just so you know, and you really need to keep this in mind, and that is that the population of the north is growing rapidly, but the population of the south is essentially stagnant. It's not really growing. Right. Population of the west is also growing. Right. But the reason why the south is getting left out is because there's more people in the north than there are in the south. What effect would that have on the national government? They have more power in Congress. More. Which part of Congress? In the House of Representatives. Exactly. And that's where most of the laws are introduced. Okay. And so the south is, will come to believe that maybe it's not even in their interest to be in the United States. And this is where we start to see a sentiment grow in the south towards what we'll call secession. Okay, division, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about that?"

","What was the major outcome of the mexican american war? What did the United States win? Texas and California. Texas and California and all the. All the area in between. It was a really enormous area of land that the United States won. Now, just keep that in mind, and let me ask you this other question. If you're thinking about us politics in the 1840s, what is the big issue? Free states or slave states? Right. Slave versus free. Okay. So now these two ideas are going to come together after the mexican american war, because now the United States has a whole. An enormous amount of territory that they need to figure out how they're going to use it. And one of the things that happens when Congress addressed the issue was there was a man from Pennsylvania named David Wilmot, and he introduced a. We'll call it the Wilmot proviso. And what it really is is something that was tacked on to a bill that would incorporate the newly gained territories into the United States. But what the Wilmot proviso called for was the abolition, or the. Well, I guess we should say abolition. Not really, but that the new territory that was gained could not be slave territory. Okay. Now, why would that be a problem? Let's take a look at the map here. Right? You can't see the screen. I'm sorry. I do that more often than not. Okay, so let's take a look at the map here. And this is the territory. Texas, New Mexico, Utah, and California. Actually, Texas was really already part of the United States. Right. And so we added all of this new territory here. Right. But what would be a reason why people would think that this territory should be open to slavery? Where had the United States. Because it's below the. That line. The. Okay, yeah. The Missouri compromise line. So if you guys remember the Missouri compromise, the Missouri compromise was where the Ohio river meets the Mississippi river, and all the way west, slavery was forbidden north of that territory, but not south. But if you'll recall, United States didn't own any territory south of that. It was all part of the spanish empire. Right? So now it's now part of the United States, and it's south of the territory. Right. Why can't the United States. Why can't slavery exist in these new territories? Okay. And this becomes a huge question. This becomes a political issue that people can't. People can't. The Congress can't move forward with incorporating this territory because they can't. The Congress is broken, divided over the issue of slavery."

","What we're going to talk about actually has to do with civil rights strategy, right? And the reason why I say that, and we look at it this way, is because if we go back to. Whenever we think about the civil rights movement, we think about it beginning with the Brown versus Board of Education decision, excuse me, in 1954. But actually, civil rights, a movement towards civil rights, has really always been part of american culture, and particularly after the. After reconstruction, when Jim Crow. Jim Crow laws start to be established, there's going to be a movement to try to bring about equality and to restore the rights of people who are what we call disenfranchised. Just so you know what that means. Disenfranchised means they can't vote. Right? The franchise is to vote. So to be disenfranchised means that you can't vote, which means that you're. You're not really a part of a democracy. If you can't vote. Right, you're left out. Okay? So one of the things that happened during the Jim Crow era, after reconstruction, was that many laws were passed to restrict the rights of black blacks, to restrict their civil rights and their political rights. And so, starting as far back as the 1870s, there were movements toward trying to bring about civic equality and political rights for black people, okay? And among these groups was the formation of a new group called the NAACP, or the National association for the Advancement of Colored People, which is still a very powerful organization today. And they employed a strategy, a strategy of litigation. So the idea being that they would sue in federal court. So, for example, the way that that worked would be that if you came across a law that you believe to be unconstitutional, then you would get somebody to deliberately break the law so that they could be arrested and it could be tried in court, and they could appeal all the way up and eventually to the Supreme Court. And the expectation was that the federal courts would overturn the law, okay? Because they were unconstitutional. Most of them. You guys follow me here. Questions? Comments? Okay. What happened was, in one case, there was a man in Louisiana. His name was Homer Plessy. He was a light skinned mulatto, which meant that he could pass for white. And there was a law that restricted the rights of blacks by saying that blacks had to ride in different cars on the train from whites, okay? And so the NAACP decided to test this law. And Homer Plessy bought a ticket to ride on the white car. And then once he was on the white car, he announced that he was a black man. Because remember the one drop rule, right? And the result was that he was arrested and tried and convicted, right, for breaking the law. But the case was appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, what the supreme court decided was that as long as the railroad provided equal facilities for blacks, then they were then to keep them separate was okay, was it was constitutional. And so this is the. The decision Plessy versus Ferguson handed down in 1896. Basically, what it says is that we consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that he enforced separation of the two races stamps to colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it. That's the opinion of the court, and I'd like for you to go back and read the dissent. Okay. At some point. I'm not going to read it to you now, but the main thing that comes out of this is that the concept of separate but equal is now cemented in law. And what that does is it makes it Jim Crow laws much more difficult to overturn. You follow? Sam questions, comments about this, and this is the effect of equal. Separate but equal. All right, separate but equal. You would assume both of the cars to look like this, or both of the cars to look like this, but separate but equal ends up like this. And it's just not in the railroads. It's in everything. Public accommodations, it's in school systems everywhere. The idea that there are equal facilities is a lie, that the facilities are never equal. But because this has been endorsed, in a way, by the Supreme Court, this is the situation that exists for another 50 years or so, right? But you guys will recall that World War two was a sea change in the United States in the topic of civil rights, among other things. And you'll remember back 100 years ago when we started this class, and you watched that movie, Los Meneros. And in that movie, the Hispanics didn't start to get rights until after World War two. But after World War two, because they had participated in defending America, they insisted that they be treated equally. And so that's when we start to see them make gains in terms of civil rights. And it's the same thing with black people. Black people, many people. Black people fought in World War two, even though the armed services were segregated. And the. And when they came back, the expectation was that they would be treated equally with whites, but of course, they weren't. Okay, so there's this kind of sea change in the attitude of people that have been left out that they won't accept this inequality any longer. And this comes to head, I guess you could say, based on a court case that starts in Topeka, Kansas. Now, I want you guys to, at some point today, go find a map of the United States and notice where Kansas is. It's not in the south. You guys get what I'm saying? But. But they had segregation laws, and the law said that black children had to go to black schools and white children had to go to white schools, right? And of course, no white person would want to enroll their kid in a black school. But black people were forced often to send their kids to school farther away from home than they needed to because there was a perfectly good white school right there in their neighborhood. And this was the case with. I can't remember the name of the guy. His name was Brown. His last name was Mister Brown. Right? But anyway, Mister Brown had a daughter that he wanted to enroll in the public school, and they told him that he had to enroll her in a school that was farther away from where he lived than the nearest white school. So he attempted to enroll his daughter in the white school and was denied. And at that point, then he sued board of education. And that worked its way up through the Supreme Court until the Supreme Court overturned Plessy versus Ferguson, basically essentially saying, and again, you should go back and read this later, but essentially saying, we conclude that in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, as was every other facility that was separate. Right? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? So, so Brown versus the board of education overturns the doctrine that is. That is upholding Jim Crow. So that's the Jim. That's the end of Jim Crow, right? Wrong. And the reason why is because even though the Supreme Court ruled that this particular law was unconstitutional, that didn't affect the thousands of other laws throughout the country that were. That that's called for or demanded. Separate but equal. So, so, so, for example, in. Let's say, in. In Louisiana, or let's say this. Let's say in brown versus Board of Education, Supreme Court said that the school policy that wouldn't allow Mister Brown to enroll his daughter in the neighborhood school was unconstitutional. So that law was overturned. But the same law in Wichita, Kansas, wasn't overturned, because even though it's unconstitutional, that hasn't been challenged. You follow what I'm saying? And so this. This. Sorry. This strategy of the NAACP to challenge segregation laws or Jim Crow laws in court, is successful on the, on an individual basis, but it's, it's inefficient and effective essentially in the bigger picture, because in order to overturn all the Jim Crow laws, you'd have to challenge each one in court. And there's thousands of different laws in thousands of different jurisdictions. And so even though you may win every case, it's not possible to try at so many cases that it has a significant effect."

","While the United States entry into the war was delayed, total war's brutal reality had already gripped Europe. Total war, a defining characteristic of World War one, signified the mobilization of entire societies for the war effort. Unlike previous conflicts, where civilian populations were largely spared, total war blurred the lines between soldiers and civilians. The concept wasn't entirely new. The American Civil War, particularly General Sherman's scorched earth march through Georgia, offered a glimpse into this new kind of warfare. Sherman's strategy aimed to cripple the Confederacy's war machine by destroying civilian infrastructure and resources, ultimately forcing their surrender. This foreshadowed the tactics employed on a grander scale in World War one. Trench warfare, another innovation of the American Civil War, became a hallmark of World War one. Confederate General Robert E. Lee's use of trenches around Richmond to slow the Union advance served as a blueprint for the extensive trench networks that dominated the western front. In essence, total war transformed world War one into a struggle between entire nations, not just opposing armies. Every facet of society, civilian and military alike, became a cog in the war machine. British civilians toiled in factories producing munitions, while german civilians rationed food supplies to support the troops. This complete mobilization blurred the distinction between innocent bystanders and active participants, a stark contrast to previous warfare. This unprecedented level of national commitment would define the brutal and devastating nature of world War one. Let's consider the concept of total war and why it would present unique challenges for the United States. Unlike nations where a strong sense of unified ethnicity and identity exists, the United States is a nation of immigrants. Most Americans have ancestral ties to european nations, making it difficult to adopt a stance where all Americans are unified against a single enemy. Our identities are inherently intertwined with our heritage. Even today, many Americans proudly trace their ancestry to nations like Norway. This diverse composition creates tension with the concept of total war, where national identity becomes a key component of the conflict. Consequently, America struggles with the very foundation of total war. Unfortunately, this led to a negative outcome, a backlash against fellow Americans. Driven by fear, individuals with german surnames were targeted, sometimes subjected to violence or ostracism. In response, many people with german heritage were compelled to anglicize their names to avoid scrutiny. This phenomenon highlights how divisions can be manufactured without even relying on racial differences. If you observe british, french, and german individuals side by side, visual distinctions may not be apparent until they engage in conversation. Nonetheless, a sense of otherness can be artificially created based on nationality. This demonstrates how fear can be a powerful tool used to sow, discord, and pit Americans against each other under the guise of defending against the other. This world War one recruitment poster destroy this mad brute exemplifies the use of fear and dehumanization to promote enlistment. The poster depicts a monstrous ape like figure wearing a spiked helmet, a clear reference to german soldiers steamrolling across a devastated Europe. This imagery portrays Germany as a barbaric force threatening to engulf the civilized world, symbolized by America's shores. In the giant's hand, we see a woman in distress, likely meant to represent american womanhood, vulnerability and the need for protection. The poster exploits traditional gender roles, appealing to men's sense of duty to safeguard their loved ones. The poster's effectiveness lies in its manipulation of emotions. By portraying Germans as subhuman beasts, it dehumanizes the enemy and creates a stark distinction between us and them. This facilitates the act of killing, turning soldiers into exterminators rather than taking human lives. The message is clear. Germans are not worthy of human compassion, making their destruction justifiable. This approach backfired to an extent. While it encouraged some to enlist, it also fueled animosity towards German Americans within the United States. This highlights the dangers of dehumanization in wartime propaganda, a tactic that can fracture societies even as it seeks to unify them. Tsarist Russia's struggles in world War one proved to be a catalyst for revolution. Early defeats and economic hardship, including food shortages, fueled public discontent with the monarchy. This vulnerability was exacerbated by the ottoman empires entry into the war, which effectively severed Russias access to crucial supplies from the outside world. In March 1917, the frustrations culminated in the first revolution. The tsar was overthrown and a provisional government led by Alexander Kerensky established a liberal democracy. Sadly, Kerensky's government proved to be short lived. By November 1917, October, according to the old russian calendar, a second revolution led by the Bolsheviks, the Communist Party, toppled Kerensky's government. We'll discuss the Bolsheviks in more detail when we explore the Cold War. The existence of a liberal, democratic Russia, even for a brief period, was significant for the United States. President Wilson's reluctance to join the war stemmed partly from his aversion to an alliance with with the tsarist monarchy. A democratic Russia might have been viewed more favorably by the US, potentially altering the course of the war. Germany, sensing an opening with Russia's collapse, sought to capitalize on the instability. Their strategy involved two key steps. First, they planned a massive offensive on the western front, intending to overwhelm the allies. Then they would shift their forces eastward to consolidate control over Russia. This change in focus also allowed them to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. Believing that even if the United States declared war, american troops could not be mobilized quickly enough to make a difference. It was a risky gamble and one that would ultimately fail. To further hedge their bets, german foreign Minister Arthur Zimmerman sent a coded telegram to Mexican President Benustiano Carranza. The telegram proposed an alliance against the United States should they enter the war. It also promised Mexico the return of territories lost to the mexican american war a significant portion of the southwestern United States. Though Carranza did not respond, the telegram was intercepted and decoded by the British. Its contents were then strategically leaked to the american press. This move decisively shifted american public opinion in favor of war. The perception of german aggression on american soil, combined with the recent fall of the tsarist regime, made Wilsons hesitation untenable. Amidst calls for retaliation, the United States declared war on Germany. American troops proved vital to the allied cause. The balance of power, previously teetering on the edge, significantly shifted with the introduction of fresh american forces. The Allies began pushing back against Germany, who eventually recognized the futility of their position and negotiated a peace armistice before the Allies invaded their borders.

","Winfield Scott establishes american administration over Mexico City, and then they start to negotiate a treaty. The problem is there's no government to negotiate with. And so eventually what ends up happening is that Mexicans are able to form a government, and they do start to negotiate with the. With the Americans. All right, in the meantime, in the United States, there's a group of people, many people, actually, who say, well, we've already got Mexico. Why don't we just keep it right? And this is what's known as the all Mexico idea. The all Mexico idea is the idea that since we've already taken it, we might as well keep it right. But there were a number of people who were in favor of that, but there were also a number of people who were against it. And it really kind of brings together two very different groups who are opposed to the idea of all Mexico. One of them is the liberals, like Abraham Lincoln, who say that american conquest of territory goes against the american ideal. American ideals don't include conquest. American ideals include liberty and equality and those sorts of things. And also, there's another group led by this guy, John Calhoun. You remember, we talked about him briefly last week when we said that he was the kind of face of southern white supremacy and states rights, and he thought that adding Mexicans to the United States would weaken american democracy because democracy was only for white people. He actually said this in the Congress, essentially, right, that only white people are able to practice democracy. And therefore, if we add all these non white people to the United States, that will weaken the United States. Okay, so we have two very different points of view, but both of them against. Against the annexation of Mexico. All right, guys, with any questions, comments about this? All right, so the. Polk had sent a diplomat, his name was Nicholas Tristram, to Mexico to negotiate the treaty. He had a falling out with Trist and eventually fired Trist. But in the meantime, Trist had actually gained the trust of the mexican government. So he went ahead and negotiated a treaty. The treaty was negotiated a little town outside of Mexico called Guadalupe Hidalgo. And they. They actually came to an agreement on this date, February 2, 1848. Right? And the agreement, Mark, made the border between the United States at the Rio Bravo. And then there, this was the border that was defined. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about this? So that's where we see the creation of most of our southern border. All right, there was one thing that comes about after this, and that is that, if you'll recall, the reason why Polk wanted to add California was why trade with Asia all right, so let's think about this for a minute. Once we get all the goods from Asia to San Francisco, or actually Sacramento, which is connected to San Francisco by river, right? Once we get all the goods from Asia to Sacramento, then what? Where is the population of the United States located? It's all back here in the east. So how are you going to get goods from California back east? What kind of a technology would allow that? Trains. Exactly. A railroad. Okay, so now there's a number of different proposals in Congress about building railroads, okay? To connect the west coast with the east. And one of them was to connect Chicago to Seattle. One of them was to connect Chicago to Sacramento. That's the Union Pacific. And one of them was to connect New Orleans to Los Angeles. Okay? And the problem with create with building a railroad from New Orleans to Los Angeles was that you couldn't build a railroad through this territory. It was occupied by hostile natives and too rugged, too mountainous. And so the United States determined that the best place to build this railroad would be through this territory. But this territory still actually belonged to Mexico. Okay? So what happened was, in 1853, Americans sent a man named Gadsden to Mexico to negotiate with Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, who's once again president for the last time, actually, the sale of this area. And Santa Ana vigorously said, no, we will not sell this territory. And Gadsden then put out the word in Mexico City, reminding them, well, do you remember what happened last time? You said that you wouldn't sell us territory. Right. Be shame if something happened, right? And so they sold the territory, and that's how we added that last little bit of the southern border. All right, so that's then the creation of the southern border and the war with Mexico. All right, questions? Comments?"

","You guys remember when we talked about the Versailles treaty and the United States rejected the Versailles treaty? Does anybody remember why? Because Congress, it took away Congress's power to start a war, and they could just go, war. Okay, so the United States never joined the League of Nations, right? But after World War two, the United States actually did create a new organization called the United nations, and it was based on the same idea as Wilson's idea of collective security. And the idea, then again, was that if it's collective security, that means everybody's on the same side. And if one country attacks another country, it's the same as attacking everybody. And that's to prevent. Prevent a small country from trying to attack another country, because then they'll be at war with everybody. That's the idea. Right? Okay, so what happens is that, well, let's just take a look here. This is Korea. Korea had been dominated by the Japanese since the beginning of the 20th century. And after world War two, Korea becomes independent, but it ends up being divided between the Soviets and the Americans, okay? And so the result was, instead of creating one Korea, after World War two, there were actually two Koreas, okay? And one of them established a soviet style communist regime, and the other one established an american style capitalist regime. And that's really the same way as it is now. Okay, but what happened was that the North Koreans, actually, the Soviets and the North Koreans thought that it would be possible for them to overrun the korean peninsula and just establish one Korea as a communist country. So now this is an example of soviet expansionism, right? That the Soviets want to expand communism. And the way that they're going to do it is by force in this particular case. Right? So the Soviets invade, or actually, the North Koreans invade South Korea, and the south korean military is pushed all the way back to this little tiny area right here. Right? But what happens is that because South Korea is in the United Nations, President Truman goes to the United nations and asks the United nations to declare war. And they do, right? And then Truman goes to Congress and says, hey, we're at war. We need money, right? Okay, so that sounds a lot like what the Republicans were afraid of when they talked about the League of Nations, doesn't it? Because the United States didn't declare war. It was actually the United nations that declared war, and the United States was dragged into it by this treaty obligation. You guys are with me. Okay, well, anyway, so that turned out to be true. But at any rate, what happens is that the United States does then go to war in Korea, and the commander of the US forces in the Pacific, Douglas MacArthur, who was a great hero of the war, many people thought of him as. As one of the two major generals of the war. He was Yemen. Eisenhower. Right. And MacArthur created, engineered a strategy of a massive amphibious landing here at Incheon, which cut the lines of the North Koreans, and they were forced to withdraw. And so then the question is that once the North Koreans had recrossed the line, MacArthur said, well, we should go ahead and just take over Korea, and then we won't have this threat of communism to worry about anymore. The kind of thing that would have caused some caution was that the Chinese had threatened that if the United States invaded North Korea, then the Chinese would oppose that invasion. But the Americans were not too concerned about the Chinese, because the Chinese had been fighting a civil war that had just ended. And so they were weak, essentially. They thought they had more manpower than they knew what to do with, but they were essentially militarily weak. So the Americans were not that concerned about China. And they did eventually convince Truman that, to go ahead and invade North Korea. And they did actually take almost all of North Korea. You can see this purple line here. But at that point, then the Chinese did invade, and they again pushed the Americans and their allies back. And eventually what ended up happening was that they negotiated an armistice. One of the things that happened as part of this incident was that when the Chinese invaded North Korea, MacArthur and his generals proposed to Truman that they should just drop nuclear bombs on China. But Truman, by now, or actually by now, the Soviet Union had their own nuclear weapons. And Truman realized that it was no longer possible to, to fight a total war. You could no longer use whatever means you had at your disposal, because if you started a nuclear war, the outcome would be the destruction of everything or could be. Right. And so Truman basically said, no, you can't use nuclear weapons. And in response to that, MacArthur, who's general of the army, is going to publicly criticize Truman. Okay, what would be the problem with the general of the army publicly criticizing the president? Isn't the president supposed to be the commander in chief of the army? That's exactly right. The president. So he was publicly criticizing his boss. Right. And what was his boss's response? We fired him. He fired MacArthur. Right. And. But that caused a lot of damage. It caused a lot of unrest in the United States because people loved MacArthur and they couldn't care less about Truman. Right. But Truman actually ended up firing MacArthur, which probably didn't help his political career, but at the same time, it demonstrated that the era of total war was over, the United States could no longer engage in, or really, nobody could engage in total war any longer because of the existence of nuclear weapons. You guys are with me. And so MacArthur complained about it, and he gave a famous speech at West Point that old soldiers never die, they just fade away. But then he did die. So I guess he was wrong about that, too. All right. So anyway, questions, comments about that? I have a question about the armistice line. Is that where the line was before the war began? Actually, the line is the 38th parallel. Okay. That was the line before the war began, but this is where it ended up, basically, almost where it was to begin with."
