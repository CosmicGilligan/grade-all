","Hello. I'm Professor Cox and I will be guiding you through this us history online distance class. In this segment, I'll introduce the course covering topics such as who I am, how to use canvas, the syllabus, course logistics, and your initial assignments. Additionally, we'll watch a video session I held in another class that addresses why we study history. Although we can't have a live discussion, I encourage you to watch this pre recorded segment where I discuss this topic with other students. Let me tell you a little bit about who I am. I graduated high school in 1973, joined the Navy during the Vietnam War, and served for ten years. After I left the Navy, I earned a computer science degree and worked at Hewlett Packard. My passion for history led me back to academia, culminating in a BA in history, graduating magna cum laude, full scholarship for graduate study at the University of California, and a PhD in latin american history. My specialty is modern Mexico, specifically the us occupation of Mexico from 1846 to 1848. Though my primary field is latin american history, I teach us and world history as well. I've been teaching at Mesa College since 2004 and started online teaching in 2020. You obviously know how to get on canvas, otherwise you wouldn't be watching this video. When you get to the home page, you will see that the course is structured into six modules with the first two visible. Initially, modules unlock sequentially as you complete assignments. The lectures I have used in previous online classes were pre recorded during the COVID shutdown when we were meeting on Zoom. I have started updating these lectures, leaving out verbal clumsiness and providing a more scholarly presentation. You will not hear my voice on these lectures because I haven't been able to clone my voice in a reasonable fashion. I want you to know that I wrote all of these lectures and have not used materials from any other source unless specified. This is all my original work and I look forward to seeing your original work in this course. The course materials you will find on canvas include a syllabus, study guides, and additional resources from the textbook publisher. Our textbook is available online for free via Openstax us history should you prefer a print copy, purchasing options are provided. Information about how to purchase can be found on canvas. Each module contains a series of video lectures accompanied by questions. These are designed to test your understanding of the material presented in the videos. I will review your answers and either mark them complete or incomplete. If I mark all answers in a segment correct, I will mark the assignment complete if you complete all assignments in the first three modules, which means watching each video lecture accurately, answering all of the questions and having your answers marked as complete, you will be eligible for exemption from the midterm exam. If I mark your answers incomplete, I will give you feedback about what is missing and you can resubmit the assignment. I wont answer the question for you. You can do this as many times as necessary before the cutoff date for the midterm. My thinking is that if you can demonstrate a thorough understanding of the course material through these assignments, you have already answered all of the questions on the midterm. It's a way to reward consistent engagement and comprehension over the course of the semester. However, it's important to note that this exemption is contingent on the quality of your responses. You must provide answers that align with the information and viewpoints presented in the video lectures. I will review each submission to ensure it meets the required standard. In cases where your response needs revision, youll have the opportunity to make corrections and resubmit I need to add another comment about these assignments. Your simple task is to watch the video lecture and answer the question based on what you learned from the video. It is not to demonstrate how well you can look up stuff on the Internet. If you try and answer the questions without watching the videos by using other Internet sources or chat bots, that is plagiarism and I will know. In that case, I will not grade any more of your assignments and you will lose any chance at exemption from the exam. Do not even try it. I will not give any warning and there will be no appeal. Our grading scale translates 1000 points into a standard 100 point system with opportunities for extra credit. The syllabus lists historical works you will need to acquire on your own, either from the bookstore or elsewhere. Any edition of these works is acceptable and you may be able to find online editions of some of them. I have tried to keep the expense to you. At a minimum, you cannot reach me by telephone. The phone number in the syllabus is there because it is required to be there, but it is a voicemail box I have never set up and never checked in 20 years. I will respond to email on canvas. I encourage you not to use my district email because I get hundreds of emails a week, most of which I have no interest in. It is easy for me to not notice and perhaps inadvertently delete emails. Email via canvas will result in a quicker response. I have set hours for consultations on Zoom and if you are unable to meet during those times, you can make arrangements with me through email. There is also a discussion topic titled Open Forum discussion. I encourage you to check this discussion board from time to time. I will use it to communicate with you and to respond to your questions. You may also use it as a form to answer each other's questions. Communication goes both ways. In a distance course, I need to be able to reach out to you. The only way I have to do that is through email and canvas. I will post announcements on Monday mornings to set the framework for the coming week. Make sure you keep up with them. Also, make sure that your email address on canvas and with the registrar is one that you check on a regular basis. I will sometimes post things that are time sensitive and if you're not paying attention you might miss them. I will not be sympathetic if you do not read the announcements and your email. This class is full with a waiting list. I don't want anyone to drop, but if you feel this class is not going to work for you, you can make room for someone else and I won't feel bad. Also, anyone who is not logged into canvas by Friday at noon will be dropped. Let me repeat that anyone who has not logged into canvas by Friday at noon will be dropped. We will have a number of online discussions. These are graded activities with specified start and end dates. Unlike other assignments, discussions cannot be submitted late. Even though the discussions are asynchronous, we don't all meet at the same time. It is only available for a limited time and its intent is to foster interaction with your colleagues. If I scheduled a meeting for a certain date and time and you fail to attend, then after the meeting had ended, you asked to speak to the empty room where the meeting was. How do you think I should respond? I will not accept late work for discussions. You will notice in the syllabus I have assigned dates to the modules corresponding to weeks in the semester. The only hard dates you need to pay attention to are the weeks before the midterm and final exams. There will be a cutoff after which no new submissions will be accepted. This will allow me to grade all of your submissions before the exam. As I already discussed, once discussions are closed, no more submissions will be accepted. Exams will be timed and they will be available online for one week. You will notice on canvas there is a discussion due this week. You must submit your original posts and responses by next Monday at midnight. Also notice near the top of the canvas homepage there is a link to a document titled Exam one study Guide. This document contains all of the questions that might appear on the midterm exam. I encourage you to keep this guide with you as you go through the lectures and note the answers when you find them. This will help you to prepare for the midterm should you be required to take it. I have structured this course in such a way that I hope will give everyone a chance to succeed. Some of you may not think studying history is either important or interesting. Are only taking this course to satisfy a requirement you might consider there is a reason why it is a requirement. In the next segment you will get a feel for why I think studying history is both important and interesting. I am available to help you in any way I can. Welcome to the class and I look forward to a successful semester together.",000

","I'm done with everything having to do with the mechanics of the class. All right. If you don't know, if you're kind of unsure about what to do next, you should ask me, right. If all in the syllabus. And I will try to keep you apprised of what's going on next. But I don't want to spend the whole day going through the syllabus because my experience is that it's a waste of time because you'll forget it anyway. So I would just plow into our study of history. And the question is why? Why do we study history? How many of you are planning on being historians? That's what I thought. Nobody is going to be a historian. How many of you guys are taking this class just because you love history? And be honest now, okay, a couple of you, maybe three, right? How many of you are. There's actually more. There's five or so, right? How many of you guys are taking this class because you have to. You can't graduate without it. Okay? So come on, be honest. Right? All right. So that's the thing about. About history, is that, generally speaking, Americans are not very interested in our history. I mean, some people think it's really interesting, and we like to study battles and great people and speeches and stuff like that. But for the most part, Americans don't think. We don't identify with our history. Instead, we identify as people that are moving into the future. The whole thing about the american kind of way of looking at the world has been that we're leading the world into the future. So if we're leading the world into the future, why bother looking at the past? And that's really kind of an american characteristic. Americans really don't know their history very well. Like, for example, if you went to Mexico or any latin american country or most european countries, other places in the world, everybody knows very soon their history is part of them. But in the United States, it's just, you know, it's that thing that is on the History Channel and it might be interesting, but what's it got to do with me? Right? But there's a good reason why we study history. And the way that I want to start off by trying to impress that upon you is to ask you to imagine that you wake up in a hospital and you're like, your age, whatever your age is 20 years old, something like that, right? And you wake up in a hospital and you don't remember anything. You don't remember who you are, you don't remember what you have. You don't remember what you know, you don't remember what your skills are. You don't remember who's your relation? You don't remember any of your relationships. How would you be able to move ahead in life at that point? Somebody answered, you don't remember anything. So how can you move ahead in life? What are you going to do next? Nobody wants to answer that. Just ask somebody. You can ask somebody. That's a great thing. And you're right. That's the only way we would ever be able to figure it out. Right? We would ask somebody. But think about this now. Let's say that you're the one that doesn't have any memory and I want to take advantage of that. So you ask me, hey, Professor Cox, or whoever you are, tell me about myself. I don't remember anything. And I'll say, well, you know I actually loaned you a half million dollars, right? You remember that? And you agreed that you were going to wash my car. Right. And you get what I'm saying, right. I could use your ignorance of history to manipulate you into doing things that are not in your interest. Indoctrination. Well, it's like indoctrination, but it's more than that because, yeah, you could say it's indoctrination in terms of using history as a kind of an identity building tool. Right? So now, most of you guys studied history in elementary school and in junior high school or middle school and in high school, right? But what I'm going to tell you now, and you won't like probably, is that all of that history that you learned really wasn't history. Generally speaking, I can't say that for everybody. Right. But what it really was is a repetition of our national myth. And why do we repeat our national myth and why do we get our kids to learn our national myth? Well, the reason why is because we want them to become good Americans, right? We want them to be raised with pride in America. We want them to remember how or to realize how great we are as Americans. Right? And so really what we end up learning is a kind of a gloss over treatment of what happened in the past. Okay. And one of the reasons why people in general are critical of college level professors and historians is because when we look at history, we have to look at it in terms of what actually happened rather than in terms of what message am I trying to bring, right? So it's not possible that I as a historian or any other historian could ever say history in an unbiased way unless I sat here and just recited dates, right. But at the same time, as a historian, it's our responsibility to try to understand what really happened, keeping in mind that there are many different accounts and many different points of view. Right? So the job of the historian isn't just to remember names and dates. The job of the historian is to try to understand what happened in the past so that it can. So that we can understand how it affects our presence. Okay, now, you guys are all with me on this. Let's do this next thing. What I want you to do, and I want you to think about this. We do a little thought exercise, and I want somebody to tell me, what does a patriot look like? And let's just talk about this in terms of american history, what we know about american history and american colonial times and the revolution, that sort of thing. Right. Not football players. Right. But what does a patriot look like? Someone is loyal to their government, to their home country, their people. Okay. Down their life. You're good on all that values. That's all true. I don't know about the loyalty part, though, necessarily, because sometimes a patriot is somebody who stands up against the powers that be. That might be your own country. You could be. You're right, Aaron. Fighting their own country, wasn't it? Because, like, during colonial times, when they were still technically considered part of Britain. Well, yeah. Okay. It depends on what you think of as your country. But when, Aaron, when you say you stand up to the powers that be, it's probably true, most often true, that when you're standing up to the powers that be, it's because the powers that be have betrayed the nation. Right. And that's exactly what happened in the american revolution. So now what I want you to think about, though, is if you were going to draw a picture of a patriot, what would that picture look like? What would it be, a man or a woman? I don't think you could draw a picture. You don't think you could draw a picture, I think would be someone holding their flag, their nation's flag, I guess. Okay, and keep in mind, I'm talking about now at the time of the Boston tea party, right? So I didn't. I didn't tell you that, but I want you to think about at the time of the Boston Tea party, if you were to draw a picture of a patriot, what would that patriot look like? Be a white man. A white man. How is he dressed? Is he dressed in all rich, fancy clothes? Like more worn down, probably? Yeah, more like. Maybe like working class person. Right. Like a like a. Maybe a smith or a farming or farmer or something like that. Okay. And he wears a hat, right? What kind of hat did he wear? Three point. Yeah, the tricorn hat. Right? And. And then he probably has a musket. Right? So let's take a look here and look at this. How about that? Does that look like a patriot? I'm sorry? Looks like what? Us all in the elementary books. Like the little workbooks they give us. Exactly. So this is what we think of as a patriot. Okay. Was it Paul Revere? I'm sorry. No, I don't know who that is. It's just a picture, right? It's a stereotype, actually, what it is. All right, and so now let's think about. And I'm going back to talk about the Boston Tea party, right? Should anybody know about the Boston Tea party? You guys all know about the Boston Tea Party, right? Tell me about the Boston Tea Party. Just in short, three colonists throwing british tea into, like, the water against the tea tax. So they were against the tea tax, and they threw the tea in the harbor. Right? Now, when we think about the people who did that were natives. Yeah. They were dressed as Native Americans, which is interesting, right? But why did they. When we think about who did that, right? What do we think about them? Were they patriots? I guess to us they are. I mean, if another view could. What we have been brought up to believe that they are patriots, right? Am I right about that? We've been. That's the way we've been educated. They're patriots. All right. Now, you may or may not know this. Probably some of you do and some of you don't, right? But the people that we consider to be the tea party patriots were actually. They were. They were a group known as the Sons of Liberty. And the Sons of Liberty was a lot like, I think we could think about, if we were thinking about it in terms of current events, they were a lot like antifa or the Proud Boys. You get what I'm saying? They were kind of extra legal. They weren't working within the system. They were actually against the government. They were trying to bring it down, right? Okay. And so the rest of us in the middle, the great Americans, the good Americans, right. Are actually. The good american colonists at that time. Were. The good american colonists at that time are looking at these people, the sons of blueberry, as dangerous thugs. Right? You guys got that? They were dangerous. Okay, when they threw all that tea in the harbor, we think of that as a great event, right? That they threw all that tea in the harbor. And that really showed that King George. Right. But in reality, people like George Washington said, that's crazy. You don't want to throw the tea in the harbor because it's private property and they were all about private property. They weren't about liberty or any of that stuff. Right. We'll talk more about that as we go on. Right. But the main thing to say here is that we think of them as patriots, but the people who lived at the time, most of them didn't think of them as patriots. Right. So why is it that they are patriots now when they weren't, then it takes time to look back and reflect upon the events. Once you've analyzed them and kind of go, okay, they were, they were or weren't moving things towards a better society. Okay. Anybody else want to add to that revised history? I'm sorry? Like a revised history or like a cleaned up? Okay. So, so we, how many of you guys know about the, how many of you guys have ever heard of the Sons of Liberty before? I have no idea. Do you know that they did things like tar and feather people and they did things like burn, they burned the governor and effigy. They've actually burned down the governor's house and stole its issues and they sink ships and they threw rocks at soldiers and things like that. Does that sound like somebody that's a patriot? Does that sound like somebody that you would want to emulate? Not really. Right. So that part gets left out. You don't learn any of that in, I don't know when you guys study us history in school anymore, but, you know, in elementary school or middle school, you don't learn any of that, right. Or very little of it, if any. Right? Okay. So why, why not, why don't we learn that stuff to indoctrinate perhaps? Okay. Because we want people to be american. I do. Exactly. We want to raise people to be good Americans. Right. And up to till now, the thought has always been that if you want people to be good Americans and you don't want to tell them about the bad stuff, you know what I mean? But history is really a long, tragic story. It's not a story of triumph to triumph, right. In fact, there are triumphs there. There are great things that happen, but there are also things that are not so great that happen as well. Right. And we want to know those things. I'm saying this now. We want to know those things so that we can avoid them in the future. Right. Or in the present. Okay. We want to know what happened in the past, so we can avoid those things in the present. Right. So we don't want to, we don't want to sugarcoat things and say things were always okay. Now think about this, and, you know, there's actually a, there's a little assignment I've given you guys. But think about this. How many of you guys have heard of a modern political movement called the Tea Party? Have you heard of them? Tell me about the tea party. Tell me about the tea party. What is your political orientation? Are they conservative, conservative republican? Conservative Republicans. Right. Okay. And why do you think they call themselves the key part? They wanted to kind of adopt the same type of patriot view. Exactly. They want to associate themselves with the tea party patriots. Right. How many of them do you think realize the true history of the Boston Tea Party and the sons of Liberty? You follow what I'm saying here? So the point I'm trying to make here is that because our history has been so distorted over time, people can infer things about history that are really just not true. Right. You follow what I'm saying here? And why can they do that? The reason why they can do that is because we don't know our history. If we know our history, we say, well, that's not really true. What you guys are saying is not true, but we don't know it. And because we don't know it, then anybody can tell us anything and say, oh, yeah, well, I guess that's right. You follow what I'm saying? Do you think anybody would want to fool you that way with history? Yes, absolutely. I mean, that's basically what american politics is, is to try to fool you about what was. What was what it was like in the past, right? So that you can, like, for example, I mean, many people today, we're going to go back to the good old days. You know, the good old days in the 1950s when, you know, black people were segregated and women couldn't, couldn't work and things like that, because those were the good old days, right? That was when America was great. Okay, you guys got that right? What I want us to do is to. I want you to take a minute and read what's on this page. You guys got it? So what does Abraham Lincoln mean? He says, we cannot escape history. Let me give you. Just happens. Let me give you some background. This is a letter that was written to Congress in 1862, and it was stating the case for ending slavery. And that was a shocking idea. In the United States in 1862, the idea of ending slavery was something that was incredibly radical. And Lincoln had his reasons for doing it, but he believed that slavery was the major issue that was tearing the country apart. And so he thought that to save the nation, he needed to free the slaves. But in order to do that, he had to have Congress on board with him. So he wrote a letter to Congress, and this is what he wrote in that letter. Okay, so now, having said that, what do you think he means when he says, we cannot escape history? I think what he means to say is kind of just the overall concept of history always repeats itself. Okay, I'm glad you said that. Although I disagree. I don't think history repeats itself, but I do think it rhymes. And let me tell you what I mean by that. What I mean by that is the exact same thing doesn't happen over and over again. But what we notice is that people make the same kinds of mistakes over and over again. Right? Why do you think that people make the same kinds of mistakes over and over again? Ignorance to history. Ignorance to history. We don't know what our history is. I think that, generally speaking, say that our history, our historical memory is about two generations, right? Which means that anything that happened earlier than my generation for you guys, is forgotten. And that means that we don't know how to face challenges like the rise of totalitarianism and things like that, because we never had to do it, and nobody that we know ever had to do it. You know what I'm saying? And so then when we see what's happening in the world and we act the same way that our grandparents acted, right, and we get the same results, you know, then we said, well, history repeated itself. But it's not that history repeated itself. It's that we didn't know what our history was to begin with, and so we made the same mistakes we made before. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? I want you to know every student that I've ever had has believed when they started my class that history repeats itself. But history does not repeat itself. What happens is that people make the same stupid mistakes over and over again because they don't know their history. Our history. All right? So that's one thing. So anyway, when we say we cannot escape history, well, yeah, we could say something similar might happen again in the future. But that's not really what he's talking about here. What do you think he's talking about? I think he's talking about that you can either, whether you stand by, do nothing, whether you act or whether you act against it, goes down as the history. So it just happens. History just happens. You know, it's the passing of time and what happened before. So whatever you do is going to go down in history. There's no getting away from it, sidestepping it, and hoping it all works out. That's excellent, Aaron. I think that I'm going to give you a star. You like that? So you guys think all stars, they're lame, but wait till you get one. You like it, right? But the thing is. That's exactly. That's right on it, right? So Lincoln is saying here, people in the future are going to look at us and they're going to say, what did they do? They were in this crisis. How did they act? Right? And he said, you can't escape that. So what are we going to do? Are we going to do something that will make people in the future proud and happy that we did what we did, or are we going to do something that will make people in the future ashamed of what we did? Because no matter what we do, we're making history. Right? So does that make sense to you guys? So if that's true, then where does history happen in time? Where does history happen? When we think about history, we think about the past, right? Dead white men, things like that, you know, the Holocaust, Pearl harbor. Right? But history is happening when every day it's happening right now. We're making history right now. All of us sitting here on our little zooms are making history right now. Probably nobody's going to remember it. Hopefully you guys will. At least I'm still a test, right? But you get what I'm saying, though, right? History is happening right now. So history is not about the past. It's about right now. But there's something else, too, right? And just think about, what does he think this means? The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. What does that tell us? What's he saying there? Think about now when we. He's talking about slavery and the abolition of slavery. Right. What would be the dogmas of the quiet past, you're saying? Like, the way things were. Right. Just because it was that way things were doesn't mean. Exactly. It's going to help us deal with the current issues of the day. Exactly. So now let's say Abraham Lincoln is saying we need to deal with the situation we've got today. What does history tell us? What we've been doing, what didn't work. What we've been doing didn't work. So the history is also about the past. We learn from what happened before so that we can shape the future. Right? I don't know if you guys are familiar. Some of you guys probably have read 1984. Have you read that before? And Orwell says in there, which is actually true, whoever controls the past controls the present. Whoever controls the present controls the future. You guys get what I'm saying? That's actually true. I mean, even though the party said that in the book, right, I. That's actually true. Right. That's how powerful historical memory is, or lack of it. Because if we don't remember, then we're likely to do something stupid, which is. I mean, if you look at american politics and society today, and you look at the level of historical knowledge of people today, you can see a direct correlation. People don't know our history, and so they do stupid things. Right? How does history help us as citizens? It helps reflect on how we are. Right? But why would we need to know history as a citizen? Well, you can spot things. You can spot things that were so, like, a big one today would be censorship. And maybe it's small and it's aligned with something you believe in right now, but that censorship, you know, that's the beginnings of a totalitarian government. Okay. All right, so that's good, right? But now, how would we. What would. If we have this historical knowledge, how would that make a difference? You can pivot. Us as citizens. You can pivot. Instead of going down the same path, how do we express our will as citizens? Voting and protesting. Voting and protesting. Voting, for sure. Right. And that means then that if we don't know our history, how do we know what to vote for? How can we make wise decisions? You follow? Stand. So this is why it's so important for you who are going to be taking over the world pretty quickly from people like me, right, to know what's going on, where we came from, so that you can make wise decisions about the present and the future. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments? So that's why we study history. It's not just so that funny duddies like me have something to do on Tuesday afternoon. Right? Okay, so the last thing I want to talk about here, this we've kind of talked about a little bit. Americans look to the future with hope. Mexicans look to the past with regret. Okay, so this is actually a quote from a mexican author, Octavio Paz, who was writing. He was actually a mexican author, but he was raised in Washington, DC, and so he considered himself to be kind of a bridge between spanish american culture and american culture. And, and one of, he wrote a book, and the name of the book was El Labrento de la Soleda, labyrinth of solitude. And it was a, it won the Nobel Prize, okay, way back, like 1950s or something like that. But at any rate, the book has a comparison of Americans and Mexicans, american culture and mexican culture. And one of the things that he observes is that Mexicans are steeped in the past. If you know anything about mexican history, which we all know some about in this class, right? If you know anything about american history, mexican history, you know that it's tragic, right? That Mexico was conquered over and over and over again, starting with the Spanish and then moving on to the French and the Americans and Spanish again, right? And so Mexicans have this kind of tragic sense of their own history, and it shapes the way that they look at the world. Okay? Americans, as I've already demonstrated, really don't care too much about history. It's like, it's interesting. It's good as a tool to make citizens, but we're going into the future, so forget about history. We don't care about that. Right? Okay. So now, on the one hand, people are kind of, are kind of held down by history, and on the other hand, people are completely ignorant of history. Right? Which do you think is better? Being bogged down to history. You think being bogged down? That's actually a trick. I appreciate your answer, James, but that's actually a trick. Trick question. Because neither one of them really is better, is it? What's really better? What's really better is if we know we can see with clear eyes what happened in the past so that we can move back in. I've said this before, so I don't want to beat myself up. What do they call it? Dead wars. Right. Okay. All right. Last thing, I'm going to skip the one in the middle because I forgot. Okay. Do you guys watch the inauguration of Biden? Anybody? Anybody watch that? You remember the poet Amanda Gorman? She was a young black woman who did this poem. It was a great poem. But this is one of the things that she said. And I thought this is really appropriate for us as students of history. While we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. You know, think about again, we're talking, I'm talking about us history here, and we're going to be in world history starting on Thursday. Right. But I'm talking about just history in general at this point. And one of the things that we look at, if we look at the documents about the american revolution about the government that you were creating. The people were writing at the time that we have the responsibility for millions yet unborn. You see, they really. I think in that case, they really appreciated their responsibility to history. Do we? I'll let you guys answer that yourself. Okay? But now I'm finished.",001
3,"US2: 001 -US2: 001
","I'm done with everything having to do with the mechanics of the class. All right. If you don't know, if you're kind of unsure about what to do next, you should ask me, right. If all in the syllabus. And I will try to keep you apprised of what's going on next. But I don't want to spend the whole day going through the syllabus because my experience is that it's a waste of time because you'll forget it anyway. So I would just plow into our study of history. And the question is why? Why do we study history? How many of you are planning on being historians? That's what I thought. Nobody is going to be a historian. How many of you guys are taking this class just because you love history? And be honest now, okay, a couple of you, maybe three, right? How many of you are. There's actually more. There's five or so, right? How many of you guys are taking this class because you have to. You can't graduate without it. Okay? So come on, be honest. Right? All right. So that's the thing about. About history, is that, generally speaking, Americans are not very interested in our history. I mean, some people think it's really interesting, and we like to study battles and great people and speeches and stuff like that. But for the most part, Americans don't think. We don't identify with our history. Instead, we identify as people that are moving into the future. The whole thing about the american kind of way of looking at the world has been that we're leading the world into the future. So if we're leading the world into the future, why bother looking at the past? And that's really kind of an american characteristic. Americans really don't know their history very well. Like, for example, if you went to Mexico or any latin american country or most european countries, other places in the world, everybody knows very soon their history is part of them. But in the United States, it's just, you know, it's that thing that is on the History Channel and it might be interesting, but what's it got to do with me? Right? But there's a good reason why we study history. And the way that I want to start off by trying to impress that upon you is to ask you to imagine that you wake up in a hospital and you're like, your age, whatever your age is 20 years old, something like that, right? And you wake up in a hospital and you don't remember anything. You don't remember who you are, you don't remember what you have. You don't remember what you know, you don't remember what your skills are. You don't remember who's your relation? You don't remember any of your relationships. How would you be able to move ahead in life at that point? Somebody answered, you don't remember anything. So how can you move ahead in life? What are you going to do next? Nobody wants to answer that. Just ask somebody. You can ask somebody. That's a great thing. And you're right. That's the only way we would ever be able to figure it out. Right? We would ask somebody. But think about this now. Let's say that you're the one that doesn't have any memory and I want to take advantage of that. So you ask me, hey, Professor Cox, or whoever you are, tell me about myself. I don't remember anything. And I'll say, well, you know I actually loaned you a half million dollars, right? You remember that? And you agreed that you were going to wash my car. Right. And you get what I'm saying, right. I could use your ignorance of history to manipulate you into doing things that are not in your interest. Indoctrination. Well, it's like indoctrination, but it's more than that because, yeah, you could say it's indoctrination in terms of using history as a kind of an identity building tool. Right? So now, most of you guys studied history in elementary school and in junior high school or middle school and in high school, right? But what I'm going to tell you now, and you won't like probably, is that all of that history that you learned really wasn't history. Generally speaking, I can't say that for everybody. Right. But what it really was is a repetition of our national myth. And why do we repeat our national myth and why do we get our kids to learn our national myth? Well, the reason why is because we want them to become good Americans, right? We want them to be raised with pride in America. We want them to remember how or to realize how great we are as Americans. Right? And so really what we end up learning is a kind of a gloss over treatment of what happened in the past. Okay. And one of the reasons why people in general are critical of college level professors and historians is because when we look at history, we have to look at it in terms of what actually happened rather than in terms of what message am I trying to bring, right? So it's not possible that I as a historian or any other historian could ever say history in an unbiased way unless I sat here and just recited dates, right. But at the same time, as a historian, it's our responsibility to try to understand what really happened, keeping in mind that there are many different accounts and many different points of view. Right? So the job of the historian isn't just to remember names and dates. The job of the historian is to try to understand what happened in the past so that it can. So that we can understand how it affects our presence. Okay, now, you guys are all with me on this. Let's do this next thing. What I want you to do, and I want you to think about this. We do a little thought exercise, and I want somebody to tell me, what does a patriot look like? And let's just talk about this in terms of american history, what we know about american history and american colonial times and the revolution, that sort of thing. Right. Not football players. Right. But what does a patriot look like? Someone is loyal to their government, to their home country, their people. Okay. Down their life. You're good on all that values. That's all true. I don't know about the loyalty part, though, necessarily, because sometimes a patriot is somebody who stands up against the powers that be. That might be your own country. You could be. You're right, Aaron. Fighting their own country, wasn't it? Because, like, during colonial times, when they were still technically considered part of Britain. Well, yeah. Okay. It depends on what you think of as your country. But when, Aaron, when you say you stand up to the powers that be, it's probably true, most often true, that when you're standing up to the powers that be, it's because the powers that be have betrayed the nation. Right. And that's exactly what happened in the american revolution. So now what I want you to think about, though, is if you were going to draw a picture of a patriot, what would that picture look like? What would it be, a man or a woman? I don't think you could draw a picture. You don't think you could draw a picture, I think would be someone holding their flag, their nation's flag, I guess. Okay, and keep in mind, I'm talking about now at the time of the Boston tea party, right? So I didn't. I didn't tell you that, but I want you to think about at the time of the Boston Tea party, if you were to draw a picture of a patriot, what would that patriot look like? Be a white man. A white man. How is he dressed? Is he dressed in all rich, fancy clothes? Like more worn down, probably? Yeah, more like. Maybe like working class person. Right. Like a like a. Maybe a smith or a farming or farmer or something like that. Okay. And he wears a hat, right? What kind of hat did he wear? Three point. Yeah, the tricorn hat. Right? And. And then he probably has a musket. Right? So let's take a look here and look at this. How about that? Does that look like a patriot? I'm sorry? Looks like what? Us all in the elementary books. Like the little workbooks they give us. Exactly. So this is what we think of as a patriot. Okay. Was it Paul Revere? I'm sorry. No, I don't know who that is. It's just a picture, right? It's a stereotype, actually, what it is. All right, and so now let's think about. And I'm going back to talk about the Boston Tea party, right? Should anybody know about the Boston Tea party? You guys all know about the Boston Tea Party, right? Tell me about the Boston Tea Party. Just in short, three colonists throwing british tea into, like, the water against the tea tax. So they were against the tea tax, and they threw the tea in the harbor. Right? Now, when we think about the people who did that were natives. Yeah. They were dressed as Native Americans, which is interesting, right? But why did they. When we think about who did that, right? What do we think about them? Were they patriots? I guess to us they are. I mean, if another view could. What we have been brought up to believe that they are patriots, right? Am I right about that? We've been. That's the way we've been educated. They're patriots. All right. Now, you may or may not know this. Probably some of you do and some of you don't, right? But the people that we consider to be the tea party patriots were actually. They were. They were a group known as the Sons of Liberty. And the Sons of Liberty was a lot like, I think we could think about, if we were thinking about it in terms of current events, they were a lot like antifa or the Proud Boys. You get what I'm saying? They were kind of extra legal. They weren't working within the system. They were actually against the government. They were trying to bring it down, right? Okay. And so the rest of us in the middle, the great Americans, the good Americans, right. Are actually. The good american colonists at that time. Were. The good american colonists at that time are looking at these people, the sons of blueberry, as dangerous thugs. Right? You guys got that? They were dangerous. Okay, when they threw all that tea in the harbor, we think of that as a great event, right? That they threw all that tea in the harbor. And that really showed that King George. Right. But in reality, people like George Washington said, that's crazy. You don't want to throw the tea in the harbor because it's private property and they were all about private property. They weren't about liberty or any of that stuff. Right. We'll talk more about that as we go on. Right. But the main thing to say here is that we think of them as patriots, but the people who lived at the time, most of them didn't think of them as patriots. Right. So why is it that they are patriots now when they weren't, then it takes time to look back and reflect upon the events. Once you've analyzed them and kind of go, okay, they were, they were or weren't moving things towards a better society. Okay. Anybody else want to add to that revised history? I'm sorry? Like a revised history or like a cleaned up? Okay. So, so we, how many of you guys know about the, how many of you guys have ever heard of the Sons of Liberty before? I have no idea. Do you know that they did things like tar and feather people and they did things like burn, they burned the governor and effigy. They've actually burned down the governor's house and stole its issues and they sink ships and they threw rocks at soldiers and things like that. Does that sound like somebody that's a patriot? Does that sound like somebody that you would want to emulate? Not really. Right. So that part gets left out. You don't learn any of that in, I don't know when you guys study us history in school anymore, but, you know, in elementary school or middle school, you don't learn any of that, right. Or very little of it, if any. Right? Okay. So why, why not, why don't we learn that stuff to indoctrinate perhaps? Okay. Because we want people to be american. I do. Exactly. We want to raise people to be good Americans. Right. And up to till now, the thought has always been that if you want people to be good Americans and you don't want to tell them about the bad stuff, you know what I mean? But history is really a long, tragic story. It's not a story of triumph to triumph, right. In fact, there are triumphs there. There are great things that happen, but there are also things that are not so great that happen as well. Right. And we want to know those things. I'm saying this now. We want to know those things so that we can avoid them in the future. Right. Or in the present. Okay. We want to know what happened in the past, so we can avoid those things in the present. Right. So we don't want to, we don't want to sugarcoat things and say things were always okay. Now think about this, and, you know, there's actually a, there's a little assignment I've given you guys. But think about this. How many of you guys have heard of a modern political movement called the Tea Party? Have you heard of them? Tell me about the tea party. Tell me about the tea party. What is your political orientation? Are they conservative, conservative republican? Conservative Republicans. Right. Okay. And why do you think they call themselves the key part? They wanted to kind of adopt the same type of patriot view. Exactly. They want to associate themselves with the tea party patriots. Right. How many of them do you think realize the true history of the Boston Tea Party and the sons of Liberty? You follow what I'm saying here? So the point I'm trying to make here is that because our history has been so distorted over time, people can infer things about history that are really just not true. Right. You follow what I'm saying here? And why can they do that? The reason why they can do that is because we don't know our history. If we know our history, we say, well, that's not really true. What you guys are saying is not true, but we don't know it. And because we don't know it, then anybody can tell us anything and say, oh, yeah, well, I guess that's right. You follow what I'm saying? Do you think anybody would want to fool you that way with history? Yes, absolutely. I mean, that's basically what american politics is, is to try to fool you about what was. What was what it was like in the past, right? So that you can, like, for example, I mean, many people today, we're going to go back to the good old days. You know, the good old days in the 1950s when, you know, black people were segregated and women couldn't, couldn't work and things like that, because those were the good old days, right? That was when America was great. Okay, you guys got that right? What I want us to do is to. I want you to take a minute and read what's on this page. You guys got it? So what does Abraham Lincoln mean? He says, we cannot escape history. Let me give you. Just happens. Let me give you some background. This is a letter that was written to Congress in 1862, and it was stating the case for ending slavery. And that was a shocking idea. In the United States in 1862, the idea of ending slavery was something that was incredibly radical. And Lincoln had his reasons for doing it, but he believed that slavery was the major issue that was tearing the country apart. And so he thought that to save the nation, he needed to free the slaves. But in order to do that, he had to have Congress on board with him. So he wrote a letter to Congress, and this is what he wrote in that letter. Okay, so now, having said that, what do you think he means when he says, we cannot escape history? I think what he means to say is kind of just the overall concept of history always repeats itself. Okay, I'm glad you said that. Although I disagree. I don't think history repeats itself, but I do think it rhymes. And let me tell you what I mean by that. What I mean by that is the exact same thing doesn't happen over and over again. But what we notice is that people make the same kinds of mistakes over and over again. Right? Why do you think that people make the same kinds of mistakes over and over again? Ignorance to history. Ignorance to history. We don't know what our history is. I think that, generally speaking, say that our history, our historical memory is about two generations, right? Which means that anything that happened earlier than my generation for you guys, is forgotten. And that means that we don't know how to face challenges like the rise of totalitarianism and things like that, because we never had to do it, and nobody that we know ever had to do it. You know what I'm saying? And so then when we see what's happening in the world and we act the same way that our grandparents acted, right, and we get the same results, you know, then we said, well, history repeated itself. But it's not that history repeated itself. It's that we didn't know what our history was to begin with, and so we made the same mistakes we made before. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? I want you to know every student that I've ever had has believed when they started my class that history repeats itself. But history does not repeat itself. What happens is that people make the same stupid mistakes over and over again because they don't know their history. Our history. All right? So that's one thing. So anyway, when we say we cannot escape history, well, yeah, we could say something similar might happen again in the future. But that's not really what he's talking about here. What do you think he's talking about? I think he's talking about that you can either, whether you stand by, do nothing, whether you act or whether you act against it, goes down as the history. So it just happens. History just happens. You know, it's the passing of time and what happened before. So whatever you do is going to go down in history. There's no getting away from it, sidestepping it, and hoping it all works out. That's excellent, Aaron. I think that I'm going to give you a star. You like that? So you guys think all stars, they're lame, but wait till you get one. You like it, right? But the thing is. That's exactly. That's right on it, right? So Lincoln is saying here, people in the future are going to look at us and they're going to say, what did they do? They were in this crisis. How did they act? Right? And he said, you can't escape that. So what are we going to do? Are we going to do something that will make people in the future proud and happy that we did what we did, or are we going to do something that will make people in the future ashamed of what we did? Because no matter what we do, we're making history. Right? So does that make sense to you guys? So if that's true, then where does history happen in time? Where does history happen? When we think about history, we think about the past, right? Dead white men, things like that, you know, the Holocaust, Pearl harbor. Right? But history is happening when every day it's happening right now. We're making history right now. All of us sitting here on our little zooms are making history right now. Probably nobody's going to remember it. Hopefully you guys will. At least I'm still a test, right? But you get what I'm saying, though, right? History is happening right now. So history is not about the past. It's about right now. But there's something else, too, right? And just think about, what does he think this means? The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. What does that tell us? What's he saying there? Think about now when we. He's talking about slavery and the abolition of slavery. Right. What would be the dogmas of the quiet past, you're saying? Like, the way things were. Right. Just because it was that way things were doesn't mean. Exactly. It's going to help us deal with the current issues of the day. Exactly. So now let's say Abraham Lincoln is saying we need to deal with the situation we've got today. What does history tell us? What we've been doing, what didn't work. What we've been doing didn't work. So the history is also about the past. We learn from what happened before so that we can shape the future. Right? I don't know if you guys are familiar. Some of you guys probably have read 1984. Have you read that before? And Orwell says in there, which is actually true, whoever controls the past controls the present. Whoever controls the present controls the future. You guys get what I'm saying? That's actually true.

And maybe it's small and it's aligned with something you believe in right now, but that censorship, you know, that's the beginnings of a totalitarian government. Okay. All right, so that's good, right? But now, how would we. What would. If we have this historical knowledge, how would that make a difference? You can pivot. Us as citizens. You can pivot. Instead of going down the same path, how do we express our will as citizens? Voting and protesting. Voting and protesting. Voting, for sure. Right. And that means then that if we don't know our history, how do we know what to vote for? How can we make wise decisions? You follow? Stand. So this is why it's so important for you who are going to be taking over the world pretty quickly from people like me, right, to know what's going on, where we came from, so that you can make wise decisions about the present and the future. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments? So that's why we study history. It's not just so that funny duddies like me have something to do on Tuesday afternoon. Right?

Because neither one of them really is better, is it? What's really better? What's really better is if we know we can see with clear eyes what happened in the past so that we can move back in. I've said this before, so I don't want to beat myself up. What do they call it? Dead wars. Right. Okay. All right. Last thing, I'm going to skip the one in the middle because I forgot. Okay. Do you guys watch the inauguration of Biden? Anybody? Anybody watch that? You remember the poet Amanda Gorman? She was a young black woman who did this poem. It was a great poem. But this is one of the things that she said. And I thought this is really appropriate for us as students of history. While we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. You know, think about again, we're talking, I'm talking about us history here, and we're going to be in world history starting on Thursday. Right. But I'm talking about just history in general at this point. And one of the things that we look at, if we look at the documents about the american revolution about the government that you were creating. The people were writing at the time that we have the responsibility for millions yet unborn. You see, they really. I think in that case, they really appreciated their responsibility to history. Do we? I'll let you guys answer that yourself. Okay? But now I'm finished.",001

","We're going to actually just jump right in, and there's going to be a lot of information today. We won't be doing this. You guys see my little slide that says Europe on the eve of expansion on it. You guys see that? Okay, so what we're doing here is you guys might be thinking, well, you know, this is supposed to be us history. We should start with, you know, Plymouth Rock or something like that. But what the United States is arises out of european culture. And it's really what we can see is that we can see that the existence of the United States is a consequence of things that started happening in Europe hundreds of years before the United States was founded. Okay? But it's important for us to look at those things so that when the United States does come into being, we know where it comes from. It's not like it just appeared like magic out of nowhere, right? And so then the question always becomes, well, where do you start? And, you know, since time is more like a river than it is anything else, you have to put your toes in somewhere. You just pick some arbitrary place. So the arbitrary place that I'm going to choose is going to be in basically right here. Okay, so let me just explain to you this little timeline I put together here. First off, notice that it says western history timeline. Okay? So what that means is that this is a timeline of events that occurred in western history. And, you know, in the Americas, the atlantic world, after, say, the 1500, but other parts of the world would have a different timeline. So this is only appropriate for, basically western Europe. And again, the reason why we look at that is because that's where the ideas that the United States is founded on come from. Out of that experience, when we look at western history, we can divide it into three different periods, all right? And the three periods are the classical, the medieval, and the modern. Okay, so now you guys mostly think. You might think that modern means what's going on right now, but in academia, in academic terms, modernism is something that came into being at around 1500, and it ended really in the middle of the 20th century. And we're in what was called, what's called a postmodern period now. But we'll just leave that aside for the moment. Just say that modern means everything pretty much after 1500 or so. Okay, so the classical era is the Greeks and the Romans and the Egyptians and all that stuff. And we can draw a line in where the classical period ended in 476. Okay. 476 AD or ce, depending on how you want to look at it, ad means anno domini. And ce means in the common era. So a lot of scholars use ce rather than Anno Domini to remove the christian implications of it. But whatever. The point here is that the years 476. And why did we pick that year? Well, that was a year that Rome, the city of Rome, was sacked by barbarians, okay? Now, the reality is that the city had been sacked before, and it would be sacked again later. And so 476 just ends up being a kind of an arbitrary marker, okay? And if you were living in Rome in 476, you would not one day wake up and say, oh, my God, the roman empire's fallen, and we're in the medieval period now, because that's just not the way it works. What would happen would be that time would be going on, and it would be only later that you could look back and see, okay, well, everything kind of changed right there, so let's just put a marker right there. Okay? You guys got that? Questions, comments. Now, why do I say that? Well, the reason why is because many of you guys probably think that history is about memorizing names and dates, right? Is that what you guys did in high school? But keep in mind that who taught you history in high school, right? It was the coach, and he didn't know history, and so he just went by the book and had you guys memorize names and dates, and you guys thought that was really useless. And you're right, it was useless. Memorizing names and dates is a. Is a futile activity. You know, you can. Nowadays, particularly, you can look up any date you want on your. On your phone. You don't even have to remember anything, right? But it's important to know when things happened in relationship to each other, right? So it's important to know, if we say that the Roman Empire fell in 476, the reason why we say that is because it's more. It's important to know that happened before, say, the french revolution in 1789. We can put things in order. Okay? But you don't have to remember the exact dates. You can actually find them online if you need them. All right? And I won't ever ask you to tell me dates of anything. All right? Questions, comments.",111

","The first thing we'll do is we're going to look at a timeline. And we started talking. I gave you a timeline last week, and I said that we had divide. We'll divide our period up between the classical, the medieval, and the modern. Right? And so remember, we said that the classical ended in 476 and the medieval ended in 1453. And that brings us into the modern period. And then generally, this, this whole period here is referred to in historical language as the early modern period. All right? So the, we talked on Wednesday, I'm pretty sure, about the reformation and how the reformation broke the church but also broke all of society in Europe, and that the reformation would lead to over a century of religious warfare. Okay? And in fact, some of that religious warfare still kind of is going on. There's always you guys who probably already know that there's a, or have seen that there's a conflict often between religion and science, okay? It's not as bloody as it used to be, but it's still there. There's still that conflict there. At any rate, the point is that the reformation leads to a period of really destructive religious warfare. And we did talk last week about how a religious war, you can't win a religious war because unless you kill everybody from the other religion, because people won't. Aren't willing to change their religion, they're not willing to be forced into another religion. And so the destruction is endless. And in the end, what happens is that there's going to be a group of people who we're going to call philosophs, and these people will reject religion, organized religion, the way that we know it, and. Or the christian religion, I guess we could say. And they will look for another basis for understanding the world than God's revelation. Right. And that's going to be the enlightenment. Enlightenment is essentially a way of a project to try to understand the world without God. Okay? And so when they're looking for another focus of truth, they will find, they will settle on science. Right? And we're going to talk about science, how that kind of develops in just a minute. But the thing that I wanted to point out here about the science is that science is the observation of nature, right? So it's the kind of organized, methodical observation and recording of nature. Right. And so what you do in science is you measure and then you record that measurement, and then you develop a hypothesis based on that measurement. Right. And we'll talk again a little bit more about that. But the main thing is that the measurement comes directly from nature. Right. So that means then that we're looking, rather than looking for truth in religious revelation, the Bible. We're looking for truth and nature. We're getting it directly from nature. And then how do we understand that truth? We understand the truth by our noodles, right? Our minds, okay? And so what we're proposing is that instead of having the foundation of truth in revelation in the Bible, we're having the revelation of truth in our own minds. And that's why they call this the age of reason. You guys get what I'm saying? Because where does reason happen? Reason happens in our minds, right? So what the enlightenment tells us is that the truth is to be found in nature and we understand it by our rational minds, okay? And we don't need any God in there to do to. To tell us anything about it. That's basically. And again, it's kind of an oversimplification, but it is basically the idea of the enlightenment. We're going to talk about cosmology, and I wish I had a board, but I don't. So we're just going to have to, you have to kind of imagine a little bit here in your mind, right? We're going to talk about cosmology, and we're going to talk about the structure. Cosmology means the structure of the universe, right? Cosmos is the world, and ologies the study of. So it's a study of basically everything, right? And what it really kind of refers to in our idea, our terminology, is the structure of the sky, the things that are in the sky, right? And keeping in mind that at the time really going, I mean, let's say, going back to the time of, say, the roman empire, right, that people didn't, they could see things moving in the sky, but they never felt the earth moving. So they figured that the earth was immovable because you don't feel it moving, right. I mean, we know a thing, but you don't feel it moving, right? And so they figured that the earth was immovable and that everything revolved around the earth. And that's kind of what it looks like, right? It looks like the sun's going around the earth and then the moon's going around the earth. You guys get what I'm saying? So everything is, everything is circling the earth. So from their point of view, the structure of the universe was geocentric. Geocentric. Giss actually is greek for earth, right? So that's where they get geo, meaning that the earth is at the center, okay? And in about the year, say, 150 or so, ad or ce, no, however you say it, right, there was a greek philosopher named Ptolemy. And Ptolemy decided to record and mathematically prove the structure of the universe. And his structure was that the earth was at the center, right? Here's the problem with the. I'll show it to you in a minute. But here's the problem with the earth being at the center, right? And that is that if the earth is at the center, then it would follow that everything that goes around the earth will go in a perfect circle at a. At a fixed rate, right? So it will advance a certain amount. Say, if you were, if you were observing, you could see it advance a certain amount in the sky every night, right? And that would continue in your perfect circle. You guys follow me here. But what really, you see, let's say, for example, if you're following the orb, Mars, right? And you see Mars is moving forward, but then after a while, it slows down, right? And then, and then it actually goes backwards, right. And then it'll turn around and go forward again. Right? So that that little maneuver that it did, going, stopping, going backwards, and then, and then going forward again is called retrograde motion, okay? And that was difficult to explain because if everything is at the center, if the earth is at the center of everything, how do you explain that retrograde motion? Right? And that's what Ptolemy did. Ptolemy said, okay, well, here's the deal. Yeah. The Mars is moving around the earth at a. At a rate specific rate, right. And in a specific direction, and it always does that. But it's also on its own orbit. And. And so as the Mars is moving in this constant direction, it's also moving on its own orbit. So sometimes it looks like it's going forward, and sometimes it looks like it's going backwards. You guys get me? And so what Ptolemy did, this is just one example, right? But there were thousands of these things, right? He actually proved that the earth was at the center by creating thousands of these little epicycles, right? And so what we see then is that from the point of view of anybody who thought about the structure of the universe, scholarly, in a scholarly way at the time, would have seen that the earth was at the center and there was mathematical proof of that. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? So nobody would question that because there's mathematical proof. Okay? But now let's think about this for a second. How did Ptolemy come up with his proof? What was his proof? Where did that proof come from? Just kind of think about that for a second. The problem is that the structure of the universe position of things in the sky gives us our calendar. And if the things that are in the sky are not predictable, then we don't know, really know when it is according to our calendar. And the problem with that at the time was that the church was based on the calendar. So everything that happened in the church happened according to the calendar. Right. And the problem with the calendar was that it was imprecise, that there was errors in it, and that the only way you could actually fix these errors was by doing a certain observation at a certain time. And so the result of it was that most of the time, they didn't really know when now is. But that's important. It's important to know when now is, because, for example, I don't. Some of you know that tomorrow is Mardi gras at Tuesday, and then Wednesday is the beginning of lent. Right? Well, how do we know that? We know that because of the calendar. We look at things in the sky, and we can see, okay, well, this is when this is going to happen, right? And that may not be important to most of us here, but it's very important to people who live in the middle ages. Right? Because as I mentioned to you guys last week, the church is the foundation of everything. Okay? So. So now, um, this guy, the. Because there were these problems with the calendar, the Vatican actually, um, assigned a priest from Bohemia, Czechoslovakia, I think, or to to to come up with a way to fix the calendar. And that was a guy named Copernicus. Right? So, Copernicus, he built a model of the way that the universe supposedly works. And then he had this epiphany, right? This, ah, moment, right? And he thought, well, what if instead of the earth being at the center, the sun was at the center? And then he realized that once he worked that whole thing out mathematically, that not only does it, not only does it fix the calendar, but it also solves the issue of retrograde motion, right? Because what. Let me just kind of show you how this works here. It's going to. You have to kind of imagine, all right, but let's say this is the sun and this is the earth, right? And the earth is moving around at a constant speed, right? And here's Mars. And Mars is moving around at a constant speed as well. But it just so happens that when Mars passes the earth, it actually looks like it's slowing down, right? And then it moves. Then it stops and it moves backwards. It moves forward. But it's just because of the relationship in the orbits between the earth and Mars. You guys get what I'm saying. So that solves the problem. You can't, you don't have to imagine a soul with two centers in order to be able to explain how the earth is at the center, because the earth isn't at the center. It's the sun. And that's why they call it the heliocentric view of the universe. Helios is sun. Right. You guys got me questions. All right, so here's, then we'll take a look at Ptolemy or Copernicus's model, right? And here's we see the sun is at the center, and here's Mercury and Venus and Earth and the moon going around the earth and then Jupiter and all these other. Right? But what you see here is the solar system and the orbits of the, of the objects in the solar system in perfect circles, right? And it was imagined. And this seems odd to us, but this is what they imagined, that these objects were actually moving. They were fixed in glass spheres. Right. And it was actually the spheres that were moving. Right. And that's what caused the planets to move. Okay. As we're going to find out later, there aren't any glass spheres. And what really causes the planets to move is gravity. Right. But they didn't know that. Right. So here's what we see. We went from Ptolemy, who was able to prove that the, the earth was at the center of the universe, to Copernicus, who proves that the sun is at the center of the universe. That seems like progress, right? Even though he's still wrong. I mean, there aren't any glass spheres and there, and there aren't any perfect circular orbits and things like that. So he's still wrong, but it seems like it's closer to the truth, right? So we get this idea that science advances by, by little steps. It's an unending search for the truth, right? Okay, you guys are all following me here, right? Questions? Comments? All right, so let's go back. Now, there's another guy. His name is Galileo Galilei, and he's italian mathematician. He works for the Duke of Tuscany. And the duke actually assigned to him a task of figuring out a way to aim cannons better, because they had this new terror weapon called a cannon. But it was very inaccurate. And they tried, they were trying to figure out how can we, how can we better measure the, the angle of the cannon, to be more precise, of what we hit, right. And keep in mind, at this time, they had idea about gravity and things like that, right? So. So he actually did a series of experiments. And the experiments were that he would, he had a ball and he had an inclined plane. And what he would do is he would roll the ball down the incline plane and measure how fast it accelerated. Right? And he did that with hundreds of different angles. So he really took thousands of measurements of this ball moving down an inclined plane at different angles. And from all of that data, he was able to derive what's called Galileo's law. And those of you guys who study science may know that Galileo's law is that objects in motion will accelerate at 32ft/second per second. Which means, I have no idea. I'm not a scientist, I'm a historian. Right. But it doesn't matter what the law is. The main thing is that it is a law. And that means that any object in motion can be predicted to accelerate at 32ft/second per second at a given angle. You guys get what I'm saying? And so that means then we have a precise way of knowing where something will be. And in essence, what that means is that we can see the future. Science allows us to predict the future. You get what I'm saying? All right. Okay. Now let's think about for a minute the difference between how. Well, let's, let's go a little bit further and then we'll go back. Right. So, so now that was, um, the first thing. There was this calculator that Galileo thought up that, that helped them to aim their canons. Because remember, this is the religious wars going on at this time. But later he gets his hands on a new high tech gadget that came from Holland. And the gadget was called a telescope, right? And what the telescope did was it allowed people to be able to see farther than other people. Right? And what the telescope was originally used for was you could go up to, say, the tower of St. Mark's in Venice, which is where Galileo was, and you could point the telescope out to sea and you could see what ships were coming in. And because you would know what ships were coming in, you would be able to know what goods were coming in and you could fix the prices. And so you can make a lot of money that way. Right? And so he made a lot of money selling these telescopes to the merchants in Venice. Right? But then he had this crazy idea. And the idea was he was going to point this telescope at the sky and he points the telescope at the sky and lo and behold, what he's able to observe is that the, that Copernicus's ideas about the sun being at the center of the solar system were true. He could prove it, Matthew. He could prove it by observation. Right? Now, when Copernicus had proposed his model of the solar system, the Vatican had been incredibly happy because that fixed the calendar. But they didn't believe that what he said was true. They said that, oh, it's just a way of thinking about it. It's just a model for thinking about it, but it doesn't really represent reality because we know they think, according to the Bible, that the earth doesn't move, right? So the earth can't possibly be moving because the Bible says it doesn't move, which it doesn't. Right? But. But the Bible says it doesn't move. Right? And so therefore, that means that what Copernicus thought up is a great mathematical model, but it's not reality. Okay, here Galileo is showing is that it's not just a great mathematical model, it's actually real. And the reason why I know it's real is because I saw it. I looked at it, right? Okay, so now let's think about the difference between how Copernicus thought up how Copernicus arrived at his model and how Galileo proved it. What is the difference? How did Copernicus arrive at his model? How did he reach his conclusion? He had an idea, right? He had an epiphany. Nobody had ever thought of that before. Nobody ever thought that. You'd put this at the middle and the earth rotating around the sun, right? Nobody ever thought that before. But he thought it. Right? But the main thing is that he thought it. It was just an idea, and then he proved it mathematically. Right? You see what I'm saying? Well, that's okay if you think about, well, it's got a mathematical proof. But remember, Ptolemy had a mathematical proof as well, right? So mathematical proof doesn't really necessarily make it represent reality. But what's the difference between how Copernicus arrived at his model and how Galileo proved the model? What did Galileo do to prove it? He observed the planets himself. He observed, right? And that's the basis for science. The basis for. That's why we call Galileo the father of the scientific revolution, right? Because the basis for science is to observe and record and then to follow the results of what you've recorded, essentially, right? So that's reason you don't have to think anything up. You just look at it, measure it, and it's there for you. And that's why they think reason is a better way of imagining the universe than religion, because reason is based on what we can actually measure and observe, right? You guys get what I'm saying. Okay, so, so now this is the beginning of what we call the scientific revolution. The problem at this time was that Galileo, he, he made this. He wrote this pamphlet called the Starry messenger. And in this pamphlet, he recorded all the things he'd seen. He recorded the blemishes on the moon, and he recorded shadows on Venus and things like that, and all of those things to the end that he's able to prove that the earth is at the center, excuse me. That the sun is at the center of the solar system. And, and that doesn't really get him in trouble. That's something that, that might have gotten him in trouble. As long as he's just, you know, publishing stories like that, that's fine. You know, they don't like it, but, you know, they'll let that go. Okay, the church I'm talking about. Okay, but one morning, he's having breakfast with his boss's wife, the grand duchess Christina. And the grand Duchess Christina has read the starring messenger, and she asked Galileo if what the starry messenger says true. Did that mean that the Bible was wrong? And that's a loaded question, right? Because the Bible can't be wrong according to the church. Okay, and so what Galileo said, and not only did he say it, but he actually wrote it in a letter to the grand Duchess Christina. You can actually look that up online if you want. He wrote in this letter that the Bible was absolutely true in regard to faith and morals, but that it was not scientifically accurate. And that's what got trouble because. Because the church could not stand anybody to challenge the veracity, the truth of the Bible. And so they forced him to recant. And as far as. And they banned his work and they banned Copernicus work. And as far as they were concerned, the scientific revolution was over. Okay, you guys are living. But it wasn't over. And the reason why was because in northern Europe now, the catholic church no longer has influence. It did. This is the Protestant Reformation. There's areas of Germany and Denmark and Scandinavia and Holland and England, eventually, who are all going to be able to. They were scientists going to be able to continue their research. And eventually, what ends up happening is that kind of what they call the height of the scientific revolution is Isaac Newton in England will publish a volume called Principia Mathematica, which is, which basically is the foundation for the. What we call physics. Right. Newtonian physics. All right? And. And that becomes, as far as anybody in, in the west is concerned, that's the basis for reality. It sets this it sets the foundation of. Of how we understand the physical universe. Okay. What's interesting here is, if you notice the date of the publication of Principia Mathematica, it is almost contemporaneous with the publication of the second treatise on civil government, right? You guys with me? So do you think that's coincidental? No, it's not, because what we see happening is this intellectual movement away from religion as the foundation of truth and toward science as a foundation of. Okay, questions, comments? And really what ends up happening from that is that science is now the. That's how we understand the truth, okay? And science becomes unassailable. All right? Meaning that if you can prove something scientifically, then that's the last word, right? If you have scientific proof of something, that's the last word. Okay. There's a problem with that as well. And the problem with that is that the proof is only as valid as the study that creates the proof, right? So one example, we could say, go back, say, to the 1950s when they started to realize that cigarettes cause cancer, right? There was scientific evidence that showed that cigarettes cause cancer, right? And they started to publish that evidence. And that puts the tobacco companies under stress, because people don't want to smoke cigarettes if there's going to cause cancer, right? And so what happens is they pay a bunch of scientists to cast doubt, right? And they say, well, yeah, this is. This might not be true. I mean, we have a scientist right here that says that. Here's a guy who lived 100 years and he smoked all his life and didn't die of cancer, right? So there's this doubt in there. And once you introduce doubt, then your proof goes out the window. Right? It's the same exact thing that we see happening with climate change, right? Climate change has been absolutely proven to be the activity of human beings on earth. Right? Right. But if you can cast doubt on that, then people can say, well, it's not really true. You know, maybe the science isn't really true. Okay? And so science, even though we use it as the foundation for our truth, if we can't trust the science, there really isn't any foundation for our truth, and we might as well believe in fairy tales. You guys get what I'm saying? And a lot of people do.",111

","As we begin our survey of us history from the post civil war Reconstruction era through to the 20th and possibly the 21st century, it will be helpful to understand the events preceding the civil war. This lecture will consider some of the major issues leading to the civil war and some of the unresolved conflicts resulting from that war. Our first point of discussion is the conceptualization of the United States not as a singular socio cultural entity, but as a nation comprised of many distinct nations. This diversity, deeply rooted in economic variants, traces back to the colonial era. The establishment of Jamestown, the first successful english colony in North America, marked the beginnings of a plantation economy in the south, heavily reliant on slave labor. In stark contrast, the Congregationalists or Calvinists who settled in New England were driven by the pursuit of religious freedom. The land in New England was unsuitable for plantation agriculture. As the population grew, the land could not sustain family farming, and the New Englanders formed a society built around mercantile principles. This dichotomy and economic foundations laid the groundwork for varying societal structures. The south, with its plantation economy, bore resemblance to the feudal systems of medieval Europe, with the critical distinction of being underpinned by slavery rather than serfdom. The north, meanwhile, mirrored the industrialization and modernization unfolding in England, positioning itself closely behind England in the timeline of the industrial revolution. Prior to the civil war, individual's primary identity was tied to their state. One was a Virginian, a Texan, or a Massachusettsian before being an American. This perspective was fundamentally altered post civil war. Before the civil war, it was common to refer to the country as the United States are. After the civil war, the United States is became common, reimagining the country as a single nation rather than a nation of nations. The supremacy of the national government will grow over time and will become fully realized by the Second World War. The constitutional convention revealed deep divisions, particularly regarding the supremacy of state versus federal power. The Constitution, upon its ratification, established a federal system delineating two levels of governance, each with distinct jurisdictions. Today, if we were to draw a diagram of the relationship of the national government to the states, we would put the national government at the top with arrows pointing down to the states. At the time the Constitution was written, many people, especially southerners, would have not put arrows on the line separating the national government from the states, and some, notably Thomas Jefferson, would have drawn the arrows going the other way. The argument was that since it was the states that created the federal system, the states could also dissolve it. This federal structure was pivotal in shaping the evolving national identity. America's first party system arose during the presidency of President George Washington, the system was driven by an ideological rift between Alexander Hamilton, the secretary of the treasury, and Thomas Jefferson, the secretary of state. Hamilton's followers, known as federalists, advocated for a strong central government and a loose interpretation of the Constitution, aligning with commerce and industry and favoring Britain as a key ally. Conversely, Jefferson's advocates, the democratic Republicans, supported state sovereignty, strict adherence to the Constitution, and an agrarian economic outlook. Slavery was integral to the southern economy and became a central issue in american politics at the time of America's founding. Few questioned the morality of slavery. It was a fact of life. Slave labor created immense wealth not only for the United States but also for western Europe. The value of owned slaves was a major component of the wealth of the United States. The Constitution itself reflective of the times, embedded slavery within its framework, notably in the three fifths clause, where southern states were able to count every five slaves as three people for the purpose of representation. But also represented in the Constitution was the emerging anti slavery movement. The document called for the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. After 20 years in foreign policy, the United States during the early republic adopted significant doctrines. Americans expansionist instincts at the time were focused on the vast north american continent. Even so, the Monroe doctrine of the 1820s marked the United States as the guardian of all of the Americas, closing them to further european colonization. This doctrine initially met with skepticism, eventually led to recognition of american hegemony in the Americas. Manifest destiny, which im sure youve all heard of, originally envisioned the organic spread of liberal government, democracy, secularism, and capitalism. After the Mexican American War, it evolved into a rationale for territorial expansion, exemplified by President Polk's declaration following the acquisition of the American Southwest from Mexico that gold had been discovered in California only after american acquisition because of manifest destiny. The union's victory in the Civil War set the stage for the United States to emerge as a major industrial power, resolving the economic rivalry between the north and the south. The South essentially became an internal colony, providing labor and resources to the North's industrial endeavors. One of the Civil War's most significant outcomes was the definitive answer to whether a state could secede from the union affirming the supremacy of the national government. Despite the abolition of slavery and the introduction of amendments aimed at establishing racial equality, the United States continued to struggle with racism, notably through Jim Crow laws that legally enforced racial segregation. In the latter part of the 19th century, America turned its focus beyond the north american continent, marking the beginning of american imperialism. This period saw the United States joining the ranks of imperialist powers like England and France, albeit with a distinct approach from european colonialism. The United States seldom ruled its client states directly, but maintained control over foreign economies using a practice we call economic imperialism. In the period immediately following the civil war, the United States develops into what will eventually be the world's most technologically advanced and powerful industrial nation on earth. The United States will join the ranks of imperial powers and become a force to be reckoned with by economic and ideological foes. At the same time, the people of the United States will be continuously forced to deal with unhealed wounds and unanswered questions that still haunt us today. I hope that by the end of this course you will have a better understanding of who we are as Americans so that we can build a better and more just future.",111

","At the same period of time that we see this kind of evolution in science against the church, we also see, well, we see all these religious wars, and people, some educated people, intellectual people, who we call philosophs, are going to come to believe that the problem, that's what's causing all these problems is the church and the king, right, or the monarchy and the. And the clergy, right? When we talked about the three estates, right, and it's the monarchy and the clergy who are causing all the problems, right? And so, as I already mentioned to you guys, you start, these guys start to say, well, what we're getting from these religious leaders and from these bickle leaders is not the truth. So where do we get the truth? We get it from reason, right? And so what will happen is that these people will start to apply the principles of science to other areas of study, like. Like politics. Okay? And that's where we're going to start to see the. The movement towards reason as the basis for truth. Okay? So now there's. I put a few of these guys up here. We're going to talk more about them a little bit later. John Locke, as you guys have found, is going to. Is going to propose popular sovereignty versus divine right, which we'll talk about on Wednesday. Isaac Newton is going to propose scientific authority over religious authority. And then I put these other two names down here because you guys probably recognize these names. Who are they? Franklin and Jefferson. Who are they? Founding fathers. They're founding fathers. Right. What's interesting is that they were founding fathers, but they were also significant voices in the enlightenment. Okay. Or of the enlightenment. So. So Benjamin Franklin spent most of his life in Europe. He was a. He was a highly regarded scientist in Europe as a sport, kind of as. As, as proposing reason. A man of reason. And also Thomas Jefferson. Right. Thomas Jefferson. Now, interestingly, both of these guys were what they would. They were not without. It's not that they didn't believe in God. They believed in God. What they believed in was called deism. D e I s m, Deism. And the idea in Deism is that there is a God, and God created everything. But when he did, he. It was kind of like a watchmaker. He created. He created the watch and he wound it up. And then he went to Starbucks and had a cup of coffee. Right. Already, you know, heavenly Starbucks or something. You get the idea. The point here is that God created everything and he set everything in motion, but he doesn't interfere with the workings of his creation. So there, there's no, there's no supernatural. There's no miracles or anything like that. That. And because of that, you can observe what he's created and derive the truth because it never changes, right? That's what he says. Okay. All right. That's what the. That's what Deism says. And that's. That was the kind of the religion of the founders. And then. And then the other part of that religion was that God was interested in how people lived, but that the consequence of how you lived wasn't received until after you died, right? So if you lived a life that was. That was generous towards other people, then you would be rewarded after you die. Or if you lived a life that was. That was harmful to other people, then you'd be punished for that. And that's one of the reasons why Thomas Jefferson was able to write, I tremble for my country when I consider that God is just when he was writing about slavery. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, so now let's look at a couple other things that lot wrote, okay? One called the letter concerning toleration. Basically, the idea here is a letter that proposes that the government shouldn't interfere in people's religious beliefs, okay? And the reason, obviously, for this is because there's a lot of warfare going on. People are killing each other over religion, okay? And what he's saying here is that religion is superstition. That anybody wants to believe in religion is kind of insane. But if they do want to believe in religion, just let them. It doesn't have anything. It doesn't have any effect on the rest of society. So the government should let people follow whatever superstition they want, essentially is going to be what he writes here. And you know what's interesting about this is that this is going to become the foundation for our idea of religious toleration or secularism, basically separation of church and state. But the state had been trying to enforce religious beliefs for a long time in Europe, and now we're saying, well, the government shouldn't do that. Government should stay out of religion. And that's going to be kind of the american response. Okay. Questions? Comments? This next one is also very interesting. It's an essay concerning human understanding written in 1689. Keep in mind that this is also written about the same time. But this is really interesting because what Locke is trying to describe is how do people become who they are? Okay? So basically, how do we gain understanding? Okay? And the biblical view of this is, is that human beings are born with stain on their soul, right? Called immacula. Immacula. Macula. If you guys have ever heard of immaculate, what that means is without stain, okay? But humans are born with a macula, and that makula keeps them from being able to be in communion with God. And the christian religion says that human beings can't do anything to get rid of that stain, but Jesus Christ can cover the stain so that when God looks at the human, he doesn't see the stain. Now, that's way oversimplified, okay? And the point here is that I'm not trying to talk about theology. I'm trying to talk about what these people understood and how they understood it. And particularly, how can we understand human understanding without God, right? And so what John Locke proposes is that instead of human beings being born with a stain, that a human being is born as a blank slate. A blank slate. Okay? Tabula raza. Tabula raza. T a b u l a r a s a. Tabula Raza. Blank slate. Okay? And what that means is, like, say, for example, this is our chalkboard. Arasa. Our table is this chalkboard, right? And if we looked at this chalkboard without any writing on it at all, that would be a Human being when he's born, or she, right. That there's. That there's absolutely nothing there. And that how human beings develop is based on their experiences. So the idea being then, as each thing that they experiences writes something on their slate so that by the time they become adults, their. Their slates are representative of all the experiences that they've had since they were born. Are you following me here? Okay, so now, if the experiences that they've had since they were born were sad, tragic, brutal experiences, then have sad, tragic, brutal people, right? And that's what. That's what Locke and the other enlightenment thinkers believed, was that people were sad, tragic, and brutal, right? And. But because this sadness, tragedy, and brutality comes from experience, it follows that if you can control the experience of the human being, then you can control what gets written on the slate. And instead of having a sad, tragic, brutal human being, we can create a happy, generous human being. So, basically, the idea here then, is that if you can control the experiences of human beings, you can create a kind of generous human being, and that would end up with a kind and generous society rather than a brutal society, which is what they lived in. Okay? Or they saw it. And so what we have then, as the foundation of the Enlightenment project is the idea that through science and education, human beings will be able to create their own paradise without God. Okay? So basically, then, through science and education, mankind can achieve liberation and enlightenment. And God's not in there, right? You can have a God if you want one, but that's got nothing to do with human beings living on earth according to the Enlightenment thinkers. You guys get what I'm saying here? Questions? Comments? Okay, so now it's just important for us to understand the relationship of the Enlightenment thinkers and their ideas about religion, because the Enlightenment was really an anti clerical movement. It was against religion, really. Right? It was a way to try to explain everything without religion. Let me just show you this. This is a little slide I put together. This is talking about the intellectual movement I just described from the pre modern period to the modern period or the enlightenment. And what we see is the foundation of truth changes from religion to science. The basis of truth changes from faith to reason, and the language of truth changes from the Bible to mathematics, right? Okay, now when we look at this chart, we see this line, we say, okay, now we believe in the Bible. Now we believe in mathematics. Now we believe in faith. Now we believe in reason. But really, what this is, is a long, slow process, right? So one of the things that you will notice, for example, if you study the american writings, is that american writings start off being very, very religious, and in the end are less and less religious. And that's true with american society, too. American society starts off being very, very religious, but it ends up being, in many ways anti religious. Right? So you see that movement from one to the other, okay? But it happens over time. So it's not like there was a moment when this happened and everything changed. Okay, because you can still today see traces of the old medieval idea in american society, christendom. You can still see it in certain places. Right, okay. Questions? Comments? Wasn't a large part of the shift away from it being super religious based, too, is because of how many people came here to escape religious prosecution for being various religions. So they had to move away from it. So that way it was more inclusive of like, hey, half of us came here to get away from being told what religion we can and can't be. We shouldn't have this in our law. That's not exactly accurate. It is accurate that they came to escape religious persecution. But if you look at, for example, the Congregationalists, the Puritans that came to New England, they came to escape persecution in England, but they were not tolerant of any other religion than their own. So they wanted freedom, religion for themselves, but not for anybody else. And for example, if you were a Catholic or a Quaker and you went into Boston, you would be arrested, probably beaten and maybe hung for having the wrong religion. So they wanted freedom of religion, but they were not tolerant. Same thing in Maryland. Maryland was founded as a haven for Catholics in England. Right. But very quickly, the attention started to develop between Catholics and Anglican Protestants in Maryland. And really, what caused the american colonies to tolerate religion was a decree of parliament that said that you couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't. You had to tolerate other people's religion, essentially. So it was actually something was imposed on Americans by England. Okay. Does that answer your question? Yeah, I do think it's kind of ironic that they're like, yeah, we came here to get away from religious prosecution, but if you're anything but us, screw you. Well, that sounds a lot like our society today, too, in a way, doesn't it?",112

","I want to look here, and we're going back now to the fifth century, which is the 400s, right? And what had happened by then was that the Roman Empire had been split into two, okay? The Western Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire, okay? Even though they were both, at this point, ruled by the same emperor, what eventually would happen would be that the western empire broke away from the eastern empire, okay? And the western empire was located in. Well, theoretically in Rome, but it was actually in other places, particularly northern Italy. The eastern empire was located in a place called Byzantium, or Constantinople, which was here. It's where Istanbul is today. Right? And what happened in 476, when I said that the Roman Empire was the city of Rome was sacked by barbarians, is that in the early dec. Early centuries of the. Of the common era, the ad period, there was a massive income, immigration, I guess you could say, or invasion in some cases, of barbarians from Asia. And these barbarians would come into areas that had been. That were ruled by the Romans. And these areas that were ruled by the Romans were very enticing for migratory barbarians because they were rich, and so they could. They could move in and they could take the stuff that the Romans had been. Had created, and it was like a ready made kind of income for them. Okay? So when I said that the city of Rome was sacked in 476, what really had happened had been that the barbarians had taken over most of the western empire already. Okay? And the roman authority. The authority of the roman empire, really, at that point, was gone. Okay? Now, what do I mean by that? Well, you know, when we think about an empire or any government, even our own government, right? The government exists for a reason. It doesn't just exist just so they can tell people what to do. The purpose of the government is to protect the people, all right? And the people generally allow the government to work as long as it's doing the things that needs to be done, like, you know, making sure everybody gets food, make sure there's access to food, make sure that people are safe, make sure that the garbage is picked up, you know, make sure that public works are available, there's roads and things like that, right? And that's what the Roman Empire did. The administration of the Roman Empire did that, okay? But when the roman authority, the political authority, disappeared, there was really nobody to do that around through the empire you guys are living. And so what happened was there was really only one institution in what was left of the western empire that had the reach to perform the functions of government, and that was the papacy, the roman church. All right? And so what happened was that the Roman Church, the pope, actually assumed political rule over much of Europe. Okay? And this is what we call the Middle Ages. It's the otherwise known as the christian era. Right. And that's why when we come here, we look at medieval. That means middle period. Right. Middle ages, christian era. Right. So. And what that really means is that the kind of cultural atmosphere, I guess you could say, of Europe became very religious, religiously oriented. Okay. And it's different. That was different from what had been before. Okay? So in the classical period, there had been, you know, high art, there had been literature. There was, you know, painting, sculpture, architecture, law, all kinds of, you know, human creativity, as well as the. The celebration of life. So I'll get you in just a second. As well as the celebration of life. So the classical period was kind of like a celebration of living on earth in a way. Okay. I mean, it wasn't like that for everybody. There was obviously slavery and there were people that were poor and there were wars and things like that. But in general, people thought of their existence as being centered here on earth, and that the kind of the purpose of that would be to enjoy our lives as best we could. Okay. Yes. You have a question, Kelly? So this is just like, does the dark ages? Is that because. Isn't that around the time of bubonic plague? Isn't that why it's like, also known as dark ages? No, it's not. I'm going to get to that in just a few minutes. Okay? So hold that question. If I don't answer it, then ask me again in 15 minutes. Okay. All right. So can I ask you a quick question? Oh, sure, yeah, go ahead. How come the. Why did the barbarians not take over the church as well? Well, they weren't interested in, essentially, in any of the religious activities. And one of the things that you're going to, what we're going to see here as I talk today, is that the church was fundamental to the. All of society. Right? So no one would have been able to just usurp the role of pope and say, okay, I'm. I'm, you know, Genghis Khan and I'm now your pope. Nobody would have bought it. Right. The people were very, very grounded in their religious identity, and they would not have acknowledged anybody else's rule over the church other than the church hierarchy. Does that answer your question? Yeah, it's interesting. The church didn't have resources that were worth trying to capture. Well, in theory, no. The churches, all their property was essentially the churches and the monasteries. Right. And there was some wealth in there, but most of the wealth was in the hands of the ruler, whoever the ruler was. Does that make sense? Yeah, it's interesting. It's like, I wonder how much history would have changed if they would have dismantled the, you know, the church at the time as well as the whole empire. Well, you know, that is an interesting question. One of the things that we often do that we often wonder, well, what would have happened if, you know, this would have happened? What would have happened if the south won the civil war or whatever. And it's an interesting exercise, but it's not something that we can really deal with in history, because history is about what did happen, not what might have happened. You know what I'm saying? So, you know, like I said, it's interesting. And there actually is branch of so called history called counterfactualism that does study that sort of thing, but we're not going to be doing much of it here in this class. Okay, thanks for bringing up that. Bringing that up. Okay, so we all set to move forward now. We got to the point where the church basically is ruling what was left of the roman empire. Okay. But by ruling it, what I mean is that they're providing government services, but they're also the center of learning. Right. And they're integral into everybody's lives, and they kind of set the tone for society. So what we see happening here is that from the classical period when life was more centered on enjoying earthly pleasures, we move to the medieval period where life is more concerned with the afterlife. What's going to happen next? Right? And there becomes this sense that our lives here on earth are just an exile from our true home, which is in heaven. And our purpose here on earth is to survive this veil of tears so that we can get to heaven and then enjoy. Enjoy life for eternity. You guys follow? I'm saying? All right, so then that is going to be a major redirection in cultural knowledge at that point.",112

","In this lecture, we will establish a framework for studying us history from the civil war onwards, focusing on four central themes, mission and manifest destiny. Industrialization, imperialism and race. We cannot understand us history without taking into consideration the concept of mission. This notion traces back to the christian church's formative years, emphasizing the spread of the gospel. Mission became a hallmark of european identity, particularly during the Middle Ages. During this period, Europe was less developed than other regions like China, India, or even West Africa. Nevertheless, they were convinced of a God given obligation to spread what they considered their superior civilization, Christianity. By 1900, this once less prominent region had remarkably transformed into the center of global power, a shift we will explore throughout this course. Originally, the mission was religious. The Spanish, for instance, brought Christianity to America, intertwining their pursuit of wealth with religious evangelization. This pattern of religious and economic motives also characterized british colonization in North America, where the pilgrims sought to create a model christian society, a city upon a hill. The Enlightenment marked a significant shift. It brought about a questioning of traditional christian doctrines and the authority of the church. The American Revolution reflects this Enlightenment spirit, founding a nation on principles of democracy, secularism, and capitalism. These elements formed the foundation of classical liberalism or liberty. In our course's context, this new mission was no longer about spreading religious beliefs but promoting Enlightenment ideals of governance and society. Essentially, America's mission was, and in many ways continues to be, spreading and defending democracy. Manifest destiny initially symbolized an inevitable global shift towards governance models like that of the United States. However, during the mexican american war, it took on a more aggressive tone, suggesting a divine right to territorial expansion. This shift reflected both idealistic aspirations and pragmatic justifications for territorial acquisitions, such as the case of California during the gold rush. The idea that manifest destiny can be stated as America's God given right to overspread the continent is an oversimplification. Industrialization the transformation from agrarian to manufacturing economies began in England in the late 18th century and spread to the US in the early 19th century. This period saw the north industrialize rapidly while the south remained predominantly agrarian. The diverging economic paths contributed to tensions leading to the civil war. After the war, the industrialized north and the agrarian south faced distinct economic challenges, with the south becoming a resource provider for the north. By the 20th century, the US had emerged as a leading industrial power, a status that became widely recognized after World War one. The US did not build a vast overseas empire in less developed areas, as did european powers, notably Britain and France. The main reason for this is that the US had access to all of the resources it needed on the north american continent. It didn't need to build an empire because it already had one. In the late 19th century, when the US did begin overseas expansion, it predominantly practiced a form of economic imperialism, influencing other nations economies without direct governmental control. This imperialism was driven by industry and supported by the mission of spreading civilization and enlightenment. In us history, the concepts of race and privilege are deeply intertwined and complex. It's crucial to distinguish between racism and bigotry. Racism in the american context has often been based on the presupposition of inherent unchangeable defects attributed to certain racial groups, most notably African Americans. This form of discrimination is rooted in the belief in an inherent inferiority based on immutable biological characteristics such as skin color. Such beliefs have historically led to systemic and enduring forms of discrimination and inequality. In contrast, bigotry, while also a form of discrimination, is generally based on cultural, religious, or social differences that are perceived as changeable. For example, Irish Americans faced significant bigotry in the past, largely due to religious and cultural differences. Over time, as these immigrant groups assimilated and their religious and cultural differences became less pronounced or deemed less significant in the broader society, they were able to overcome much of the ostracization they initially faced. Understanding this distinction is vital in exploring the historical and contemporary dynamics of race in the United States. While the civil rights movement and subsequent legislative changes have addressed legal inequalities, the legacy of racism based on perceived inherent differences continues to pose significant challenges. This enduring issue reflects a history where certain groups have been marginalized not just for changeable cultural characteristics, but for inherent qualities, leading to a more deep seated and persistent form of discrimination. We will delve deeper into these themes, starting with industrialization, to understand their profound impact on american history and society. This exploration will provide insights into the complexities and contradictions of the american experience.",112

","The other thing that goes along with that is that when we talked about earlier the importance of the individual, if we go back to the classical period, we know who made much of the architecture, we know who made the art, we know who wrote the chronicles and the laws, and we know who ruled and things like that. But once we get to the medieval period, individuals kind of disappear from history. There are a few, you know, the kings and stuff like that. But for the most part, people as individuals are not really important. And instead of that, what they are is members of corporations. All right? Now, again, we think about a corporation, we think of, you know, McDonald's or GM or something like that. But corporation comes from the latin word corpus, which means body, right? And what happened during the Middle Ages is that european society, western european society, divided itself up into three different bodies, all right? And these bodies will come to be known as the three estates, all right? And let me just go quickly through who these were and what was their relation, right? You'll notice I numbered them one, two, three. And the number one is what's called the Bellatores, or the nobles or the aristocracy. Bellatori means war. Er, person who does war, right? And these are going to be the knights and the kings and these guys. And their purpose in life is to protect. Okay? So in society. So their idea that. The idea is that they protect the other two corporations or bodies or estates, all right? So their job is to protect the clergy and the peasants. Okay? You guys got that? Questions? Comments? All right, the second one I labeled here is the oratores. And oratores means prayers, right? So the idea of a prayer. The idea here is that the person who's in this corporation or in this estate is necessary for the mediation of salvation, okay? Which means the kind of theology of the time was that the only way that you can be saved and get to heaven is through the church. And so the church became the mediator of salvation. And their job was to mediate salvation for everybody else, for themselves and everybody else, right? So the priests and the bishops and the pope all were in the business of mediating salvation for themselves and the nobles and the peasants. All right, you guys got that? So then the last group is what the. What we call the obra dores. Obra dores means workers. And they basically, when we talk about a worker during the middle ages, we're really only thinking about people who work the land, right? So we're talking about peasants, basically that in theory, that, not in practice, but in theory, all work was done on the land. And so it was agrarian work. Okay? So basically their job was to go out and furnish food, physical support for themselves and everybody else, right? So the Obradorians then would provide, would grow food for themselves and for the clergy and also for the nobles. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? So what you see here is a very elegantly balanced society. Everybody has a place, and every place has a purpose, and every place also receives benefit from the others, right? So the nobles receive. The nobles provide protection for themselves and everybody else, but they receive physical support from the peasants and salvation from the clergy. And you can go around this circle and see that in every case. You guys see what I'm saying? And this was very fixed. All right? So if you were the only one that really wasn't fixed was this. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second, right? But if you were born into a noble family, you were always going to be a noble. You could never become anything else except that you might go into the clergy, because a lot of the nobles who didn't inherit land ended up going into the clergy, which is one of the reason. Oh, sure. Okay, so which is one of the reasons why the clergy, by the time we're done today, is going to be corrupt, right? Because they're made up of essentially nobles, right. But if you were a peasant, you were always going to be peasant. You could never become a noble, maybe become a member of the clergy, but not likely, right? Right. And so when you were, when you came, when you come into existence in one of these bodies, it tells you everything you need to know about yourself, right? So if you're a peasant, it tells you where you're going to be born, who your parents are going to be, what kind of education you're going to get, if you get one, who you owe allegiance to, where you go to church, when you go to church, who you're going to marry, what kind of parties you go to, where you're going to be buried, all this is all already predetermined. Nobody in, say, 13th century France ever said, if I work really hard, maybe I can become king. What's going to happen? Nobody even thought of it. The idea of social mobility wasn't something that anybody ever thought of. And for that reason, this structure of society lasts for a long time, right? The Middle Ages, we'll say, really ends up being about 1000 years. Okay, so a little. So when you look, go back to look at our timeline, then where we are here, we go back to look at our timeline here, you'll see that we say that the beginning of the Middle ages was in 476. The end of the middle ages is in 1453. Okay, you guys are all with me. Questions? Comments? So we have a very stable setup. The one thing I want to mention, though, is that, like I already mentioned, this setup is a. Is a. Is a theory. Is in theory, okay. It's a construction. And so when we look at medieval society, people in the Middle Ages would have seen society this way to some extent, but it really wasn't ever exactly that way. Right. It was more of an ideal than it was a reality. And as time went by, this ideal becomes further and further from reality. So by the time we get to the 15th century, the nobles are not really protecting anybody anymore. They're just basically out for themselves, and they're milking the peasants to get it. And the clergy are basically off in Rome having parties and. And creating a hereditary papacy, and. And they're not really looking after the well being salvation of their supposed flock. And again, they're the ones who are milking the peasants. So basically, the nobles and the clergy have become corrupt, and the peasants are being forced to pay for it all. Do you guys get what I'm saying? And that's going to be what the situation is by the time we get to the 15th century. Okay, you guys with me? And one of the things that's going to be interesting is that even though everybody knows what the ideal is, everybody's also going to know that it's a fiction, right? That the. Especially the peasants, they'll know that they're getting screwed. Okay, you have to ask the question then. Well, if they know they're getting taken advantage of, why did they go along with it? They were ruled over brutally. And that anybody who opposed the supposed social order would be very painfully done away with. Publicly and painfully done away with. So that there was a real reason not to challenge the authority both the church and the nobles had that kind of life and death authority over the peasants. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments?",113

","Now, I've got one other thing I want to talk about, and that is everybody's favorite capitalism right now. We're going to talk more about this starting next week. Right? But as I mentioned to you guys last week, Europe was backwards compared to the rest of the world in, say, 1500, right? But what changed everything was the discovery of America. Because with the discovery of America, Europeans were able to, they gained access to resources that made them incredibly wealthy, right? So in the beginning, it was Spain. Spain was able to extract silver, other things, but mostly silver, from America. And that gave them enough money to perpetuate these religious wars because Spain was super Catholic, right? And they were fighting religious wars throughout Europe based on the money that they got from the new world. Okay? And then after another hundred years or so, the other european powers, particularly France and England, are going to gain footholds in America and they'll be able to extract that wealth. But the wealth that they extract isn't going to be used for fighting wars. It's going to be used for making people rich. All right? So now if we go to thinking about the feudal system that I described to you last week, and we said that the land tenure system was based on land, that land was wealth. And who owned the land? Do you guys remember the king? The king, right. So what does that mean? That means that the king is the one who has all the money. Okay. All right. So at any rate, the point here is that the basis of wealth is going to be real estate, essentially, right? And because there's, the basis of wealth is land, and hardly anybody can own land, then hardly anybody really has wealth. All right? And not only that, but the amount of wealth that there is is limited because there's only so much land, you can't create land, right? And so once it's all owned, then the only way you can get any of it from any more of it is to take it from somebody else, right? And that's one of the reasons why the Europeans were always at war with each other, right? But because it all is owned by the king, the king says, okay, well, I'm going to, I'm going to tightly control commerce to make sure that all the wealth comes to me, right? Or to my favorites. All right? And what happens then is that when they discover America, then what they really discovered was a vast, empty landscape. What's wrong with that? It's not empty. It's not empty, but from the european point of view, it might as well be empty because they say it's ours. Okay, we'll talk more about why they think that later. But the point here is that the Spanish then gain certain amounts of territory here. Basically, the idea is that the Americas are a big pile of money, right? And so let's think about now. If we were all sitting in the classroom and some of us were looking out the window and somebody came with a forklift and dropped off a pallet of $100 bills in the quad, right? And we looked out the window and said, hey, look, somebody dropped off a pallet of a $100 bills, right? What would we do? Right. Well, we'd sit quietly until the end of class. No, we wouldn't do that. We'd trample over each other to run outside to grab as much money as we could and to do whatever we had to to hold onto it, right? And that's exactly what the Europeans did when they found America. They found this big pile of money, and they did whatever. They trampled over each other to gain as much of it as they could. And then they did what they could to hold on to it, right? And this is what's called mercantilism. Mercantilism means that the output, the resources of the new world are the wealth of the nation. It belongs to the nation. And that means that that wealth of the nation should remain in the nation. And that creates a trading system where you can only trade with other parts of your own empire, right? So it means that all of the goods from. From the orange section here have to go to England, right. All of the resources from the blue area has to go to France. All of the resources from the green area have to go to Spain. But let's think about this for a minute. Now, if we look, there's. There's. This is hard to see, but there's a little island here called espanola. It's called Santo Domingo now, right? But on this island, there's an area called Saint Domingue. Saint Domingue is a french colony, and they grow sugar there. And most of the sugar before it's shipped back to Europe is turned into rum. Okay? And then there's a british colony over here that we call South Carolina. And what they grow in South Carolina is rice, and lots of it. Right, okay, so now, so now somebody tell me, what do you do with rum? You drink it. You drink it. Exactly. And what do you do with rice? You eat it. You eat it. Okay. Right. So now let's ask this question. Do you think that people in Haiti like to eat? Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that people in South Carolina like to drink rum. Yeah. Yeah. So wouldn't it make sense for the people in San Domingue and the people in South Carolina to trade? Yeah, it would. Right. But they can't, because the mercantile system says that if I'm in Haiti or Saint Domingue and I want rice, it has to go from South Carolina to England to France and then back to Saint Domingue. And the same thing with rum going the other way has to go from Saint Domingue to France to England and then back to America. You guys get what I'm saying? So now that's really good for the mother country, because the mother country is making profit off everything that's produced in the colonies. Right? But it's really bad for the colonies. Right? So let's think about this for a second. When you guys, some of you guys have read Locke. What does Locke say the purpose of government is? Purpose of government is to protect property. Property. Exactly. So what that means is that the government is supposed to protect your property, but if there's a government policy that makes it necessary for you to have to pay more for goods, is that protecting your property or is that taking your property away? Right. It's taking your property away. Right. And that's going to be the basis for the american revolution is because Americans will come to believe that the government is taking away their property without their consent. Okay, we'll talk more about that starting a couple weeks from now anyway. All right, so that's mercantilism. What happens is in 1776, there's going to be a scottish philosopher, I guess, named Adam Smith, and he's going to write a book called an Inquiry into the nature and causes of wealth of nations, which becomes the basis for capitalism. Right? And the idea behind capitalism is that. And the reality is that over time, the nature of wealth, because there's so much land, it makes it possible for people to create lots of wealth without very much land. And so the basis of wealth changes from land to capital. What is capital? It's money. Right? Okay. Now, because the basis of wealth is capital rather than land, basically, that means that the amount of wealth that's available is unlimited. And so Smith's idea is going to be, well, if the amount of wealth is unlimited, then what you should do is let the people pursue their own enlightened self interest. And by doing that, they'll make themselves wealthy, and they'll make society wealthy as well. Right? So it's kind of like the republican phrase, a rising tide lifts all boats, right? If you let people make money they'll make money for themselves and they'll also employ people and pay taxes. Right. Everybody's going to get wealthier, but in order for that to happen, you have to let them go. Laissez faire, let it go, or actually means hands off or let it be. The point here is that there's a new way of thinking about trade, and that is rather than having trade being tightly controlled by the government, that you should just let it go and that the result will be eventually that everybody will become more wealthy. All right. Does that make sense, you guys? This has all been critiqued, and we can talk more about this later. But the main thing here is that if we think about the first country in the world that ever adopted the idea of free trade, what country do you think it was? United States. Exactly. United States is the first country in the world based on the idea, whose economy was based on the idea of capitalism or free trade. So one of the things that we've been able to do, then this morning, if you guys remember, I talked on last week about liberty with an exclamation point saying that was classical liberalism and it had three components, and the three components were democracy, secularism and capitalism. Right. We have seen the development of all three of those things in Europe before the founding of America. Right. But they aren't actually implemented in any place until the founding of America.",113

","Let's move forward. Okay. We said that we basically been talking about the Roman Empire, the fall of the Roman Empire in the Middle Ages, and we talked about this western history timeline. And when we looked at the Roman Empire, we said that the western empire fell, but the eastern empire remained. Okay? And that actually was true. The different. The thing is, though, that as time went by, even though this empire, which was, which came to be known as the Byzantine Empire after Byzantium, even though it remained a christian empire, it became, it really deviated from the roman empire in terms of its culture. All right, so. So the culture of the Roman Empire really continued to live in the eastern roman empire, even though it was a christian empire. Okay? So basically, when we look at the medieval period, one of the reasons why it's called the Dark Ages is because by the time we get to the end of the medieval period, many skills and arts that were known during the classical period had been lost. For example, during the classical period, the Romans had been able to build arches and domes, but by the end of the medieval period, they had forgotten how to build arches and domes. And so people later on would look back at that and say, well, this was a period when the knowledge was lost, okay? And so basically, the idea then would be that western Europe had regressed and moved backwards in terms of development. But that didn't happen in the east. Okay? What happened in the east was that the scholars in the clergy. Right, were able to maintain all that knowledge throughout the period, even though they were pressured in the 13th century by the Mongols, and then later in the 8th century or earlier in the 8th century by the Muslims. And the empire itself continued to shrink, so that by the time we got to 1453, the only thing that was really left of the empire was the city of Byzantium itself. Okay, so we'll just leave it at that. So, so that's. We're going to say now we're up to the year 1453. Before I move on, any questions? You guys are all still with me. So keep in mind that the western empire has fallen. The eastern empire is. Is also falling, but they have maintained the knowledge of the classical period. I have a question. Okay, good. Go. Tell me. So. Well, I don't. I'm not sure how related it is, but you were talking about how they. They forgot how to make those arches. Yeah. I was wondering, how does one forget, like, I guess I'm kind of wondering how certain methods and technologies are lost in time. Like, like when they sent, uh, like when we went to the moon and they were like, oh, we don't have that tech anymore. It's like, wait, what do you mean? Like. Like, how did they forget? You know what I mean? Okay, let me. I can give you a clue. I'm not, you know, I don't have a definitive answer for that, but I can give you a clue. What's your major? Right now I'm looking. I'm kind of undecided, but I'm kind of looking into biology. Okay. Biology. Right. Now, if you were going to go to work as a biologist, would you be able to just go into a lab and start working as a biologist? No, I have to learn all the stuff. You'd have to learn everything. Right. And what happened during the medieval period is that nobody was being taught those things. They still existed in books. Right. But nobody was being educated in those things, so that's why they didn't know how to do it. Does that make sense? Oh, yeah, yeah. I see. Yeah. It's kind of like, you know, if. Well, there's a lot of things like people. Like, I mean, people used to know intuitively how to make candles. Do you know how to make a candle? Most people don't, because there's no need to do it anymore. Nobody's educated anymore. You know what I'm saying? You just want a candle, you just go buy one. Right? Does that make sense? So I think that's really what the answer is to that. Questions? Comments? Any other questions? All right, so now here's where everything kind of starts to change. All right, let me go back here. All right, so, in 1453, remember I told you that the Roman Empire was shrinking? It was being challenged by a group known as the Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman Turks came from this area over here, but they started to spread throughout this area. Actually, they built what would become known as the Ottoman Empire, which we'll talk about maybe a little bit later. But it. It grew slowly, and it was a result of warfare against the christian empire that lasted over a couple of centuries. Okay, so that means that even though this knowledge of the classical era was being kept here in the east, it wasn't a time of peace and prosperity. It was a time of challenge in warfare. Right. And let me just ask you. I already told you. Who was it that was keeping all this knowledge? The nobility and the clergyman. Well, mostly the clergyman. Right. But it would be the scholars. Right, the scholars. Okay, so now let's think about it. Now, let's imagine that we're sitting in a classroom at Mesa college, and we look out the window and in the courtyard, somebody's out there with an AR 15, starts shooting people. Right? What are we going to do? We're scholars, right? So what are we going to do? Are we going to go out there and. And, you know, try to stop him, or are we going to go out there and try to, you know, just record what's happening? We get our phones out and start videotaping. What do you think we're going to do? Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to run away, right? I'm going to run away if there's. If there's a lot of. If there's violence going on, and I'm not a violent person. Don't even know how to do violence, right? And if there's violence going on, as a scholar, I'm not going to stay there. Stick around. I'm leaving. I'm out of there, right? I'm going to run away. Okay. And that's the situation we have here in the eastern empire. By the middle of the 15th century, there's so much disruption that the scholars have decided to run away. Kind of like a medieval brain drain. Right? But now, if you're going to run away, where are you going to go? Okay, well, you're not going to go up here because it's full of barbarians and you'll get killed. You're not going to go down here because it's Muslim. And even though Muslims sometimes are tolerant of Christians, you wouldn't be able to. To practice the way you wanted to. So the only place where a christian scholar could go really, would be where? To the west. Right? And so we saw a movement of scholars from the east to the west. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? And then finally, just let me point out to you the date here. I think May 23, 1453, the last. The city of Constantinople was sacked by the Ottomans. And the last roman empire, John was beheaded in his head, placed on a pike at the front gate of the city of what would become Istanbul. And that was the actual end of the Roman Empire. Okay? So it took about 1000 years for it to completely fall. But the main thing to say here is that the knowledge of the classical east had now migrated. Oh, sorry, I'm going the wrong way. Had now migrated to the west, because when these scholars fled to the. To the west, what did they take with them? Their knowledge, their Christianity? Their knowledge. Exactly. And so what we see happening then is a rebirth of classical knowledge in the west. Does anybody know what the french word for rebirth is Renaissance. Renaissance, exactly. So there's a renaissance, and this is the beginning of the Renaissance. And the Renaissance essentially is the reintroduction of classical knowledge into western Europe. Okay, you guys are with me. The reason why that's important for us is because it's going to break that very stable social structure that existed. It's going to break it because what's going to happen is that the knowledge of that period, the Christianity of that period, is going to be questioned for a number of different reasons, and it will break the church. Okay. And when the church is broken, that's going to lead to a significant reorientation of society. That's what's called the Renaissance. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about that?",114
13,"US1: 115 -US1: 115
","Okay, so now we're done with this slide. Let me move on here. One of the major consequences of the Renaissance. Actually, there's two. Right. The first one, though, I want to mention, is that what we see happening is I move away from corporatism, meaning a move away from the idea of society divided into three estates. Okay? It will continue to be that way, theoretically, all the way up until the time of the french revolution. Right. But in reality, what we'll see happening is that individual people come to be appreciated in themselves more than just by the group that they're born into. Okay, so it's important then, to consider that each individual now becomes significant in western life, rather than just significant as a member of a body. Does anybody want to guess why that is? Why it's important? Let's go back to the Middle Ages here just for a second, and we'll look at these three estates. They used to have things. In fact, they did have these all the way up until the French Revolution. They had these things called the estates general. And the estates general were a meeting of the three estates where they would get together and decide on things like raising taxes. Like, say the king wanted to raise taxes, right? So if the king wants to raise taxes, in theory, he can't do that without the permission of the estates general, right? So he calls together the estates general, and they say, we're going to vote on it. Okay, but keep in mind there's only three votes. There's one vote for the nobles, one vote for the clergy, and one vote for the peasants, right? So the nobles say, hey, if we raise taxes, you know, you guys are going to get part of it. And so they. So they say, okay, so let's vote. So are you in favor? Yes. Are you in favor? Yes. Are you in favor? No. Well, too bad you lose. Even though there may have been maybe millions of these, but. And maybe hundreds of these, right? It doesn't matter because there's only three votes and your vote doesn't count. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Now you're saying that now because there's individuals, more individual kind of influence is kind of like that led to democracy? Well, it leads to the idea of one person, one vote, or popular sovereignty. Right? You know what? I'm looking at the readout here, and it says popular software team. But that's not what we're talking about. Popular sovereignty. Right. Not popular sovereign fund either. Okay. At any rate, let's keep going. So, yeah, the importance of the individual is fundamental to our society, because our basic premise is that each person has a voice in the government through their vogue. Do you guys get what I'm saying? And if we were all corporatists, we wouldn't have that, that vote, right? So it's very important. All right? But now let's. We're going to talk a little bit about religion. And let me just mention to you guys, and I'm not trying to tell you guys anything about religion. I'm not trying to convince you guys anything, either for or against religion or for or against any kind of religion. I'm only telling you the effect that it had on our history. Okay? So let's talk about it a little bit. The catholic idea was that the church was necessary for the mediation of salvation. Basically, the only way you could get to church, to siri, sorry, to heaven, was by. Through the sacraments. And the sacraments could only be administered by the church. And so if you wanted to go to heaven, you had to be in good relationship with the church. Nobody could get to heaven without that relationship with the church. Okay? There was a monk in the 15th century. His name is Martin Luther. You guys have probably heard of him. It's not Martin Luther King. Martin Luther King is not going to be in his course, okay? Martin Luther is. He's a different guy altogether. Okay? And he was a german monk, and he came up with the idea. He was a very troubled man. He was a. What's the word I'm looking for? He was very. He was very concerned about how he was going to get to heaven, because he believed that in order to get to heaven, he couldn't be a sinner. And he knew that he was a sinner, and he couldn't figure out how he was going to be able to get past the idea of getting to heaven without being a sinner. Right. As a sinner. Okay. So what that really reveals to us then, is that the church said that you could get to heaven either by faith or by works. Okay? So faith means my belief in God, but works means the things that I do to please God. Okay? And. And Martin Luther was afraid that he was never going to be able to do enough to please God, enough to be able to get to heaven. But he was also a theologian. He was a professor of theology, and he studied the scriptures. And his idea that he got from the scriptures, particularly from reading the letter to the Romans, was that the church wasn't necessary for salvation, that the only way that you could gain salvation was by faith. And the only way that you could gain faith was by reading the Bible. Okay, so basically, then Martin Luther contradicts the church, who says that you can be saved by faith or by works, and says, no, you can only be saved by faith. Okay, you guys are with me, which at this point in time, you don't want to challenge the authority of the church, because the church is basically the most important institution in society, and they control your eternal salvation. They control your eternal destiny. This idea that Martin Luther had, he wasn't the first one that came up with it. There was another guy earlier. His name was Jan Hus. He was from Bavaria, I think, or Bohemia. Sorry, Bohemia. Anyway, Jan Hus also came with that idea, and he had. He grew a following called the Hussites. And the Catholic Church decided that was a threat to them. So they called him to a place called worms in Eastern Europe to explain himself. They said, come on. Come on over here and let's talk about it. And he went and he started talking about it, and they said, okay, well, here's what we're going to do with you. We're going to tie you to a stake and burn you to death, right? As an example of what happens when you disagree with the church. Okay, so this is why, even though many people had come to question the church's teachings, they didn't. You can see this, right? Because the power structure was against them. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Why did Martin Luther get away with it and not Jan hus or any of these other people? The reason why was because Martin Luther had a powerful protector. His name was Frederick III, otherwise known among Protestants circles as Frederick the wise of Saxony, and he protected Martin Luther. And so what happened was that Martin Luther was able to publish his ideas, and they were disseminated throughout Germany and northern Europe. Okay, now, one of the things that kind of goes along with this is that this happened in 1517, but in 1453, the. I think it was 1453, the printing press was introduced into Europe. Okay? So up until the time of 1453, the only way you could publish anything would be by writing handwritten copies of it. And that was one of the things that monks did in the Middle Ages, was that they would sit in their monasteries and copy bibles all day long by hand. But now, with the introduction of the printing press, it came from China. With the introduction of the printing press, they were able to widely disseminate written works. Okay, so Martin Luther's ideas were essentially a medieval example of going viral. Okay? Martin Luther's ideas went viral. Okay, you guys are all with me. On this. Questions? Comments? All right, so then what ended up happening as a result of that was that there were other people who kind of latched on to Martin Luther's ideas about reforming the church and used it as a tool for rousing the peasants to revolt. And there were peasant revolts throughout northern Europe, okay? And this was shocking to Martin Luther. Martin Luther did not want to break the church, and he didn't want to upset the social order. All he wanted to do was reform the church. That's why they call it the reformation. The ultimate outcome of it, though, was that the church was broken. And going along with the breaking of the church was the breaking of the social order. Because in the social order, the princes, the people who ruled, the people, the nobles, were all under the authority of the pope to a certain extent. Right? But now there was another alternative. You could eat. You could either be under the rule under the auspices of the pope, or you could challenge the pope, right? And by challenging the pope or threatening to challenge the pope, you could get the pope to actually comply with your wishes. Okay? So one of the things that's going to come out of this is, is the decrease in the authority of the church and the increase in the authority of the nobles. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, so let's go a little bit further down the road, and then we'll be done with this, right? That after Martin Luther, after the idea, the kind of monolithic ideas of the church were broken and people could question it, then other people started to question it. And one of the important ones of these was a guy named John Calvin. John Calvin was Swiss, actually. He was french, but he lived in Switzerland, I think. But anyway, the point here is that he went along with Martin Luther to a certain extent, but he went even further and said that, you know, the Catholic Church says you can be saved by faith and by works. Martin Luther, the lutheran church says you can be saved, you can only be saved by faith, and that you have to be able to read the Bible in order to gain that faith. But John Calvin said you couldn't be saved either by faith or by works, but you had had to be chosen or elected by God, and that had already happened before you were even born. So this is the idea of predestination, okay? And I'm not going to get into the theology of that. The main thing I want to mention about that, the reason why it's important for us is because the people who settled in New England were Calvinists, okay? So they brought with them this idea of election, and we'll talk about why that's important later. Okay. Questions, comments about that? All right, last thing, then, the council. What happens is that the church does actually reform itself at an event, I guess you could say, called the Council of Trent, which actually sounds like something that happened in three days, but I think it took 30 years or something like that. But the idea then was it was something called the counter reformation. And what happened with that was the church did reform itself, that all the priests had to actually live in the, the diocese where they were assigned, and the bishops had to live there, too. They couldn't just go to Rome and have big parties, and that everybody had to acknowledge the authority of the church. The thing that there were a lot of the abuses that Martin Luther identified were corrected. The one major difference between now Protestants and Catholics is that the Catholics still consider the church as essential to salvation, where the Protestants say, you don't need the church for salvation. Right. And that's the major kind of issue that's going to lead to all these wars and things. So we'll just leave it at that now. Right. Because that's really what the outcome of this is, that the people who followed Luther and Calvin and a number of other people who were reformers after them were viewed as heretics by the people who remained Catholic. But the Catholics were reviewed as heretics by the Protestants.",115
14,"US1: 116 -US1: 116
","Now, I want to kind of introduce something to you here. You guys probably have all heard of this, but in the United States we have what's called secularism. What is secularism? Anybody know? The United States government is a secular government. It's a non religious right that the constitution prohibits the government from establishing an official religion. Okay? That's important because what, one of the motivators of this era of religious warfare that's going to result from the reformation is that the different rulers, the different princes were able to declare for their country what their religion was, right? The principle is called quius regio ejus religio, not squeeze reggio, but anyway, quies regio eos religio, which means whoever rules chooses the religion, all right? And what that is going to mean then is that these religious differences are going to become institutionalized and nation states and become a grounding or a foundation for warfare between nation states, okay? Catholics and Protestants, all right? And this is going to be, this is going to drive european history for 150 years, okay? That the Protestants and the Catholics are going to be killing each other over what's the right religion. Okay? Second, the reason why I brought up secularism is because I could say I'm not going to, but I could say, well, what is your religion? Right? And you guys could all raise your hand and you say, well, I'm a Catholic and I'm a Baptist, and I don't believe in anything, and I'm a Jedi or whatever, right? And we could all look and say, well, that's stupid, you can't be a Jedi, whatever, right? We could say that, but we couldn't do anything about it, right? Because we have religious tolerance, religious toleration, essentially, right? Theoretically, right? Meaning that if you believe something, it's my job to let you believe that I can't kill you for it, right? I can maybe try to convince you it's wrong, but I can't kill you for it, right? But back in these days, that was your job. Your job was if somebody didn't believe the right thing, they either had to be convinced to believe the right thing or they had to be killed, one or the other, right? And that's what's going to lead to this religious warfare. Okay? Now let me just ask you this. Just give me a little. Just give a little bit of thought to this and answer me. How can somebody win a religious war? Can you conquer by force? I don't know. Well, all right, so you guys all have heard of martyrs, right? Yes. What's a martyr like when someone dies for a cause and then later they're revered. Right? Well, martyr means a witness, right? Actually, it's greek for witness, but the martyrs are the ones who say, you can't make me change my mind about my religion. You can kill me, but you can't make me change my mind. Right. So is it possible to conquer somebody into being a different religion? No. No. So how can you actually win a religious war? You kill them, kill everyone. You have to kill everyone. But you can't really kill everyone. Right. And so the end is the answer really, is that you can't. You can't win a religious war. Okay? And this is what ended up happening in Europe. Both the Protestants were trying to get rid of the Catholics, the Catholics were trying to get rid of the Protestants. And eventually there's going to be a number of people who are going to say, you know, the problem isn't Protestants versus Catholics. The problem is the christian religion itself, because the christian religion is driving people to do these atrocious things. And so what we should do is reject the christian religion altogether. Okay? And these people are going to be known as philosophs. Where are we at? I don't think I put it here, but the philosophs are going to be the people who are going to become the leaders of the Enlightenment. So you're familiar with some of their names? Rousseau, Montesquieu, Jefferson, Franklin, Locke. John Locke is one of the Enlightenment thinkers, the philosophs. Right. Diderot. There's a number of them. You may or may not be familiar with some of them and won't go over many of them. But the main point here is that their basic agreement was that it was religion that had caused all of the problems up to the point of history where they found themselves, and that the way to solve social problems was to get rid of religion. Right? Okay, you guys are volunteer, and that's going to be the basis for the enlightenment. All right, you guys got me? Questions, comments? I'm almost done. Let me just. That was actually kind of this thing down here, right? Let's just do a couple of other things. I think I've already kind of started to talk about this. The rate reformation upset the balance of power in european society. By mitigating the power of the church, the church becomes less important, the princes become more important. They also form into the first of what we will call nation states. All right. Up until this time, there hadn't been really been any nation states. If we look at this map right here, we can see in some places something that we might consider a nation or a state today, Spain, Portugal, France, England, Scotland, right? But the reality of Europe at this time was that each of these places may have had a king, but all the local areas were ruled locally, and people didn't think of themselves as French or English or Scottish or Spanish. They thought about themselves in terms of their local area, right. And that was supported by the reality that the people in these different areas didn't really even speak the same language, right? So if you lived here in Normandy, you would speak a dialect of French, but it would be a dialect that people down here in Provence were not able to understand. Okay, so there was nothing uniting these people. There was no sense of nationalism, right. None of these people thought of themselves as French. They had a king, and they owed allegiance to the french king, right? But they didn't think of themselves as French. One of the ways we know that is when the Spanish came to America, they conquered as Christians, but they didn't conquer as Spaniards. You guys get what I'm saying? So they knew they were from Spain, but they didn't think of themselves as Spanish, okay? Instead, they identified themselves as Christians. All right? Questions, comments about that? Okay, well, one of the things that happened, remember I told you that one of Luther's ideas was that in order to be able to get faith, you had to be able to read the Bible, and that meant that the Bible had to be translated into what's called the vernacular, the local language, right? And if you looked at Europe at the time of the Reformation, there were thousands of different dialects, and how could you publish the Bible in thousands of different dialects? Right? So what we saw happening then was that the printing of the Bible was accomplished by a. By creating a more common language, right? So instead of publishing the Bible in 150 different french dialects, they published it in parisian French, right? And then what that meant was that as time went by, everybody in France learned parisian French, and eventually everybody spoke parisian French. And the outcome of that then would be that now they could say that they were French because they were all speaking French. You guys get what I'm saying? So the translation of the Bible into the vernacular leads to a new sense of nationalism, which we'll talk more about at a different time. Right. And then also, if you can read the Bible, what else can you read? Books. Right. What kind of books do you think that you might be able to read in 16th century Europe? Pamphlets. Pamphlets. From who? Anyone who is able to have a printing press and, like, spread this information, either propaganda or just new ideologies, new stuff like science. Exactly. So what happens is that we see a rise in literacy. People start to be able to read, and they can read things now, like not only Martin Luther's Bible and his treatises, but they can also read, you know, John Locke and his idea of popular sovereignty, and they can read Montesquieu and Rousseau and all these other revolutionaries. Right. And so that's going to lead then to, that's going to contribute to the decline in the power of the church. So that's basically what I just talked about here. Any questions or comments about any of this?",116

","We're going to go back in time, and we're going to go all the way to the Middle Ages, and we're going to look at the land tenure system during the Middle Ages. So the land tenure system was called feudalism, and it was based on what's called the fief. Right? The fief was an area of land. Now, if we think about in a kingdom, the king owned all the land, all right? But what he did was his special people that helped him. The lords got access to certain areas of land, and the area of land that the lord would get was called a thief. Okay? Now, as far as I know, there was never a square feet anywhere in Europe. This is just a kind of a depiction of the thief, right? And what we'll see then in the thief is the social order of the Middle Ages. Right? And there's a village. Right? And then there's an area of land called the fields of the Lord. And that's where the Lord lives in his manner. Right? And the rest of the land is called commonsen. Should we be taking notes on this? We've heard of the Commons, Boston common, for example. Right? Okay. So now it works is that the Lord has access to the produce of the land. All right? What that means is that he doesn't own the land and he doesn't own the people, but he has rights to the people's labor. Okay? And as having rights to the people's labor, what that means is that the people owe him labor in return for his protection. But also being allowed to use the commons to grow their own produce. Right? So they grow grains and sheep and things like that. Right? So the, so the kind of ideal of the middle ages was that the peasants would work in the fields of the Lord and produce. Produce, right. Agricultural goods that they would sell, and then the Lord would make money off of that. And in return for that, the commoners would work in the fields for their, for their own goods. Right? Later, what happens is that the Lords will figure out they can't make very much money by selling vegetables. So they basically allow the peasants to get money however they want. And they then the peasants, instead of paying labor, they pay rent. Right. In cash. So that's why you pay rent to the landlord. Okay? You guys with me? Okay. All right. So now this is the, it's an ag, it's an agrarian system, right? And the basis of wealth here is in the land, okay? And because the land is controlled by the Lord, then that means that, um, that, uh, the lord controls essentially all the way the wealth or the other way around. Okay, you guys got this questions. Should we be taking notes on this, even though this isn't. I'm sorry, I can't hear. I'm. Can you say it again? Should we be taking notes on this? Yes, absolutely. Let me go ahead and move on then. And I'm going to say this is an agrarian system. And even though it's an agrarian system and that they. Most of the produce is agricultural, like sheep, you know, stuff like that. Right? And also. Excuse me. This system is basically is what they would call a subsistence system. And the reason why it's a subsistence system is because people make just enough for everybody to live, right? So you need everybody in the village to grow enough produce for everybody to live. All right? That's why we call it subsistence. You guys with me? Everybody's needed. All right? Okay. Now, even though it's an agrarian system, they still have industry. Okay? The industry, they have to make things, right? Some things that they need to make, like cannons and stuff like that, have to be made up in the hills because that's where the water power is, right? But stuff that you need for the home, like, you know, horseshoes and pockets and pans and hats and shoes and things like that, are made in the village in a cottage. So what that means is that the peasant will have a cottage, and in the cottage he will have a. Sorry. In the cottage he will have a safe, some kind of a tool to make something. So you might have an anvil, so you can make horseshoes or something like that, right? The example that we're going to use is going to be textiles, right? So the british empire essentially was based on woolen textiles or cotton textiles. And so let's say a textile would be something like a sweater. And if you needed a sweater made, you would go to the person who in the village who made sweaters, and that person would have a loom. And what you would do is you would tell the person, I want a sweater. And they'd measure you up, and you'd give them some money, and they'd say, okay, come back in three days or four days or whatever, right? And when you come back, then I'll give you your sweater, right? And then the person in the cottage would use the loom to create the sweater. And then when the person came back to get their sweater, they would just get a perfect sweater because it fits them perfectly because it was made just for them. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay, so. So that's what we call a cottage industry. Why do we call it cottage industry? Because it happens in the cottage, right. And in the cottage industry, we make a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Small quantity because you can only make one thing at a time. One person, one loom makes one thing. Right. High quality because it's made just for you. And reasonable price because if it wasn't reasonable, you couldn't afford it. Right? So basically, the industrial output was a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Okay? Now, one thing that we want to notice is that if I'm the peasant that owns the loom that creates the sweater, okay? What do I get in return for making that sweater? Money. Money. Profit. Money. The profit or the surplus. Right? So you buy the wool and you put your labor in. And what. And the money that's left over, that's what you get to keep. And why do you get to keep it? Because you own the loom.",121

","The discovery of America had enormous impact on Europe. Okay? And one of the main impacts of the discovery of America was that Europe started to be able to extract resources from the Americas that made Europe wealthy, right? So if you remember, I said before that the population, the economy of this system was subsistence, meaning they needed everybody to produce enough for everybody to live. It was also stagnant. The population of Europe was stagnant, really, throughout the Middle Ages. And the reason why was because they couldn't grow enough food for the population to grow. What would happen would be they'd have really good crops for a couple of years and the population would start to grow, and then they'd have bad crops and there'd be a famine and people would die off, right? So the population remained relatively stagnant over a thousand years, right? But when, after America was discovered, they introduced new crops from the Americas, like the potato, right? You wouldn't think of potatoes as being very sexy in terms of world history, right? But because of the introduction of the potato, the european population started to grow, right? And so there's going to be an increase in population in Europe as the result of the discovery of America. Beyond that, there's going to be other resources, like, for example, silver, that the Spanish are able to extract silver from Mexico. That's why there were so many miners in Mexico, right? They were able to extract silver from Mexico and Peru, and that made the spanish empire very rich. And then later the British and the French and the Dutch will get in on that as well, right? And so eventually what ends up happening is that Europeans have a very interesting cash flow problem. Cash flow problem. And the problem is they have more cash than they know what to do with. And what will. It'll start off with people, the people who are, say, plantation owners in America are going to go. They didn't go to America because they wanted to live in America. They wanted to live in Europe, right? And they wanted to live high in Europe, okay? And so what happens is that they go, they go to the Americas, they make lots of money, they go back to Europe, they buy out the old aristocracy, and then they buy their places to live, and they buy their manners, and they spend money buying positions at court, and they spend money buying art and things throughout Europe, right? And once they've done that, they own essentially everything and they still have more money than they know what to do with. And so eventually what they do is they start to invest that money in technology. There will be a creation of machines that will make production more, more productive. Manufacturing will be more productive. And there's a certain machine that does that. Does anybody want to guess what that is? It's the steam engine. Now, steam engine. Guys have heard of the steam engine, yes. Yeah. Okay. So the steam engine. What the steam engine does is it revolutionizes a couple of different things. On the one hand, we have what's called the transportation revolution. And what that means is that essentially the speed of the world increases from about 3, screaming 25 mph, right? And you're gonna say, well, 25 mph is not very fast, but you guys have been. Many of you have sat on the freeway, on a 405 freeway in LA, and you know that 25 miles an hour is fast, right? So. But the main thing, if you think about it in terms of numbers, right, I is that 25 mph is eight times, a little over eight times faster than 3 mph, which is the speed of the world before the transportation revolution. I'm talking about steam engines. I'm talking about steam trains and steam boats, right? Okay. And so if it's eight times faster, what that really does is it makes the world eight times smaller, doesn't it, that essentially the world is eight times smaller than it was before? Okay? And. And if you think about, for example, in terms of american history, many of you guys have heard of Lewis and Clark. Tell me about Lewis and Clark. They're. They. They actually went to the west coast, right? Yeah. Okay, yeah. The Lewis and Clark expedition, right? Yeah. Right. The Lewis and Clark expedition. They went from Pittsburgh to the west coast of the United States, and then they ended their expedition in Louisville, Kentucky. So how long did it take for them to go from Pittsburgh to the west coast and back to Louisville? It was 18 months. 18 months, right. Okay, so that was in 1803, and that was before the introduction of the steam engine. Okay, but if we go to 1865, there's the completion of the transcontinental railroad, and now it's possible to go from the east coast to the west coast in two weeks. You see what happens? And it's because of that that Americans were able to subdue the north american continent. If you think about when Jefferson bought Louisiana, he thought that it would take a thousand years to settle that territory, and yet the whole thing was settled within a century. Right? And it's because of the transportation revolution. So that has an enormous influence on world history, on american history. Okay?",122

","We'll remember that in the. The feudal system, we had the lords and the peasants, right? But in this. In this new industrial world, the. The people who are actually running things are not the lords, they are the merchants, right? And what do we call these merchants? Because they come from the city. We call them bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie. Bourgeoisie, exactly. And then, and then think about the people. One of the things you're going to need, you're going to need labor in these factories. And so people who have spent their lives on the fiefdom in the village or whatever, working in the fields, right? Because of the agricultural revolution, which we're going to talk about in a couple minutes, are no longer needed. So they're going to emigrate and they'll go into the cities, which is where the factories are, right? And they'll go. They'll go to work in the factories, okay? Now, but when they come to the factories, what do they bring with them? Do they have their own tools? They don't have anything, right? The only thing that they have is their labor, right? So what happens then is that these people, who we would call peasants, the peasants at least had their own tools, right? And so we can think of those tools as the means of production, right? So if I'm the peasant that makes sweaters, then my loom is the means of production, right? And if I own the loom, that means whatever surplus I can get from using the loom belongs to me. You got it? But in this situation, we have the bourgeoisie who owns the factory. He owns the means of production. But the worker who we're going to call, it's a brand new class, it's never existed before, called the proletariat. The proletariat will own only their labor. So the initial situation that's created by industrial capitalism is that the bourgeoisie owns the means of production and therefore gets the surplus from production. And the proletariat owns only their labor, and they receive a subsistence wage for their labor, okay? When I say subsistence, I mean just enough. So if it takes a nickel a day to live, you get a nickel. If you don't get to work, if you don't go to work, you don't get the nickel and you don't live. That's just the way it is, right? Okay, so it's not like, it's not like if you lived, if you were a worker, you could get minimum wage and you could get cable tv and a car or a bus pass or whatever. None of that stuff. You'd have nothing, essentially. Right. So. Or actually less than nothing sometimes. So the point here is that this ends up being a kind of an exploit. Not kind of. It was an extremely exploitating system. Right. But for now, and we'll talk again about that in a little while. And then next on Thursday. But I. For now, what we want to notice is that in this new manufacturing system, the factory system. We can create a large quantity of medium quality goods at a low price. So, remember, in the cottage industry. We created a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Here we create a large quantity because we can make them 24 hours a day. Medium quality. Because it's no longer made just for you. It's made in standard sizes. Right? So if we were to go to targets today and buy a shirt. You could either. You could either buy small, medium, large or extra large, right? And depending on. I mean, nobody fits exactly in those sizes. But it's close enough. That's the way we see it. Right? But anyway, the point is, it's medium quality. And because you make so many of them. And because the laborers are so available. They don't have to pay them anything. So basically you can buy these goods at a very low price. Okay? So now what I want to talk about is this process of proletarianization, right? Okay? So basically, I've already described this. Ownership of the means of production shifts to the factory owners, who we call the bourgeoisie. And because they own the means of production. They receive the surplus. Right? And then the proletariat. Who are going to be coming from the land, from the fiefdoms. Essentially they only own their labor. And so they receive a subsistence wage. So this creates a two class system. Essentially two classes, right. Of the people who are well to do. And the people who are poor. The working poor. Right? That's essentially what these two pictures show.",123

","All right, well, now let's move on to the issue of modernization. Okay, you guys have probably heard the term modernization, but I think it's probably a little different from what you are used to thinking about or the way you used to think about it. And so let's just go ahead and start with that. I'm going to define modernization as to look like the west. And what that means is that a country has an industrialized economy and a liberal government. All right, so industrialized, we just talked about what was an industrialized economy, and we're going to talk about in a few minutes why industrialization leads to democratization. But remember, we talked about earlier what we mean when we say liberty with an exclamation point. It's three different things. What are they like? Freedom to produce, freedom to make money. I remember. I don't remember exactly. Well, that's part of it. That's capitalism. Right. Capitalism was the third one. Laissez faire. Capitalism. Laissez faire. Right. So that was the third one. The first one, though, was what? One person, one vote. Democracy, sovereignty. Democracy. So democracy. And then there was one in the middle that had to do with religion. What was that? Secularism. Democracy. Secularism, capitalism. Don't forget. Right. Democracy, secularism, capitalism. Because all three of those things together are called liberalism. In order to be a modernized country, you have to have an industrial economy and a liberal government. Okay. There were instances of countries that had the industrial economy, but their government wasn't very liberal, but they were not very long lasting. Okay, well, let's think about what countries then would we say were modernized countries? Can you guess which countries in the world in, say, 18, 1800, which countries had industrial economies and liberal governments? The west. Right. Which one? So the West Europe countries. Europe. Okay. What part of Europe? It's actually not all of Europe, but you're right, it's western Europe. So we're talking about united States, Britain, France, Germany, Germany, Belgium, not Spain, not Italy, not Russia. Right. Just those. So we have England, France, Belgium, Germany, and that was it. Right. England, France, Belgium, Germany. United States is one of these modernized countries and modernizes in second half of the 19th century after the civil war. So modernization is going to be associated with Europe and the United States, western Europe and the United States. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, we talked about. We didn't talk about this much, but we'll talk about it now. And what happens is, and this actually goes all the way back to the discovery of America. When America was discovered, Europeans gained access to crops that made it possible for less people to feed more, to produce enough food to feed more people. Right. So, if you'll recall, I think. I'm pretty sure I mentioned to you that during the Middle Ages, the population of Europe was essentially stagnant, meaning that it was. It was. It stayed constant. Every now and then it would go through a growth spurt, but then there'd be a famine or a plague, and it would go back to somewhere around normal. So the population of Europe essentially was stagnant throughout the middle ages. But after the discovery of America, they discovered a staple crop that made it possible for less people to produce more food. Does anybody know what that crop was? Wheat. Corn. Wheat. Well, it was neither one, actually. The big one was they already had wheat. They didn't have corn, but that was something they would get. But the big one was potatoes. I know that sounds very unsexy, doesn't it? Right. But in reality, what happens was the introduction of the potato into Europe made it possible for the european population to start to grow. And it continued to grow from then all the way up until after world War two. And after world war two, it starts to decline. Okay. Like in the United States. But at any rate, the point here is that this making it possible for less people to produce more food disrupts the agrarian economy, because now people that had been necessary before to grow food so that everybody had enough are no longer needed. Right? So. So I don't know if you guys will remember or maybe have. Have watched or experienced the Christmas Carol by Dickens. Charles Dickens. Right. And one of. I'm sorry, I was just saying Dickens. One of the things that. Yeah, one of the things that. That Scrooge says in there is let them die and decrease the surplus population. What's he talking about when he says surplus population? He's talking about there's more people available to work than there is work for them to do. You get what I'm saying? This is one of the reasons why the factory owners were able to keep the wages so low is because if one person didn't work, the next person, they could get somebody else to do it. Right? Okay. So what then happens is that because they are no longer needed on the fiefs in the agrarian, in the fields, and also because the new owners of these fiefdoms, the bourgeoisie essentially are closing off fencing in the field so that the peasants can no longer work them, then they are going to move. And where are they going to move to? Well, they're going to move to the cities because that's where the factories are, and that's where they're going to be able to essentially try to find some work. And so they'll move, let's say, from somewhere in the middle of nowhere in England to Manchester, which is an industrial city. But once they get to Manchester, they realize that, but there's hardly any work there because there's so many workers. So they'll book passage on a ship to America. Right. They'll either go to the United States, might go to Mexico or Brazil, Argentina. Right. They'll go throughout the Americas. And what that will do then is lead to a massive movement of people from actually throughout the 19th century. Okay, so that's going to be something that accompanies, when I talked about the potato, that is going to be. What's the word I'm looking for? It's going to be supplemented or exacerbated by the fact that they introduced new technologies to agriculture, like rotating crops and things like that, so that they can make more food, but they don't need as many people to. To make it. Okay, so that's going to be then, essentially what we see then is that instead of the world or the western world, the industrial world being a world centered on villages, it becomes a world centered on urban areas, on cities, and we start to see huge cities grow. London, New York, Boston. Right. These are. These are ten times or more bigger than any of the biggest cities in the world during the Middle Ages. Right. In the 19th century. Okay, question. Comments about this. Not San Diego. San Diego is still a little baby in the 1850s.",124

","Let's think about this for a second. Capitalism leads to a wider distribution of wealth. Before, the only people that could be wealthy were the people who own the land. But now you don't need any land in order to create lots of wealth. So that means that more people can be wealthy, right? But now if more people can be wealthy, what does the golden rule tell us about political power? First off, what is the golden rule? Person that controls the wealth has the power. Right? Whoever has the gold makes the rules. Right? So that's not the one that you maybe learned in church, but this is the one that actually rules the world. Okay? The golden rule. Whoever has the gold makes the rules. Right? And because more people own the gold, more people are involved in making the rules. Right? So just think about in your own experience with us history. Who were the american revolutionaries? American revolutionaries were not nobles. They were property owners. Adams, Washington, Jefferson, right? And so they were the. They actually had wealth, okay? And because of that, they essentially set up a system where they rule. Okay? If you think about. I mean, you think about when the constitution was first in effect, most people were left out. Most people couldn't participate, right? It was only the wealthy. And we always say property owning white males. And we say that as if property owning white males is a bad thing to be. Yeah, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't know. But the main thing here is that it was only because property. Property owning white males were the only ones. Wait a minute. Property owning white males were the only ones who could hold wealth? Essentially. Right? And because of that, they end up being in control of everything. Okay. Questions? Comments about that. Okay, so then one of the things that happens. Okay, let's think about this. Remember we talked about the other day, laissez faire capitalism, right? We talked about how Adam Smith said that because the amount of wealth is unlimited, people should be allowed to use their own enlightened or should be able to pursue their own enlightened self interest, which means that people should be allowed to work to make as much money as they want and that the government should keep its hands off. That's what laissez faire means. Laissez faire means the government keeps its hands off of the economy and lets the economy run itself. The invisible hand, essentially, is what runs the economy. But the idea behind that is that everybody that can get wealthy will get wealthy. And those people who don't want to get wealthy or are not willing to put in the effort will not get wealthy. That's the way it's supposed to work. Okay. And in reality, what's supposed to happen with capitalism the way that Adam Smith imagined it was that there would not, there would not, it would not. Capitalism would not produce a two class system with a wide gap. Right? Like we see the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. And the reason why is because as soon as somebody started making lots of money, somebody else would come up with something a little bit better, and that would take away some of the first person's clout, I guess you could say, in the marketplace. And so because of competition, there would never emerge this class wage inequality, right? Income inequality. Okay. So what really happens, though, is that the wealthy people, rather than allowing the government to keep its hands off, essentially come to control the government, and they use the government to protect their own interests. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So it's supposed to be, the government's supposed to be completely hands off the economy. And if you ask any capitalist today, they'll say, oh, yeah, the government shouldn't have anything to do with the economy except that we want to make sure that they protect our interests. And our interests are, I'm going to make lots of money. So if I'm big pharma, I'm going to make sure that the government acts in a way that makes sure that my company, my industry makes lots of money. And if I'm in coal or fossil fuels, I'm going to do the same thing, whatever it is. So what ends up happening then is that rather than the government keeping its hands off this laissez faire, the government actually becomes the interest of the, of the bourgeoisie, the capitalist class, right? You guys follow me here. And again, I'm not a communist, but this is actually the way it works. Okay. You can look at it and see, okay, but now here's what's really interesting, is that people who are capitalists will say, well, the government shouldn't have anything to do with private industry, pretty much only when it comes to labor relations, because what they're saying is the government should never step in and advocate for the working class. Instead, the government's supposed to be on the side of the owners. You see what I'm saying? So that's that argument that you hear. You hear people who are conservatives and say, well, the government should keep its hands off, right? Well, yeah, if they want the government to keep its hands off, then stop. Stop having the government do your bidding, essentially, right? That makes sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? Okay, well, anyway, that's the reality of it. All right. I think it's funny that. I think it's funny talking about, like, laissez faire, like, hands off during, like, the whole coronavirus and everything. We're just, like, pumping like, trillions into the stock market or the economy to try to keep it alive so that it wouldn't go under. But that's the government getting involved in capitalism, basically, and other people when they should just leave their hands off. Well, yeah, I agree. The thing, though, is, and one of the things that we'll see as we go further into the course is that lithosphere capitalism is an unconscionably brutal system because it ends up with a very tiny group of people having enormous amounts of wealth and almost everybody else having nothing. Okay? That's the way you leave it right now. If you leave it unregulated, that's what it will happen. And so what happens in the 19th and 20th centuries is that different governments will intervene in different ways to regulate laissez faire capitalism. So in the United States, it was the progressives and it was the new deal, the great society. Maybe some of the stuff that Biden's trying to do now in England and other places in Europe, it's government ownership of industries so that industries aren't able to exploit the people. But the point is that all of these things are moves to mitigate laissez faire capitalism, because if you don't mitigate laissez faire capitalism, the big consequence of that more than likely would be revolution. Because when people are dying, they don't just lay down in the street and die. I. All right. Well, the one last thing that kind of comes from this, then, is going to be the rise of the middle class. All right. The middle class. Remember when we talked about the feudal system? There were lords and there were peasants, right? And then when we get into the industrial age, there are bourgeoisie and proletarians. Right? But I. One of the things that happens is that because of the complexity of machinery in the industrial era, it becomes necessary to educate workers. Workers end up going into work with more than just their labor. They go in there with knowledge, right. And that knowledge is something that they can bargain with. All right. I, and so what ends up being, what ends up happening is there's a new class that's created. It's a kind of a managerial class. People have to have to, somebody has to be there to manage the factory, to run. The factory owners can't do it anymore, and workers can't work right. Without somebody running the factory, essentially. And that's going to be the rise of the middle class. Okay? One of the things that you should, could think about, and this is actually what happened in the United States, is that when the middle class exercises its power, the middle class becomes the ruling class. Okay? So if we look at, for example, after the progressive era, the middle class essentially ran. They were the, the ruling class, I guess you could say same thing in a way after the new deal. And one of the ways you can know it is that people used to, people who were running for office used to try to convince everybody that they were just like you, the middle class. Right? But that's what it used to be like. How many of you guys have heard politicians lately say, oh, you should vote for me because I'm working at a McDonald's or something like that? Right? Nobody says that, okay? Except for AOC. He used to be a bartender. Right? But at any rate, the point here is that the middle class, if it exercises its power because of the golden rule, will be the ruling class. The problem is almost everywhere, and now, including the United States, the working class works against its own interests. It supports people who are against their interests. And that's something that's called false consciousness. We'll just leave that for now. Right. But at any rate, we could see it in the United States that the middle class was the robust ruling class in the middle of the 20th century. Okay, questions, comments about this? So that is one of the results then, of industrialization is this rise of democracy.",125

","Okay, one last thing. Imperialism. We talked about imperialism, and one of the things that you'll. That we have to note is that the rise of imperialism is motivated by industrialization. And what I mean by that is, for example, if we look at England, I told you about England before. The british empire was built on textiles. Cotton textiles, right? The problem is that in England they don't grow cotton, okay? So if you're going to make cotton textiles, you got to get cotton somewhere. And at first they got it from the american colonies, but after the civil war or during the civil war, they found that that source was not reliable, so they went elsewhere, and they got it from Egypt and eventually from India. Right? Okay, so now what's happening is that England is importing cotton from India. And we would think, okay, well, that sounds okay. I mean, if we're going to have a textile factory, then I'll find somebody that has cotton and I'll say, okay, you give me your cotton and I'll give you something in return. Some money or something like that, right? But because Europeans were advanced technologically over the rest of the world, the English were able to go to India and say, look, you guys have cotton and we have guns, so if you give us your cotton, we won't kill you. Right? And that's essentially what imperialism is. Imperialism is that the people of England are able to control the resources of India through military power. So imperialism essentially is a quest for resources and markets. England needed resources to make all these cotton textiles. And once they'd made all the cotton textiles, they had to have some place to sell them. Right? So they imported the cotton from India and then they sold the textiles back to India. Right? And India was there only to create wealth for the mother country. Right? You guys follow what I'm saying? Okay. Americans are going to do this as well, but Americans are going to do it in a slightly different way, because instead of ruling other countries, the United States will find other ways to control the economy of other countries. We'll talk more about that. I have a lecture in two weeks, I think, on industrialization. Anyway, the United States will be an imperial power, but it won't be like the european imperial powers or like Japan, because the United States doesn't need to go outside of the United States or outside of the north american continent to find resources and markets until much later. America has access to the west, which gives them access to all the materials that they need. And the population is growing, so they have plenty of markets. They don't really need to look overseas for an empire, because we have an empire right here now on our own continent. You guys follow what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. Okay. But now let's, that's the kind of economic aspect of imperialism. But there's another aspect of it as well, because what I'm doing is I'm going to your country, say, I'm going to your house, and I'm stealing your stuff. Right. And I have to somehow justify that. Okay? I have to be able to justify the fact that I walked into your living room and stole your couch. Okay? And the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to say, well, I could say it one way or the other. I could say, okay, you know, you weren't using the couch, right. Anyway, you were, like, drooling on it and stuff like that. So, so I'm going to take better care of the couch than you did. Right? So, so therefore I deserve the couch. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? Or I could say, well, you guys can keep the couch, but I need to show you how to use the couch. I. Correctly. Right. And that's going to be the western way of doing it. The western way. We're going to kind of summarize it in a, in a phrase that's the name of a poem by Rudyard Kipling called the white man's burden. Right. The white man's burden. And the idea behind that is that, is that the white Europeans are at the pinnacle of civilization. Why? Because they're white Europeans. Right. And everybody in the world that's not white is somehow not as advanced as the Europeans. Professor? Yes, my last professor described it as a, like, european exceptionalism, where they just view everything to do as just the pinnacle and they try to, like, essentially save everyone else. Well, that's, that's the, that's the ideal. That's also the ideal behind american mission and the idea of. The idea behind manifest destiny. Yeah. Right. The idea that the american way is the best way, and you better do it this way, and we're going to show you how to do it. Right. Okay. But now let's, let me go on a little bit further here. Right. So it has, it's kind of like we can think of all of the civilizations of the world as children in a family, right. And that, you know, when you say you're in a family, I don't know if you guys have brothers and sisters, right. But say if you're the older brother, right. And you have a younger brother, then you feel responsibility to help that younger brother to learn the ways of life. Right? Okay. And that's the way the Europeans will think about themselves. They'll say, okay, well, we have reached this pinnacle of civilization. Our mission is to help you guys along. The British called it the civilizing mission, right? To civilize people, which is ironic if you think about it, because the people of India were civilized centuries before the Europeans, right? The people of India already had a thriving civilization while the people of the British Isles were running around in the woods naked and painting themselves blue. Right? You follow what I'm saying? All right, so it's an ironic thing, and it's really not. It's not valid. It's not valid to say that there is some pinnacle of civilization that can be reached and that we're there and everybody else should be there with us. Right? But that's the driving motivation. So that will drive european, some european imperialism, also american imperialism. Americans go to places and they say, we're here to bring democracy. Why is the United States in Iraq? Because we brought democracy. Right. Why did the United States bomb Libya? Because of democracy. Right. You listen to any of the presidents, it could be George Bush, it could be american, it could be Barack Obama. But they both justify american military force by saying that we support democracy. Well, does America really support democracy? Yes, it does. Right? But America is selective about where it enforces it because they enforce it in Libya and Iraq, where there's oil, but they don't bother to enforce it in Rwanda. Right? There's a huge humanitarian crisis in Rwanda. The United States doesn't care a bit about that. You follow what I'm saying? So why do they care about Iraq but not Rwanda? You follow what I'm saying? That makes sense to you guys. Okay, so we'll just leave it at that and I'll get back and we'll talk more about that later. But the main thing is here is to make that link between. Let me just say one last thing and then I'm going to let you guys go. Right. Modernization is the dilemma of the 19th century because all the countries in the world can be divided between those that are modernized and those that are not. The modernized countries like Britain and France and Germany and the United States and Japan eventually are going to be modernized, meaning that they. Let me just say it this way, modernization, you should write this one down. Modernization means to look like the west. Okay, well, how does the west look? What does the west look like? You know, it's got a saguaro cactus and, you know, tumbleweeds and stuff. No, that's not it. Right? It's got it. It's got liberalism or liberty. Guys, remember we talked about liberty the other day with the exclamation point point, right? And it's also got industrialization. So to be a modernized country, you have to have liberalism and industrialization, right? And you'll see all of the industrial countries of the 19th century were both of those things, right? Other countries that are not modernized end up being essentially prey to. To the modernized countries, right? So the dilemma is modernize or be colonized, right? If you cannot modernize, you will become colonized. And where we can see this really starkly is in China. China at the beginning of the 19th century was the most powerful country on earth. Most powerful, the most prosperous, the most advanced country on earth, right? But because they believed that they were, had already achieved the pinnacle of civilization, they ignored the threat of the west. They said they thought of the west as a bunch of barbarians, and they didn't make any effort to modernize. In fact, they were against modernization. They said, why should we modernize? We're already. We're already the best, right? And the result was that by the beginning of the 20th century, they're so weak that they're what they call carved up like a melon, right? That China became so weak that the european powers essentially carved it up into spheres of influence. And the Americans were in on that as well, right? Okay, so. So that was China's lesson. Japan noticed that lesson. Japan noticed that China didn't modernize and became colonized. And their response was to deliberately modernize. So they went through this very painful modernization period called the Meiji revolution, right? And the outcome of it was that they became a modernized country. But ironically, when they became a modernized country, they also became an imperial power. They also became a colonizer. Why? Because they needed resources and markets, right? Okay, so the dilemma that we're looking at then in the 19th century is modernize or be colonized. China didn't modernize and they were colonized. Japan did modernize and they weren't colonized, but they became colonizers. Right? You guys follow? I'm saying. All right, so that's kind of the, the economic formula, I guess you could say, for the 19th century, for imperialism, and it's all driven by industry, all right, by the industrial revolution.",126

","This image right here is a pretty important image. Somebody's got chat. Okay? It's a pretty important image because what it is is a history of very, very bare bones history of England from the time of Henry VIII until the time of the institution of the constitutional monarchy. Right. And the reason why that's important is because that covers the entire colonial period in the United States or in North America. Okay? And so the reason why we need to have some background in this is because we need to be able to understand what's happening in England so that we can understand what's happening in North America. Okay? You guys are all with me. Questions, comments about this, okay? So now let's just dive in here, and we'll start with Henry VIII. Everybody's heard of Henry VIII. What do we know about Henry VIII? You separated the church, like, his church, straight from the Roman Catholic Church, and he basically created the anglican church, I believe. Well, it will eventually become the anglican church. Yeah, that's. That's the big thing that he does. But he's also well known for what, killing his wives? Well, he only killed two of the eight. I think it was six. Six or eight. I think it was six. He killed two of the six, but he didn't kill them all. But anyway, you're right. That was. That's the thing. And that's what most people know. Right? The reason why we know him. This actually is not true. This word says he died of syphilis. That's not true. Okay, so I have. I thought I fixed that, but it's. It's false. It's false news. Fake news. Right? Fake news. Don't. Don't pay attention to that. Right? That's actually. There is a. There was a rumor, and it goes around. Some people still believe it, but it's actually not true. I did some research on it. Right? But as I think it was, Vin talked about, the main thing he did was he started the english reformation. Well, what is that? The english reformation? If I. We've already talked about the reformation, right? What is the reformation? When the church began to reform, but it also allowed the splits of, like, multiple sects of the church. Right. Well, what. When we think about who started the reformation. Martin Luther. Martin Luther. And why did Martin Luther. Why did Martin Luther's idea of reformation cause the church to break? What was the conflict over? He was dissatisfied with the corruption within the church and just different ways to view religion. That's part of it. So it's really theory. It was really theological. It was a theological break. A theological disagreement. Right. They were disagreeing over theology. Okay? But when Henry broke away from the church, this is meant. This is a few years later. Right. 1517 was when Martin Luther posted his theses. And it's not until, I think, 1530 something when. When Henry breaks from the church. Right. And the reason why he did that wasn't because he disagreed with it theologically, because he was very much on board with catholic faith, but he had a disagreement with the pope. The pope. He had. He had married a woman. Her name was Catherine of Aragon. That's not her name. Her name was Catherine, and she was from Aragon. That's why they call her Catherine of Aragon. And Aragon is part of Spain, so it's part of the spanish kingdom. And Henry married Catherine of Aragon to cement a kind of an alliance between England and Spain. Okay. Between the royal houses. The problem was that Catherine was not able to produce a male heir. And then on top of that, Henry was infatuated with another woman named Anne Boleyn. Right. And he wanted to have relations with her, but she refused to do it unless he divorced Catherine and married him. Right. Well, divorce, as you guys may or may not know, is not something that can happen in the catholic church. Catholics have never acknowledged that you could be divorced, but they do allow for what's called annulment. And what would cause an annulment's like a divorce. Meaning that what it really means is that the marriage was never valid to begin with. Right. And so Henry tried to convince the pope that his marriage to Catherine was not. Was never consummated, and therefore it was not ever. It was never valid. Right. And Catherine opposed that. And the pope ended up siding with Catherine. And the reason why was because Catherine was the niece. Wait a minute. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the holy roman emperor. He was also Charles I, king of Spain. Same guy. Right. But because he was a holy roman emperor, the pope deferred to him, and that meant that he would not allow Henry to get an annulment. All right? So eventually what ends up happening is that Henry has parliament pass a law that makes him head of the church in England. And as head of the church in England, then he can ask for an annulment and he can grant it to himself. So he did. Right. So he. The whole thing was engineered to be able to annul his first marriage. The other thing was that once he became head of the church, he was also able to, because he. At that point, then he controlled all the monasteries. And so what he did was he sacked all the monasteries and took all their money. Right. Okay, so what we really see then is that Henry's reformation didn't have really anything to do with reforming the church. It had to do with money and politics. Right. You guys see me here? So when I say the english reformation, that's a very different thing than the reformation. You guys understand that? I know it's a little confusing because they use the same names for two different things. Right? But it is important to remember that. So if we say english reformation, we're not talking about a theological dispute. We're talking about politics and money. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right. Okay, so. So he breaks the church, then he ends up going, I'm sorry, did he end up marrying. Marrying this other woman? And she couldn't produce an heir as well, right? No, she was the mother of Elizabeth, which we'll talk about in a few minutes. Right. Actually, Catherine was the mother of Mary, and Anne Boleyn was the mother of Elizabeth. And then I don't remember who it was. One of the other. One of the other women had a son named Edward. And we'll talk about that in a second. Does that answer your question? All this european stuff is very confusing. You think american history is confusing? But anyway, so, at any rate, then he goes on, and as I mentioned, he marries five more times. He has two of his wives killed, and one of them dies in childbirth. I think there were two that survived him. One was Catherine of Aragon and also Anne of Cleves, who he was only married to for about a day. But anyway, the point here is that what that really does is it feeds into the conflict that's happening on the continent of Europe at this time. Let's think about now, the timeline. What is happening on the rest of Europe at the time. We're talking about what's happened in England right? Now. Remember, the reformation started in 1517, and the reformation resulted in. What is the wars in the church, wars of religion. And what were the wars about? About which religion was better, which religion was right. Okay, so in Europe, they're fighting over the Protestants fighting the Catholics, Catholics fighting the Protestants, Protestants fighting the Protestants. And in England, we see the same. Same divide. Now, we have. Most of the people in England are Catholic, and they want to be Catholic, right? But there are. But the king is now no longer Catholic, and he starts to introduce reforms that will turn England into more. Align it with Calvinism. Okay, which kind of keep. Just kind of keep in mind it's Protestantism. All right? And eventually, what's going to happen is that most of the people in England will. Will. Will want to. Will become protestant, and they will despise Catholicism. Right, that comes a little bit later, but. But it all has to do with this. This. This conflict over, you know, which is the right religion. Okay? So now, as I mentioned, Edward theoretically ruled, but he never really did rule because he was a boy and he died very young. And then Henry's first daughter, Mary, from Catherine of Aragon, who was a Catholic, comes to the throne, and she's very popular because she's Catholic, and most of the people are Catholic. And she says, we're going to go back to being catholic. But at the same time, there's a lot of people now who have decided they want to be protestant. And so Mary decides to solve the problem by what? What does she do with the Protestants? What do we drink on Sunday morning? Bloody Mary. Why do you think we call them Bloody Mary? This is Bloody Mary. Right, and why do we call her bloody? She has blood on her hands. Well, yeah, but what. Whose blood is it exactly? Anybody who would not return to the catholic church was killed, so that's why we call her Bloody Mary. Okay. She was still popular, though, and she. She didn't rule for a very long time because she was very sick. She thought she was pregnant, but in fact, she had a huge tumor in her abdomen, and she died from that. And then her half sister, Elizabeth, who was a Protestant, comes to the throne. All right, so Elizabeth is now the head of the church, and she says, okay, now we're all protestant again. Right? Okay, and. And. But unlike her sister or half sister, she doesn't force everybody to become protestant. What she does is she. She makes. If you're a Catholic, you can no longer participate in public life. Right? If you're not actually an Anglican, if you're not bound to the anglican church, of which she's the head, you're not able to participate in life. So the people who were not able to participate were dissenters. They were called dissenters, and they were also called, well, Catholics. So the dissenters and the Catholics were excluded from public life, which meant that they couldn't be lawyers, they couldn't be professors, they couldn't serve at court, they couldn't be judges, those sorts of things. They were kind of left out of society. Okay? And that was her idea of toleration. You could believe whatever you wanted to, but unless you believe what I want you to believe, you're outside of society. Another thing that happened during the time of Elizabeth was that the king of Spain, who was Carlos I, but then becomes Felipe the first. Felipe II, I think, Will. Will try to force England back into the catholic fold and send in a giant armada to try to conquer England. And that armada will be defeated by Sir Francis Drake, which really starts the decline of the spanish empire and the rise of the british empire. So the british empire will become the great empire of the world and will remain that until the middle of the 20th century. Elizabeth dies, there's no heir. So what. Another thing we should know, first off, one thing in the United States, one thing in America, it's named after Mary. Does anybody know what it is besides Bloody Mary's? Maryland. Maryland. Exactly. Okay. Because Maryland was founded by Catholics, which we'll see, and maybe next week. All right, Elizabeth was also named after something in America, or, excuse me, America. Something in America was named after Elizabeth, which was. Does anybody know what Elizabeth was called? What kind of queen? She was? The virgin queen. The virgin queen. Because she never got married. Right. So she's the virgin queen. So what do you think in America was named after her? Virginia. Virginia. Exactly. Okay. Although she probably wasn't a virgin, but anyway, because she had a. She had, like a consort. And that's this guy here, James the first. Right? He was just James of the house of Stuart before, but now he. When Elizabeth dies, James becomes the king. He's also the king of Scotland. Right. The thing about James was that he was very, very unpopular in Scotland because he was Catholic, and all the people in Scotland were staunchly presbyterian or calvinist. Right, reformist. Okay. And so he was very unpopular there, and he actually ends up being a pretty unpopular ruler. But because by now, much of England has decided they want to be Protestant, they don't really want to be Catholic. There are some still left, but most of them don't want to be Catholic. Right. And some of them really hate Catholics. Okay. So he ends up being king for quite some time. A couple things we know about him. The one thing we do know about him was that while he was king, he had the Bible translated into English, and that's where the King James Bible comes from, which I think, historically is very interesting because the King James Bible ends up being a very. Today, most people would think of it as a Protestant Bible, but it was actually commissioned by a Catholic. Right. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about this that also gives us an idea about the kind of language. If you've ever tried to read the King James Bible, you know that it's almost impossible to understand. Right. Because of the language. Okay? And that is one of the reasons why you had such a hard time understanding locked, because the language is very different. Okay. Okay. Now James dies and his brother. I think it's his brother. I don't know. I don't know the relations of all these guys. Anyway, Charles. Charles comes to the throne. He's also a Catholic, and he has a problem. The problem that he has is not necessarily that he's Catholic, although he's unpopular for that reason, but because he wants to use. He wants to send troops to the continent of Europe to fight, to restore Catholicism in these religious wars. All right? So basically, you think about it. Now, the people are on the side of the Protestants, but the king is on the side of the Catholics and he wants to send troops to help the Catholics. So think about that. Maybe in the United States, if there was a war between Canada and Mexico, and the president wanted Mexico to win, but people wanted Canada to win, and then the president sends troops to fight Canada, then people would be very upset. Isn't that right? And that's what happened here. Okay. One of the things that happens is that parliament becomes more powerful, and one of the, one of the kind of aspects of british law they have, what's called an unwritten constitution. Okay. I'm not going to go into it. I don't want to go into it in great detail, but one of the things that comes out of this unwritten constitution is the idea that the king can't raise taxes without the consent of parliament. Only certain taxes can he raise. Right? So there's kind of an idea that the king can raise taxes for emergencies, like if England was being invaded or something like that. But if he wants to raise taxes to build an army or something like that, he has to get parliament's commission. Right? And so what, Charles, when he first became king, was financing his armies with his own money, but he eventually ran out of money, at which point then he went to parliament and asked for money to support these armies that he made. And parliament essentially said, no, you can't have money for that. You can raise taxes, but you can't raise money for. You can't raise taxes for that. Okay. And then what happens is that the king goes ahead and raises taxes anyway, using what they call ship taxes or the emergency taxes, at which point then the parliament denounces the king and the king then tries to dissolve parliament. Right. He says, okay, you should just go away. Right. Because I don't have to listen to you anyway, because I got my right to rule from God. I don't get it from you. You get me here. So now, here's the other issue. Remember, the first issue we've been talking about is religion. The second issue we're talking about is where does the right to rule come from? And the king says his right to rule comes from God, but the parliament says, no, your right to rule comes from us. So then the real conflict is who really rules England? Is it the king or is it parliament? Right? And of course, the king says, it's me, and the parliament says, no, it's usually. And what ends up happening was that there was a civil war. The parliament went to war against the parliament, raised an army, went to war against the armies of the king. And eventually what ends up happening is that the king is defeated, captured, brought to trial before parliament and beheaded. Right? So I shouldn't laugh. It's not very funny. I'm sure he didn't think it was funny. But the point here, though, is that then England will become ruled by what's called a Commonwealth, which is in theory, a kind of a republic. But in reality, it turns out to be a kind of a religious dictatorship. Right. Where Cromwell, the leader Cromwell, tries to enforce puritanical religion on everybody in England. Right. Okay, so we're just going to leave it right there for now and we'll come back to it on a different day.",131

","Hello. We're going to talk today about the american expansion into the trans Mississippi west. We're going to focus some on the events that actually happened during that period of time, but we're going to mainly focus on an issue or a concept in historical. In the historical profession called historiography. H I s t o r I o g r a ph y. Historiography. And that is essentially the history of history. It is a story. It is the history of how the narrative has been told over time. And what we're going to look at today is how Americans saw expansion into the west during the 19th century and in how that perception of it changed in, in the 20th century. Now, the thing about the west is there's a certain subset or a certain set of things that happened between the period, say, around 1850 and 1900, that involved the settlement of the west. And most of it was actually, you know, pretty mundane, as we'll kind of discover here in a minute. But it was mythologized by Americans. Americans saw the conquest of the west as the playing out of the american mission to spread its ideals and its ideology and its civilization across the continent, a kind of a fulfillment of the idea of manifest destiny. And so the theme of the American west is mythologized in literature and in the, you know, performing acts, performing troops like Buffalo Bill's Wild. Buffalo Bill, Wild west or Buffalo Bill's Wild west show. And in movies. I mean, you guys probably have seen tons of the movies about the west, and, you know, they were even more prevalent when I was younger. And so what happens is that we developed this myth about what happened in the west. And because it's been so mythologized, it's hard for us to really take a clear eyed look at what actually happened. The thing that, and that's what we're going to be really addressing in today's lecture. But what really ends up happening is that the west comes to symbolize the United States, both for Americans and for foreigners. Right? So if you want to think about what is the quintessential image of the United States, it's the cowboy. And I'm going to show you that in a second here. The thing that we need to start off by saying is that the cowboy is not this heroic, liberty loving, nature, nature loving knight of the plains. It's actually, being a cowboy was actually meant to herd cattle across the. Across the countryside. And that was a very difficult job. It was something that was performed by young guys, and it was really kind of menial manual labor. So it's a lot like, you know, mythologizing, if we were today mythologizing construction workers or truck drivers. It's not that those are not honorable professions. It is that we don't really think of construction workers as being representative of our ideal and our ethos. Let's take a look then at a representation of the cowboy. And I got this actually from the LA Times quite some time ago. And obviously the date in this was in 2003. And it just occurred to me recently that this is probably really dated for you guys because it's talking about it was during the time of the United States contemplating the invasion of Iraq. And the Americans were pushing very hard for an invasion, and our allies in Europe were pushing back on it, so much so that the French were vocally against american intervention or anybody's intervention in Iraq. And the United States, people in the United States were offended by that. So that for some period of time, we had freedom fries instead of french fries. But at any rate, so this is part of that debate that comes out of the LA times at that period of time. And what we can see here is really two mirrors. And the mirrors, on the one hand, how do Americans see Americans? And that you see that there's the cowboy with, he's clean cut, he's wearing a star, he's got a white hat. He is the representation of the good guy. And then on the other hand, the way the Europeans see Americans is this slovenly, dirty, smoking bandit waving his guns around and standing in a pool of blood and wearing a black hat. So what we see then is that both Americans and Europeans think of Americans as cowboys. But a cowboy can be defined in two different ways, either as a hero or as a villain. And then in the middle of the picture, you can see George Bush, who was president at the time, you know, trying to make this decision or pushing this idea of invading Iraq. The main thing to take away from this is that, is that the cowboy essentially becomes the representation of the United States both for Americans and for foreigners.",131

","Okay, well, why did I just go through all this? Well, because I, you know, I love to tell the story, but also because that tells us why Locke wrote what he wrote when he wrote it. Because when did Locke write the second treatise on civil government? Where was that in this timeline? 610 19, 1680, 916. 89. Right. And what is the main subject of his treatise? It was to refute the right, the divine right of kings, in particular for the first treatise on another man's, I think, Robert Fillmore. It was to refute Robert Fillmore's patriarcha, which argued about the divine right of kings. Right. So here's the thing. That being true, the basic, if we want to look at it the most fundamental way, what he's really writing about is who rules England. Right? Remember, the question is, the big question is, who rules England? Is it the king or is it parliament? And what does Locke say? The people. The people. We'll talk about which people here in a minute. Right. But the people, he says parliament rules or the people's representatives rule. Again, we'll talk about that in a second. Okay. But the main thing here is he's making a statement in the middle of this conflict. Right. It's kind of like if you go back to, if you think about civilized politics, like we used to have in the United States, right. And you had the Democrats, who were in favor of raising taxes and doing things for other people, and the Republicans who are in favor of lowering taxes and letting people do things on their own. Right? That was the argument. Okay. And we could say, okay, well, if Locke was a Republican, he'd be writing a document saying, this is the reason why we shouldn't raise taxes, and this is the reason why people should be on their own. Right. And here we have Locke. The argument is, who rules England? And Locke, being on the side of the people, say that it's parliament, will say, no, the people should rule. That's why he's writing this. You guys get this. Okay. Why do you think it's important for us to understand that? Because is there roots of what we're getting now? Well, it's at the roots of us talking about this argument. It's also at the roots of the ideology that will found the United States. But also, think about if you were going to use this book as a historical source, what would you be able to write about? Would you be able to write about the attack on Pearl harbor? It's kind of the start of people being able to have a different perspective on government. Okay. You could do that. You could say this is an example of enlightenment thinking. Okay? You could write it, you could write about that. Or you could also write about, this is an example of, you know, the importance of property. Could you use it as, as you, could you use this as your only source in writing about England in the 17th century? No, not really. Right. So the reason why I'm asking this question is because when we look at a document like this, it will tell us certain things, but there's other things it won't tell us, right? And we need to know as historians, we need to identify what can we learn from this, right? And if we want to know about that, then that's great. We could use this source. But if we don't want to know about that, then we have to find a different source. You guys get what I'm saying here? This is part of, this is part of my crash course in making you all into historians by the end of this course. Let me just talk about this. Adam's private dominion, paternal jurisdiction. What is that all about? Why is that there? It's specifically to refute the first treatise which describes about the divine right of kings. Locke believed that all men were born equally and that Adam basically was the only one that was given dominion over all of like all of mankind and the beasts. And like his firstborn, which was you like, because back in the time, firstborns usually had. Right of, uh, what do you call it? Uh, right of, uh, or birthrights. And his line of, uh, his first line, uh, which is the line of Cain, could still not be found to this day. So it's near impossible. Therefore, no man has dominion over another. Okay, that's, that's pretty, pretty much right. There's, there's. Let me just kind of add a little bit to that. Right? We say adam's private dominion. If you think about Adam's private dominion, first of all, adam, first man in the bible, right? And you have to keep in mind that many people at that time believed that was the actual history of the world, right? So just kind of keep it right there. And so if the bible says adam is the first man, then everybody believes that adam's the first man. Okay? And it could have happened, you know, some time ago, 3000, 4000 years, whatever, right? But at any rate, the point here is that he's the first man and he has a dominion. Dominion means rule over what? Over everything, right? Now, what vin was talking about, where the first son inherits, that's actually not true biblically. Okay. Because that's called primogeniture. You might want to write this down. Primo. G e n I t u r e. Primogeniture. Right. And the. And what it means is the first son inherits everything. Okay? That is a european idea. It's a monarchical idea that developed in Europe, but it's not a biblical idea, because in the bible, the first son of Adam was killed. Okay, so then that would mean that even if his dominion was passed on, it wouldn't be passed on to the first son. It would be passed on to the second son, which was Cain. Right? Or maybe one of the other ones. Okay, but anyway, the point here is that Adam's private dominion was the world. Paternal jurisdiction means that he has the right to hand it on. Okay, what filmer and those guys were arguing was that if Adam ruled the world and he had the right to pass it on to his heirs. And what Locke is arguing is that, well, he may have had the right to rule the world, but he didn't have the right to pass it on to his heirs. Right. He didn't have paternal jurisdiction. Okay, we just leave it right there. Does that sound. That sound better? Vinyl? Yeah. Minor correction. So Adam. Adam's first son was the one that killed his younger son or his second son. He had a third, after, which inherited his stuff. Okay, you might be right about that. Did you notice how that difficult that was to come out? I had to admit that I was wrong. All right, I'm sorry, but you're right. Okay? But at any rate, if you look in the Bible, you'll see that the kingship is not inherited necessarily by the first son. It's inherited by many different reasons. Right? Okay, so anyway, let's move on. So the question then becomes, and this is in the very first chapter, the question becomes, well, if the king doesn't derive his right to rule from God, where does he derive this right to rule from? Okay, and so that's where we start with the state of nature. Now, what is the state of nature? The state of nature is where everyone is free to do whatever they want. Right? Everybody's free to do what they want. Okay, what is the restrictions? What are the restrictions on the state of nature? That you cannot hurt others. Okay. But other than that, what kind of liberty do you have in the state of nature? It's basically just you're free to do what you want as long as you respect others and treat others the way you want to be treated. Right? So you have perfect liberty. Right? So now let's think about this for a second. If you have perfect liberty. Right? Does that mean that I can tell you to read six chapters of John Locke and come to here and discuss it? No. No. In fact, nobody can tell you to do anything because you have perfect liberty. Right. And me telling you to do something would be infringing on that liberty. Right. So you're basically. The way it would work would be, you know, you wake up in the morning and, you know, you go get something to eat, and then you go surfing, and then you take a nap, whatever. It sounds pretty cool, right? You don't have to do anything. Anybody comes along, tells you to do something, you just tell them stuff. It. It's not. I don't have to do anything. Right. And nobody can. Nobody can refute that. Okay? So that's the state of nature. The state of nature is a state of perfect liberty. Okay, guys, you're with me. But there is a restriction. Somebody told me what the restriction was. What was it? The restriction is otherwise known as the law of reason, where no one man should harm another's life, liberty, and or property. Exactly. No man should harm another's life or property. And if you look in. I wish I had my. My document, because I could. I could read it to you. Exactly. But it says, this is the law. Which anybody knows this and what affirms this law. We know this is the law because what? Because of. Vin, you said it. Because of the law of reason. Reason. Because of reason. Now, you guys may have just read right through that, right? But the reality is that this is very. This is revolutionary for the time. Because if we want to know something is true, how do we know it's true in the 17th century? The Bible. The Bible. Exactly. We know what's true because of what the Bible says is true. But this isn't saying that. This isn't saying anything about the Bible in terms of its basis for truth, right? Instead, it's saying, we already know this is true. And how do we know it? Because it's here in our noodles, right? You guys got that? Questions, comments about this? Okay, so this is why this is starting. This is called the age of reason. It's not the age of. Let's figure out what the Bible says. Okay? You guys got it? All right, so state of nature is the state where you can do anything you want, perfect liberty. But you can't harm anybody else. You can't take away anybody else's liberty, essentially. And we know that because of reason. All right? You guys got that? Now, what happens if somebody does violate somebody else's liberty. What do we call that? We call that the state of war. State of war. Exactly. Now, this is important. Think about this now. All right? So the state of war is where, let's say you got a dog on your bed there, right? What kind of dog is that? He's a long haired dogs and conker spaniel. Okay, what's his name? Tucker. Tucker. Okay, so here's what happens. Kelly owns Tucker, but I decide to go and grab Tucker and keep him for myself. Right? Did that violate Kelly's liberty? Absolutely. So by doing that, what have I done? I have placed myself in a state of war with Kelly. Right? Now, what recourse does Kelly have to. To defend herself and her dog from me? She can kill you. Really? If I. If I stole your dog, you could come and kill me. Oh, you mean. Do you mean now? I'm saying now, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, she. She'd call the police and online police. Right. Okay, but in the state of nature, is there any police? Yes. Yes. Well, I read. Maybe I forgot, maybe I'm recalling wrong, but it said that people, all people can be. It was like enforcers of the state of nature. Exactly. Essentially what it means is that the only recourse that Kelly has in the state of nature is we're not in the state of nature, obviously. But if we were in a state of nature, the only recourse that Kelly has is her own ability to create force and violence. Right? So if I took her dog or if I attacked her, the only way she would have to defend herself is by whatever force and violence she could muster on her own. You guys get what I'm saying? That's actually the problem with the state of perfect liberty. State of perfect liberty is, yeah, you have all this freedom, but anybody can take it away from you if they're stronger than you are. You guys got it? Questions? Comments about that? Okay, so state of war, then, is when I put myself into, I violate somebody else's liberty. Right? And what is the outcome of the state of war? Let me just tell you straight up. The outcome of the state of war is always going to be death. Either Kelly is going to die, or I'm going to die, or both of us are going to die. And that's how the war ends. So just like in Romeo and Juliet, you and I are you or I are both must die. Right? That's the state of. That's a state of war. Okay, now, I know that's not true now, okay? Although it kind of is, in a way. But let's just say that this is the major point that I'm going for. Right? Okay? So now I'm going to take a little bit of a detour here and talk about slavery, because Locke talks about slavery, okay? And basically, up until this time, the way that we knew or the way that we justified slavery was by inferiority, that superior people had a right to enslave inferior people. Right? And then you can. You can define inferior any way you want to, and that gives you the right to enslave them. Right? Okay, so. So. But Locke says, no, that's not right. What happens is that somebody who becomes a slave is somebody who has lost a war, right? Well, what is the outcome of war? Death. Death, right. So that means then that a slave, if they've lost the war, they're dead. Even if they're still moving around, their bones are still moving around. They have lost their personhood by losing the war. And so they can be kept alive as slaves as long as they do the work for the master. Right? But if they don't do the work, then Locke said, you just kill them because they're already dead anyway. Right? You guys get what I'm saying here? It's a kind of a nasty concept, right? But it's very different from the other concept of inferior. Superior and inferior. Right. Why do you think that Locke comes up with a different justification for slavery? Because he says. Does he say that there's superior and inferior people? No. No. He says all men are created equal, equally equal. Right. So therefore there couldn't be anybody inferior. The slave is equal, born equal to everybody else. Right. But it also tells us that everybody can't. All people are created equal in the state of nature, but not everybody will remain equal. Okay? So let's move on. If you have any trouble with this, just let me know. All right, so let's move on. This is the big issue right here. Property. Right. What is property? Property is anything you put the work into producing. Okay, so basically, anything that I expend labor in obtaining is my property, right? Yes. Okay. Well, then when I stole Kelly's dog, it was mine. Because it took some labor for me to take her dog. No, because it was her property to begin with. Exactly. So when I. To create property, it has to be unowned. Right. It has to be in the state of nature. You have to take it out of the state of nature. Right. So what happened? What? He uses the example of an apple tree and an apple, right? If I go to the tree is in the state of nature. The apple on the tree belongs to who? To everybody. Everybody or nobody. Right. But then I expend my labor by picking that apple off the tree. Now, that apple belongs to who? To you. To me. Right. And what can I do with this apple? Whatever you want with it. I can do pretty much anything I want with it. What can you do with it? Absolutely nothing. Nothing. You can't touch it because it's my property. And you will notice that in this chapter six, I think it is, he says that if you came and take my apple or if I come and take your dog, you could kill me, because taking my apple or me taking your dog, if I could do that, I could also take your wife. Right? So essentially, he equates property with liberty. If I violate. If I take away your property, it's the same thing as taking away your liberty. You guys get what I'm saying? All right, so keep that in mind, because when we think about liberty, we don't think about that, do we? We think about, okay, I can wear the US flag as underwear and, you know, raise my fist on the street corner, and nobody can do anything about it. Right? That's liberty. Okay? But not for them. Liberty is property. Liberty is what you own, essentially. Right. Including yourself. Okay, so now, when we said I could do anything with my property, or when Vin told me I could do anything with my apple, right? Is there no limit on that? Is there any limit on the amount of property that I can own? Well, yes, physical property. So what happens is you should only take what all that you need in order to. For land, at least, and stuff related to, like, of nature. But that's where money comes in, right? So you. You can only use. You. You can only keep what you can use, essentially. Right? But here's the thing. And going along with what was what we just said, right? Let's say that I'm in 17th century England, and Locke writes, in the beginning, all the world was America. What does that mean? What does he mean by all the world was America? What was America? America at that time was currently open, vast, free. There were a lot of land, but right now, in England, it's the opposite, because there's so many people clumped up in that single spot, but there's not enough land or, like, stuff to dictate. Guess what? So America is the state of nature, right? And that was one of the draws of America, was people could go to America and gain wealth, okay? And so let's say that I'm a. I'm a immigrant, or an immigrant from England to America. Right? And I go into America and I find an apple orchard, right? And I want that apple orchard. How could I make that apple orchard mine? This is how the English did it. They built a fence around it. If they built a fence around it, that was the same thing as mixing your labor with it, so therefore it was yours. So I could go to America, I could build a fence around this apple orchard, and now the apple orchard is mine, right? So then fall comes, and I go out and pick all the apples, and I put them all in my barn. Then what's going to happen? Can I. Can I. Can I keep those apples? What's going to happen to the apples? They're going to rot. I can't eat all those apples, so they're going to rot, right? So what I have to do is I have to take that product that is perishable and exchange it for something which is imperishable. Which is what? Gold and silver. Money. Yeah. Rocks and paper, right? Okay, so I can sell you my apples, and then I can get rocks and paper in return. Right? And do these rocks and paper rot? No. So that means I can still use them. Right? And that's how I can gain lots of wealth. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying here? Questions, comments about that? Okay, now, here's the problem. Going back to the problem with living in a state of nature is what you have perfect liberty, but a little protection from other. Protection. No protection. Exactly. So let's say now I'm this guy that I talked about, and I went to America, and I built a fence around an apple orchard, and I've been harvesting apples for 40 years, right? And I've been collecting, turning it them into cash. So I've got lots and lots of money stashed on my apple orchard farm, right? And now there's 26 of you who come to America, and you don't have any property at all, right? And you decide they look, you look and say, look at that old guy over there. He's got all this property, he's got all this cash, and he's got nobody to help him protect it. So why don't we just go take it from him? So let's say now you're in your twenties and I'm in my sixties, and there's 22 of you and there's one of me. How am I going to protect my property? I'm going to lose it quite quickly, right? Okay. And so this is where we come into the creation of a political society, all right? Because what happens is I will realize how. How uncertain my property is and I will decide to make a deal with all the other property owners that are around me and I'll say, okay, look, you guys, we all own property, but none of us have any way to protect it. And so what we're going to do is we're going to say, if anybody invades my property, then you come to help me. And if anybody invades your property, then I'll come to help you. Right. And by doing that, what we're actually doing is giving up some of our liberty in exchange for protection. Does that make sense? Right. I have to give up some of my. I have to. To give up the right to sit it out when you guys are being attacked. When somebody's being attacked in order for them to not sit it out when I'm being attacked. So I give up some of my liberties, but I gain protection. Or I should say it this way, I give up some of my liberty to protect all of my liberty. Does that make sense, you guys? Okay, so not saying we're a bunch of old guys, we're still a bunch of old guys no matter what, right. So what happens is after a while, you decide that rather than us being the ones that go without and protects our property, we'll hire somebody to do it for us. And so we create a legislative and an executive. Right. The executive is in charge of the legislative, but the purpose of it is to protect our property. Okay, so how do we give consent to the legislature and the executive to protect our property? We have to give up some kind of liberty. What is it? We give up liberty in the form of taxes. Taxes. Exactly. So basically what ends up happening is we pay taxes to a government that protects our property. That means then that the government is created by who? The people. The people? Yeah. Which people? Laborers? No, not labor. Society. No, the people who agree to give up their liberties. Right, but what do they have to give up? Their liberties? They have to have something to begin with. Right. People got the money. People with property. Exactly. So the government is created by people with property and supported by people with property to serve people with property. Right. And that's why we can say everybody's born equal in the state of nature. But not everybody is equal, because some people have property and others don't. Right. And the people who have property are the ones who should be ruling the government or should be telling the government what to do. And everybody that doesn't have property should just shut up. See what I'm saying? And that means when the United States is founded as a democracy, it's not very much of a democracy, because only the people with property could vote, and you had to have a certain amount of property before you could vote. What happens next is that we realize, and Locke says this like ten times, the purpose of government is to what? Protect property, right? The purpose of government is to protect property. So if the government doesn't protect your property and instead of protecting your property, they take your property away without your consent, then they have done what they have placed themselves in a what? State of war. State of war with the people. And so the recourse of the people now, because the government no longer exists, is what? Violence? Well, it's to get rid of the government, right? We'll say this government is not doing what it's supposed to be doing. Instead it's. It's, instead of protecting us, it's attacking us. So we're going to get rid of the government. Remember, the state of war always ends in what? Death, right? So it's either going to be death of the government or death of the people, right? You guys get what I'm saying? And this is exactly what happens with the american revolution, right? The king parliament was taking money away from the Americans without their representation, without their consent. And Americans said, no, you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing. We're going to form our own government again. We're going to go through all this as we go on. But that is essentially the reason why. The couple things that we take from reading Locke, one is the importance of property in our system, right? Our system essentially is set up to protect property. And then later on, rights come more and more into it. But property is always going to be very important, right? And then secondly, this is the basis for our, the basis for the justification for our revolution. Now, we're not completely under Locke's ideas right? Now, because over time, a lot of this has changed and we'll see how that happens. But this is the beginning of it. This is where it comes from.",132

","We're going to shift gears here a little bit, and we're going to talk about the first, or I would say, yeah, it's really the first, but also the prototypical description of how the west was settled. It was a thesis written by a man named Frederick Jackson Turner, who was a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin. Was, he's very important in american, in the american historical profession because he was really the one who kind of established the tenets of professional historians in the United States. But he's most famous for a writing a thesis that he wrote which was called the importance of the frontier, the significance of the frontier in american history. It was published in 1893. Okay. And what he is responding to is a report from the Census Bureau that the frontier is closed. Okay, so now what do we mean by that? Let's take a look here at a map. And what we can see is when you, when you take the census, the census is done every ten years. It's in the constitution. And the purpose of the census is to discover where everybody in the United States lives. And that means everybody. And, and the purpose of that is to decide representation, because there's only so many representatives, and those representatives have to be divided up among the whole population. So every ten years, there's a count that's made to decide who gets what representatives. Like, for example, last year we did the census, and what we're, we don't know this yet, but what we probably are going to see is that California lost population and Texas gained population. And that means possibly that California will lose representatives and Texas will gain representatives. That's the whole purpose of doing the census. So when they do the census, then they count all the people. But they'll also have to graphically visualize where the people live. And so if you, for example, look at this green area, say we start in 1870. There's a census in 1870, and the green area is the area that's settled enough so that you can say this is a settled area and then everything else is not settled. Okay? So that's what we would call the frontier. All right? And what you can see then is that when they take the census ten years later, the frontier is smaller, it's shrunk. Okay? In 1880, all these areas now that are orange have been settled. And so the frontier itself is smaller. And then by 1890, we can see that it's expand the frontier, or the settled area has expanded even further. And it's going to be this expansion counted in the 1890 census that will cause the Census Bureau to conclude that the frontier is closed. And that's what we see here in this statement. Up to and including 1880, country had a frontier settlement. But at present, the unsettled area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line in the discussion of its extent and its westward movement. It cannot therefore any longer have a place in the census reports. And this is what motivated Frederick Jackson Turner to consider the significance of the frontier in american history. Because what Frederick Jackson Turner is going to propose is that the character of the United States that comes to be represented in the cowboy comes from the frontier. And what I mean by that is that the frontier creates conditions where, where people must develop the ideals and the characteristics that Americans value, like individualism and rugged individualism and love of nature and the idea of expansion, these sorts of things are the result of creating a civilization in a place where there is no civilization. And so the way that he imagines it is if we look at this map here, and we'll go all the way back to the beginning, the first colonies. There were colonies in Virginia and in New England. And what the people that came, according to Turner, what the people that came to America from Europe were doing was fleeing european civilization. That Frederick Jackson Turner will conclude that european civilization is decadent, that it creates oppression, it creates ill health, low infant mortality or high infant mortality rate, those sorts of things. And so when people come to America, they're trying to get away from that. And so they move then from a place where there is no civilization, from a place where that is civilized to a place where there is no civilization. And that means that they have to create a new civilization in a place where there is none. And that's going to be, it's going to be by that process that the american character will be developed, all right? And so then what we see happening is that all of the decadence of european civilization gets left behind in America, because America is creating a new civilization out of a frontier. The problem is that as the, as the civilization in America spreads, it too becomes decadent. And so what happens is that where we had this ideal civilization at one point, as it becomes more and more civilized, it becomes more and more decadent, like Europe. And that means then that what the people had escaped, actually, they recreated. But the saving grace for America is that there's always a new frontier. So when people, when the west, the East becomes too decadent, then people can move into the west, further into the west, and that create a new frontier, create a new civilization. And this keeps the american character alive. And they keep doing that. They keep moving further and further west as long as they can. But in 1890, the frontier is closed. That means that there's no more frontier on the american continent to conquer, which means that the american character is threatened, is challenged, right? Because it has been the frontier that kept the american character alive. But now the frontier, that character is being challenged because there's no longer any frontier. And then there's this danger that the United States will become decadent, like Europe. Okay? Frederick Jackson Turner writes this thesis, the significance of the frontier in american history. And what we can see here is some of his writing. And really, it describes how the frontier creates the american character. It describes the fact that there always has been a West that could be moved into. And that west causes the reenactment of the civilizing process, where you go from savagery to the trader, the pathfinder, and then ranch life and farmers, and then denser farmers settling in manufacturing and the factory system. So that's the progress of civilization. And keep in mind that at this time in the west, really in the industrializing countries like the United States, there was a sense that this was the natural order, the natural progress of civilization, that you would go from. That you would go from savagery to. To this pinnacle of civilization, which was a manufacturing society. Okay? And then also keep in mind as what we saw, what we talked about Monday. I guess, whenever we talked about industrialization, that meant that people who had developed manufacturing societies looked at countries that had not developed those kinds of societies as being backwards. And that leads to what we call the civilizing mission of the british or american manifest destiny. But at any rate, what he says then is that it was this creation, this progress of civilization, that creates the striking characteristics of the american. Okay, and then he describes it here. Okay, and then. And then he finally. He finally summarizes or concludes that because the frontier is gone, the first period of american history is over. All right? And that doesn't mean that the United States is over. What it means is that the United States will have to turn somewhere else for its frontier. And that's when it's historically accurate to say that after 1890, after the frontier in America was closed, we start to see american foreign intervention in overseas places, in Asia, and particularly in Latin America. So the idea then of the expansion, imperial expansion, which we saw on the north american continent now will spread elsewhere in the world. At the same time, the United States will become. Come to think of the frontier as being something less tangible, something like maybe a scientific frontier or a literary frontier. And finally, obviously, in the 1960s, we come to the final frontier, space. Okay? So the idea then is that the frontier, even though the actual physical frontier is closed, there is still this idea of the frontier which is fundamental to the american character. All right? Now what we want to do is we want to think about when Frederick Jackson Turner describes this movement into the west, is he thinking about something that's good or not? And it may seem that because it comes to an end, that it's not such a good thing. But what he's describing, remember, is this civilizing process. And from the point of view of people who lived at that time, Americans, the civilizing process was the natural order of things. So it was a good thing. Right? And we've already seen this painting, but we'll take a look again here. This is american what progress. Right? Excuse me. And what it shows is the american way, american civilization expanding from the east to the west. You can see the east is all clean and light, which is interesting because, as we know, industry creates a lot of really nasty environmental consequences. But from the point of view of the people that lived at the time, manufacturing was like Star Trek is to us. It was all clean and technological and good. Right? And then what we see is that we're taking this enlightened civilization into the dark west. Okay? So when we go into the dark west, we see whatever is living there, the animals and the. And the natives are fleeing before american progress. And that's a good thing. They need to somehow either be subdued or disappear, because the natural order of things is that they will be replaced by the american civilization here. Okay? So when we think about Frederick Jackson Turner's underlying idea of the settlement of the west, we have to acknowledge that that idea is one of the advancement of enlightenment. Okay? And that would be something that we would consider a good thing. Okay. This idea that Turner had, we can describe with a word, the word is ontology. O n t o s l o g y. Ontology. And this is a difficult word, and it's kind of a difficult concept, but it's something that's fundamental to historical. To the historical profession, because what is ontological is what we know to be true without even knowing that we know it. I know that sounds weird, but. But what it's. It's like. It's like the underlying foundation of knowledge. It's something that is. Is. It kind of arises from the culture, and it. It sets the standard for what can be considered true and what is not true. All right? So. Or can't be true. And. And, um, the, uh. For example, in the time that Turner wrote, what was ontological to the people of the United States was that the american expansion into the west was a heroic project, something that. That was. That, uh, that was expanding, uh, the american way. And that was a good thing. Right? And that was what everybody believed. And it really goes along with this sense that we talked about last week, the american sense of mission. The mission of the United States to spread liberty with an exclamation point. The idea that the United States is at the forefront of civilization. And this is something that Americans will internalize and believe, really, all the way up until probably the last half of the 20th century. Right? So this is with this in mind, this idea that pretty much everybody knows that what's happening, that's really the description of what's ontological, is everybody knows that. So how do you know something is true? Well, everybody knows that that's what's ontological. Right? And some people would call it common sense. In fact, there was a book written during the American Revolution called Common Sense, or before the American Revolution. And that was a book that was written to challenge what was ontological at the time. Right. What was ontological at the time was that to, in order to rule a large country, you needed to have a monarch. And Thomas Paine wrote this book, common sense, saying, no, that's ridiculous. You don't need a monarch, that people can rule themselves. Okay? And that was a challenge to what was ontological at the time. All right? But what we see here with Turner is not a challenge to what's ontological, but a kind of a endorsement of it.",132

","Now, let's think about the history of the United States from the time that Frederick Jackson Turner wrote until, say, today or the last part of the 20th century. And what we'll notice is that this sense of mission that drove the Americans really was with Americans all the way up until the time or during World War two. And World War two seemed to be the fulfillment of the american mission, because the Americans came to the rescue of democracy and liberty throughout the world and emerged from world War two as the most powerful and most prosperous nation on earth. And so it seemed there for a moment that the United States said had really reached the pinnacle of what it, of its sense of its own sense of mission. But World War two also opened up a lot of old wounds in american society that will challenge american society from then, really, for the rest of the century. And among those are going to be civil rights and, and gender rights and things like that. That will come up. And also the United States takes, it abandons its, since its policy of isolationism and takes on a leading role in the world as the world's really the first, what we call superpower, and will enter into a long conflict with the Soviet Union in what's called the Cold War. And as part of that cold War, the United States. Well, I should say it this way, the United States sees itself in the cold War as the defender of liberty, as the defender of democracy. And that goes along with the american sense of mission, that the american sense of mission is not only to spread democracy, but to, but to defend it. And communism, from the point of view of Americans, is not democratic. So it's actually antithetical, and it is actually theoretically as well as practically. All right, so then the United States then engages in the world in different places. The United States engages in Korea, for example, because the soviet backed North Koreans invade South Korea, who was an ally of the United States. And that was kind of an extension of the Cold War. All right. Or. Yeah, of the Cold War. And we see the same kind, kind of thing happening in Southeast Asia with the French, except that the French were not really fighting against communism. They were fighting to maintain their empire in Southeast Asia. But what, and they were at war there for a long period of time. It was devastating. It was very costly to the French, but they were able to convince the Americans that it was also part of this cold war. And so the Americans started to back the French, and then when the French were finally driven from Southeast Asia, the Americans stepped in, in their place. So really what we saw happening was that the United States assumed I responsibility for a war, in theory, in favor of defending democracy. But what was, in fact a colonial war that was trying to perpetuate the french empire, essentially. Right. So from the point of view of the people of Vietnam, the american intervention wasn't an intervention that was going to save democracy. It was an intervention that was going to perpetuate colonialism. And so the Americans were unpopular, basically, with almost everybody in Vietnam. And so when we look at, for example, the history of the United States, when the United States goes to Vietnam, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was almost unanimously adopted by the House and the Senate. Right. But I. And so we can see then that when Americans went to Vietnam, they went there with this idea that this was a good thing, that this is what they were. It was their mission to defend and spread democracy. But as time goes by, and not that much time, we start to realize. Americans start to realize that what the United States says it's doing is not what it's actually doing. United States isn't defending democracy. The United States is just basically propping up a regime that can't survive. Okay. And what makes this even worse is that the United States relies on a draft, meaning that everybody that's graduating from high school, basically the 18 year olds, and are subject to the draft. And it doesn't take long for them to realize that being drafted and being sent to Vietnam isn't patriotic, or at least it doesn't seem patriotic to them. And so there will be a mass anti war movement that will eventually lead to the whole population, eventually will become pretty much anti war. Okay, so now what we really see then is that the turmoil of the 1960s will lead to the, well, Carter calls it malaise. It will lead to the Malays of the seventies, meaning that with the loss of the Vietnam War and with the Watergate and some of the cultural things that happened in the early part of the seventies, America will lose its sense of confidence in itself in many ways. Right. So if we look back at the beginning of the 1960s, the Americans were convinced that they were at the forefront of history and that what they were, they were the good guys and what they were doing was. Right. But by the time we get to the middle of the 1970s, Americans are questioning their role in the world. A lot of other people are as well. Right. And you can see that then in the national consciousness that Americans start to question whether or not this idea of defending liberty, expanding liberty, is something that Americans should be doing. And so if you are a young scholar at this period of time, you go to college, and you get your graduate degree and you start to study. But you're now studying from a different ontological outlook from the one that Frederick Jackson Turner had, because Frederick Jackson Turner lived with an ontology of the ever expanding progress of the United States. And now the scholars of the 1970s are going to be questioning that and now have a more negative view of american expansion. And that becomes kind of manifest in a book that was written. It was published in, I think, 1983, and it's called the legacy of conquest by Patricia Limerick. And what this book does is, as it says here on the screen, rejects the Turner thesis. And instead it describes what happened in the west as a kind of a crime, that the Americans, driven by the profit motive, go into the west and they basically destroy things, ruin the environment, kill people, take over whatever they want, and it's all in the name of profit. Okay, so this is a very different outlook, obviously, than what Frederick Jackson Turner had. This is a much more critical outlook. And when what we see happen, this is kind of the first of a series of different works that come from this period of time that will question or try to, I guess you could say, reinterpret our understanding of what happened in the west. And so this group of historians will be called the historians of the new west. The new west. Okay. It's not that the west actually changed. All the things that happened in the west have already happened. They don't change. But the way that we tell the story of what happened has changed. And what caused that change in the way that we tell the story, it wasn't that the events themselves changed. It was that we changed. So what's ontological then, is ontological on who we are, and then that informs how we're going to look at events that happened in the past and in the present. Okay, well, why is this important? Well, the reason why it's important is that we look at Frederick Jackson Turner's writing and we conclude that his ontological outlook is that of an expanding american progress. And then we look at Limerick's writing and we say that her writing is also a manifestation, but this is of a kind of an America in decline, in a way. Right. What that means then, is if we try to understand why Turner wrote what he wrote and why people in the 19th century did what they did, but we do it from an ontological outlook that's our own and not theirs. We can't understand it. We can't see it. We can only see our own judgment of it. Okay, so the challenge for historians is to essentially try to put ourselves in the shoes of the actors of the time. That doesn't excuse what they did. We can look at, for example, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington owning slaves. We can't condone them owning slaves, but we can understand why they thought it was okay to own slaves, not why we think it. We don't think it's that way. We're not going to change our mind about that. We can understand why they thought it was okay. You follow? So that's the importance of what's ontological. We have to understand the point of view of where the author is coming from or where the actor is coming from. So now let's think about, okay, well, Frederick Jackson Turner paints this picture of this american progress, expansion into the west, and Patricia Limerick paints this picture of. Of american conquest, of american greed. And which one of these is true? And the answer is both of them are true to a certain extent, and both of them are false, but they're only true in their own ontological context, and they're false in a different ontological context.",133
26,"US2: 134 -US2: 134
","So I want to spend a little bit of time now talking about some definitions, and that's kind of the thing that we've been aiming at today, and some of these I've already talked about. So historiography, the study of historical writing, or how do we. History of how we tell the story over time. Right. Which I. Which we saw today. We saw Frederick Jackson Turner tell the story one way, and we saw Patricia Limerick tell it a different way. Okay. Ontology, an implicit organization of the world and its inhabitants. What does that mean? It's implied. Everybody knows it, but it's not stated. It doesn't have to be stated. Okay? Everybody just knows that. And that's something we'll have to actually wrestle with more as we go through the course because it really only makes sense to understand what people are doing if we understand their point of view. Okay, then here's a couple of terms that you're probably not familiar with, and these aren't really kind of common terms, but they're terms I found in a book that I like a lot, and it describes the challenge for historians, because we'll say, okay, there's historicity one and historicity two. Historicity one is what happened, and historicity two is what is said to have happened. All right. Obviously they're not the same thing. What happened is what happened, but what is said to have happened is influenced by ontology. Right. So, for example, just not long ago, there was a Super bowl, and the Super bowl was between Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Kansas City Chiefs. And the Buccaneers won the Super bowl, and the score was 31 to nine. I think something like that. I don't really watch football, but I know this happened. Now, if I'm a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan and you asked me about that game, I would say, well, that was a great game. I love that game because our guy, Tom Brady won another ring. And, you know, the Tampa Bay has not won the Super bowl. And it's just, you know, a very positive experience for me. But if you ask somebody who's a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs, they'll say, that was a horrible game. I mean, it was awful. It just was embarrassing. And it's almost hard to take. I almost want to cry or something like that. Right. And you can see what we've, what we've just done is that we've taken the same historicity one and we've created two very different narratives. Right. And what drives that narrative? What drives the narrative is our own ontological point of view. Am I a Chiefs fan or am I a Buccaneers fan? You follow what I'm saying? So this is something we have to think about whenever we're considering what happened in the past, because we're going to look at secondary sources. I'll tell you what that is in a second. People who have interpreted what happened, like Frederick Jackson Turner interpreted what happened, or Patricia Limerick interpreted what happened, and they interpret it from their own ontological point of view. And on top of that, we have our own ontological point of view. So we might now think that Frederick Jackson Turner is full of beans and that Patricia Limerick is closer to the mark. That's our own ontological point of view, and we have to be able to recognize that as well. Okay, so that's history. One, historic city two, the challenge of how you weigh what happened against what is said to have happened. All right? And then finally, sources that historians use, generally texts, but can also be photographs and media, things like that. Right? But a primary source is an uninterpreted document, and a secondary source is an interpretation of a primary source. So in this case, we could say that primary source is declaration of Independence. The secondary source is my book telling you what the Declaration of Independence means. Okay? So the primary source is not interpreted, it just is what it is, and the secondary source is an interpretation of that document. Okay, we could also look, for example, at the two works we looked at today, Turner's thesis, which we could now, because it's well over 100 years old, consider to be a primary source, and Patricia Limerick, who is interpreting that document. Okay, so we could say, okay, the Turner thesis is a primary source, and the Limerick book is an interpretation of that source. So Turner Turner's thesis is a primary source, and Patricia Limerick's thesis, or Patricia Limerick's book, is a secondary source and interpretation of Turner's primary source. And so that's the lecture, I guess you could say, for today, this is Professor Cox signing off. Live long and prosperity.",134

","The first thing we're going to do is we're going to talk about America. So we haven't talked about America at all yet. We've been talking about Europe. And the first thing that we want to do is we want to talk about what was in America before the Spanish got here. And the way that we're going to understand the encounter between Europeans and Americans is by looking at the economics of it, right? The economics of colonization. The idea here is that the way that Europeans behaved towards Americans was colored by what kind of a society, what kind of an economic society they lived in. All right? So just right off the front, we need to understand that the Europeans came to America to make a profit, all right? And depending on what kind of a society they found in America, depended on how they were going to make that profit, okay? So when we look at the Americas at beginning, say, of the 16th century, we can see two different kinds of societies that have developed, and we're going to characterize them by either a surplus economy or a subsistence economy. And surplus economy means that they make more than they need to live, that a certain group of the population is able to make more than is needed for everybody to live. So the surplus then goes to the top, and we'll talk about more in a second. In a subsistence economy, like a hunter gatherer society, these are people that basically wander around looking for foraging for food and hunting and things like that. And it has a very different social structure. So when the Spanish first came to America, they came to the Caribbean. And in the caribbean islands, the natives there had a subsistence economy. And in a subsistence economy, everybody works to create enough for everybody to live. And so there's this basic equality that's built into a subsistence economy. Everybody is needed in order to produce enough for everybody to live. And that also means that everybody is engaged in producing what's needed to live. So nobody's really freed up to do other things. And what happens, and this happens everywhere. It doesn't happen just in America. It happens. It happened in Mesopotamia. It happened in China and Africa and in Europe. And what happens is that at some point, this subsistence economy, this non sedentary group, is going to access a source of food that will make it possible for them to settle. So the reason why they've been moving around, they've been sedentary. They've been non sedentary. They've been moving around is because they needed to follow the food supply. But if they create a local food supply that they don't have to move to access like planting corn or something like that, then they can stay in one place. And then once they stay, they start to stay in one place, then they will start to build structures, okay? And these structures, more permanent structures like, you know, houses and. And then later, you know, temples and other buildings like that are going to, they essentially start to build cities, right? So the greek word for city is chivas, right? And that's where we get our word, civilization. So when we look at what we think, what, in a technical term is civilization, it just means that people have, have organized to live in cities. It doesn't have a qualitative aspect like we, like Europeans have assigned to it. So often we think about, well, there's civilized people, and then there's savages, right? And civilized people are good and savages are bad. Right? Well, the reality is that there are people who have organized themselves to live in cities, and there are people who have not organized themselves to live in cities, and they don't have any. They're not qualitatively different. You can't say one is good and the other is bad. It's just different. Okay? So at any rate, the point is that once they've settled down and they've started to build their cities, they are eventually what ends up happening is that they can, that the people who are. What happens is that the structure starts to stratify, meaning that instead of everybody being on the same level, certain people will be freed up to do other things. So this is actually a representation of what we call the aztec social society, social hierarchy, although they didn't call themselves Aztecs, but we'll just let that go for now. But what happened was, in the beginning, it was everybody creating enough for everybody to live. But after a while, the social society started to stratify. And so we can see at the time of the discovery, there were these different levels of society. There were, at the bottom, slaves who were sacrificed and then slaves who worked. And then there's a group called miekis were like peasants. They're like kind of like cappuccinos today. Or if you go, like when you go down to Home Depot and you see a bunch of people waiting for work, it's like that. Those would be the Maillekis. And then the masiqual team are the craftsmen, the people who own their tools, and they work in the cities, and they actually have ownership society. And it's these bottom four groups that will make enough that other people can, can pursue other pursuits. Right? So. So the, the boshteka are going to be the merchants that will be traveling around. The pupil tin are going to be the nobles and the warriors, the war leaders. And then at the top, there's the tlatawani, which is at the time of the. At the time of the discovery of America. That was Montezuma II. We call him Montezuma, and we think of him as the emperor. But it wasn't really an empire in the way that we would think about it. And I'll talk about that in a minute. Right. So, at any rate, when. When the Spanish came, they found one of these two kinds of societies, right? So the first one they found in the Caribbean was this kind, and the later they found this kind in Mexico, right? And then later in Peru. Okay, the question we want to ask ourselves is that if we're going to look for value, if I'm a European coming to America and I'm looking for a place to extract, a way to extract value, how will I do that? Where is the value located? All right? And if we look in this social structure, we have to ask ourselves, is the value in the people or is it in the land? What do you guys think it's going to be in the people? Keeping in mind that there's only enough produced for everybody to live, there's nothing left over, right. So if they're not making anything that's left over, then the people would not be a source of wealth, right. Instead, they would have to extract the wealth from the land. That would mean that rather than letting the people extract value because there isn't anything left over, then they use the land to extract value. And then what happens to the people? You don't need them anymore. Right. So they'll be enslaved or they'll be pushed out or they will be killed. One of the things that we'll notice is that in the Caribbean, most of the native, almost all of the native population was completely wiped out, right, through disease and other things. It's not like, it's not like they went on a killing spree or anything like that, but the whole population essentially was wiped out. And the only thing you remember of the Carib Indians is the name, the Caribbean, right? So, so, at any rate, that's going to be. The Spanish come to America. They find this area where they want to extract value. The only place they can extract value from is the land. So they move the people off the land, right? And they. And they. And they use the land for themselves. Okay? Now, in this structure, this is a different structure because you have the bottom group making enough enough for everybody to live on. And in the top group is freed up. There's a surplus. Right? So now if we look at where are we going to find value in this society? Is it in the people or is it in the land? In the people. In the people, because the people are producing value. Okay, so. So the spanish strategy, when they see these kinds of societies, is to just cut off the top and put themselves up there, right? So in the beginning, the first, the conquest of Mexico, Montezuma II was the emperor, the Klatawani, the head, and all of the money went up to Montezuma. But what happened was that the Montezuma was killed, and the Spanish theoretically put the king of Spain at the top, which means that all of the wealth that's being produced by the society will, instead of going to the nobles of the Aztecs, will go to the nobles of the Spanish. You follow, sam? So now, so now one of the things that we'll notice is that if you're a Spaniard and you want to extract value, the destruction of the people in this bottom area is going to be really essential. But the destruction of the people here would be destructive of the source of wealth. It'd be like killing the goose that laid the golden egg. What that means is that the Spanish are going to be interested in maintaining this social structure, right? Because this social structure is, is producing wealth. If they. If they destroy the social structure, they destroy the source of their wealth. You see what I'm saying? Well, the reason why this is important, and we'll talk a little bit more about this later today, is because when we think about the conquest of Mexico, we think of the bloodthirsty Spanish coming to America and wiping out all the Indians and taking their stuff, right? And in effect, that is what happened. But it wasn't what the Spanish intended. So something happened that caused a rapid and drastic decline in population that wasn't really initiated intentionally by the Spanish. What was that? What caused the Indians to die? A disease. Disease, exactly. The Europeans introduced diseases that the Spanish had no immunity to and, excuse me, that the natives had no immunity to, and that caused a rapid decline. And with that decline in population, we also see a collapse of this social structure. Right? So, in essence, the wealth producing machine is going to be killed off by the Spanish, but not intentionally. All right. Okay. Let me just mention something else here. We use the word Indians. The reason why I use that word is because we know what we're talking about when we say Indians, but we also know that, um, that the people who live in the Americas were not from India. Right? So. So, uh, to say that everybody in North America is an Indian is like saying everybody from Belfast to Beijing is a Mexican. Right. Okay. It's really inaccurate historically, right? Or genealogically, I guess you could say. But it is a word that we can use, that we can. We can generalize the population that way, and we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the course.",141
28,"US1: 142 -US1: 142
","All right. Well, now there's different groups of natives living in the Americas that the Spanish will encounter. As I already mentioned to you, the Spanish encountered the natives in this, in the Caribbean first, who were a subsistence economy, and then later, they would actually, they encountered the Mayans first. But their major, their main advance, I guess, or aggression, you could say, was against this group of natives here, which we call the Aztecs. And if you look at this is, it's hard to see on this slide, but if you look on this map here or this map down here, the purple area is designated the aztec empire, right? Well, that's a misnomer in many different ways. Okay, so the first thing is that the group that is dominant in this area are called Mexica, and that's where we get the word Mexico. And the reason why they're dominant is because they were at one time a group of outsiders, right? Because what you'll see on this map, you see the colored area is the civilized area, and the, the yellow area here is the really non sedentary area. Okay? There. There are some civilizations up here, but for, for looking at the spanish empire, we'll look at this part. Okay? And so this group, this area had been civilized for a long time. And if you look at the, this area here, right? You'll see. And again, it's very difficult to see on this screen, but there are a number, really, there are hundreds, almost 700 different cities in this area. And they're like the city states of ancient Greece. So each one has its own leader and its own rule set, its own culture, its own politics, its own gods, right? There's. There's a, there's a common culture among all of these based on the language and the name. The language is Nahuat, which is a language that's still spoken in, in Mexico, in the center of Mexico, because this whole area, what really unified this area wasn't politics. It was the language. Right? The language and the culture, the gods. The set of gods and that sort of thing that went with it. Okay? And it's called Nahuatl, based on the Nawat language. Okay? So all. All of these little different city states were, had in common. It's very much like in Europe. If we think about Europe at this time. You know, there was England and there was France and there was Germany and there was Spain. And each one of those little areas was divided up into a bunches and bunches of other little areas, and they all had their own languages and their own dialects, but there was a common language, the language, Latin, that all the people spoke in common. That's called the langua franca. And that's what we see here. There's. There's all these different little political areas, but they all have the language, the one language in common. So each group would speak their own language, plus Nahuatl. Does that make sense, you guys? Okay, so. So now when the. The Mexica, they were among the non sedentary people who moved into this area, they were interlopers. And. And the reason why this area was a target for. For the so called non civilized people was because this is where all the wealth was. Right? So if you could get into this area, you could take stuff, and you. In order to do that, obviously you had to be very warlike. And the Mexico were okay. And so they moved in here. They were not wanted. They were not welcomed by the other groups in the area. And so they were essentially consigned to an area in the middle of a lake right in the valley of Mexico. And in that, what they did was they actually built a city on the lake. The name of the city was Tenochtitlan. And the center of Tenochtitlan is where the center of Mexico City is today. Right. So that whole area in the center of Mexico. I don't know if you guys have ever been to Mexico City, but there's an area called the Sokolo, which is a square, a great square in the middle of the city that was underwater originally. And there's actually a. If you're down there, they have a pole outside the national cathedral that shows where the water level was. So all that was underwater. But the natives built that up. The Mexica built that up. And then, being very warlike, they became dominant among the Nahuat by not. By creating a land empire like we would think of it. Like, for example, in the Roman Empire, at the height of the Roman Empire, they built a wall, and they said, okay, everything on this side of the wall is the roman empire. Everything on the other side is not the roman empire. Instead of that, what the. The Mexica did was they essentially were shakedown artists. They would go to the different cities with their armies, and they would say, okay, let's make a deal. You get, you pay up, and we won't kill you. Right? Essentially. Right. And so what would happen would be then that they would subdue a city by demanding tribute. And then if the city agreed to pay the tribute, then they would be left alone except for collection of the tribute. And the tribute would be like turquoise and cacao beans and gold and things like that. But the main point here is that as long as they paid up, they were free to do whatever they wanted. So they weren't, they didn't have a sense of a unified nation. They didn't, they didn't really owe allegiance to the Mexica. They just had to pay up. Okay. And so you can imagine that that kind of a situation will lead to a lot of resentment because essentially what, the Aztecs or the Mexica were tax collectors and, and nobody likes the tax collector, right. So, and there wasn't any sense of unity among these different groups. And so when the Spanish came, what they found was that there were a lot of unhappy subjects of the Aztecs or the Mexica, and they could exploit that to bring about the fall of the Mexica, which we'll talk a little bit about more in a few minutes. You might want to, you might wonder why they're called Aztecs. And the reason why is because in the 19th century there was a german scholar, I guess you could say Alexander von Humboldt, and he theorized that the place where the natives came from, the Mexica, was called aztlan. And nobody actually knows where aztlan was. That's what the natives themselves said, that they came from aztlan. But if they came from Aztlan, then that would mean that they were Azteca, right? Azlan leads to Oz deca. Okay, so, so that's where we get the word Aztec. But nobody called them Aztecs until the 19th century. Well, okay, so there's two other groups we're going to talk about. The, the next group also is united by language. The, the Mayans. They're, they're only united by, by, by language. And that's one of the things that's accurate about this map. If you look at the map, it says that it looks, it calls this the mayan cultural area. And what was, is there were, there were 52 different groups of natives in here who all spoke a similar language, Mayan. But they were, they were at, they were always at war with each other. They were constantly at war with each other. And not only that, when the Spanish came, they found cities, but really nobody was living in them. And the question then becomes, well, were they not living in the cities because these cities were just for ceremonial purposes or would, did they at one time live in the cities and then move out? And we don't really know the answer to that. But the second one probably is closer to the truth because, because in the cities they were vulnerable. And so what they, what they did was they were driven out into the countryside where they could evade marauding armies from. From the other cities. Right. The main point here is that the Mayans were very warlike, very hostile. They were hostile to the Spanish and they were hostile to each other, and they would remain that way all the way up into the 19th century. All right, questions? Comments? So when you talk about, if anybody says anything about the mayan empire, there was never a mayan empire. Okay? The Mayans were always divided and the Spanish were able to take advantage of that. All right, then lastly, we have the inca of Peru. The Inca were different from the, from the Mesoamericans because they actually were an empire like the roman empire. And what had happened within basically the last hundred years before the Spanish arrived was that a group of natives was able to conquer and unify all of this area. And the strength of this was that everybody was acculturated into the Aztec, into the Inca empire, which meant that everybody owed allegiance to the great Inca Inca. But the problem with that was that all of the authority was located in the person of the great Inca, who at the time of the spanish arrival, was Atahualpa. And so what that meant was that whatever the Inca said, everybody had to do and what would end up happening is that Spanish, under Pissarro, will take Atahualpa hostage and force him to order the delivery of gold. And that's going to be essentially because they control the authority, they are able to control the empire. This mighty huge empire essentially will fall under the dominion of the Spanish because they were able to take away the leader. All right, so this is what we see the Spanish encountering when they come to America.",142

","Let's talk about Spain. Now, Spain is a little bit different from the rest of Europe that we've been talking about, and that's because Spain, for much of the Middle Ages was dominated by the Muslims. Actually, there was a constant warfare that was happening between Muslims and Christians in Spain in the year. I can't remember the year. I think it was four something. I don't know why I can't remember. But any rate, there was. The spanish peninsula was invaded by Moors under the rule of the islamic empire. And this crossing, they crossed over into Spain at a place called Hibaltarique, which is now called Gibraltar. And they were able to overrun the spanish peninsula, really, all the way up into France. And then the French, they weren't actually french at the time. They were Franks. But the Franks under Charles Martel are going to be able to repel the Aztecs, and they are forced across. There's a mountain range here called the Pyrenees. And this mountain range is what separates Spain from the rest of Europe. So Spain was under the influence of the Moors or the Arabs, the Muslims, until. Throughout the period up until 1492. Okay, so. So the only part of Spain that wasn't conquered by the Moors was. Oh, I. Yeah. Okay. The only part of Spain that wasn't conquered by the Moors was this area here, Asturias. Okay, now, I can remember the year. The year was 711. And the reason why we can remember that is because that's where you get your beer and cigarettes, at 711. Right? So that's how I remembered it. But anyway, the year 711, the Moors come and they conquer everything except for this territory. And then what happens is that there's this constant warfare for 700 years where you can see the Moors being pushed back further and further by the Christians. Okay? So this is really a religious war, a religious war between the Christians and the Muslims. And what that does is it creates a society that is ultra catholic. They are the most catholic country because they are united by their religion. And they're also warlike people, a people with a military tradition. Okay? And then in the year 1492, the last of the moorish kingdoms, Granada, was conquered. Okay? And what ends up happening then is that the spanish peninsula will be united under two christian monarchs called the catholic kings. The two christian monarchs are Ferdinand and Isabella. We call them the kings, but it's actually a king and a queen. Right? And the. The kingdoms were united by the monarchy. And so what we have then emerging in 1492 is a powerful, unified christian nation with a militaristic tradition and religious zeal. And they will be now that the, the conquest of, or the reconquest, they call it lare conquistador. I think I've written it down here somewhere. Let me just write it here for you. Okay. La reconquista means the, the reconquest. Right. Once that's completed, then they're going to be looking for ways to expand. All right. Questions, comments about this? All right, so, so now the Spanish are able to complete la reconquista. And because, as I mentioned to you before, the, the, the conflict was a religious conflict that meant that once they had reunited the peninsula, they wanted to reunite it in terms of its religion as well. And so one of the things that happens in the year 1492 is that the Jews are expelled. They've gotten rid of the Muslims. Now they're going to get rid of the Jews so they can be purely catholic in, in Spain. And that will be true really in the rest of the spanish empire as well once there is one, which there isn't yet. Okay. So, and then finally they're going to be looking for ways to expand.",143

","During the Middle Ages in Europe. We've already mentioned on another day that Europe was backwards politically and socially and economically from many other places in the world, including Asia and Africa. And so there wasn't a lot of trade. Okay? The trade that did happen happened over land. There was the Silk road, these kind of red roads here. Red lines were built by the Mongols. And what it did was it connected Europe with the riches of the east. The problem that the Europeans had was that they really didn't have anything to trade. Okay? So there wasn't. Europe didn't really have anything that the Asians wanted, and so the trade was minimal. Okay? And all what trade that there was happened over land, okay? Now, now, at the same time, there was a lucrative trade between East Asia and the east coast of Africa that was accomplished by muslim traders who were, you know, traded over water. Okay? So there's a trading network here that's an ancient and lucrative trading network, but it's not connected to the Europeans because Europeans essentially don't have anything to trade. In the 1450s, the king of Portugal will sponsor the discovery of a new technology that allows Europeans to sail away from land. Okay? So. So now, one of the problems that Europeans had was that they couldn't sail out of sight of land because they would get lost. They didn't have compasses. They didn't have sex nests. They didn't know where they were. And if you sailed away from land, you. You might not be able to find it again, okay? And so they had to stay within sight of land. Okay? But with the. The invention of the compass and the. And the sextant, it was possible to navigate by the stars. So you could go away from the land and you could, uh, you could still know where you were. Okay? Uh, and so what happens is then that Europeans start to, uh, to. To venture out into the ocean, and they will eventually find, you know, a series of islands out here called the, uh, the Azores and the canaries, right? And these islands, what will happen is that the Europeans will conquer these islands and enslave the people, right? Now, what's really interesting about that is that all the people in these islands are white. So what that means is that the Europeans use of slavery didn't really have much to do with race at that time. It had more to do with, you know, what. What could I use for labor to create profit, all right? And they used the white natives here, okay? But any rate, the point is that as they continued to sail, they found their way around Africa, okay? And this is the Portuguese. Now, I'm talking about one of the things that drew them around Africa was this legend of a place that was so wealthy that the king was covered in gold, and that would be El Dorado, the. The golden one, right, or the gold gilded one, I guess you could say. All right, so. So they. They believed that El Dorado was somewhere in East Africa, and so they kept exploring until eventually they found their way around the cape and into the Indian Ocean. And once they got into the Indian Ocean, they discovered these trading routes that the Muslims had been operating for years. Okay? And the Portuguese had a technological advantage over the Muslims because one of the technologies that the Portuguese had developed was brass cannon. Right? So the Portuguese were literally able to blow their competition out of the water, and they established a carrying trade. Carrying trade. It's kind of like an early modern ups. Right? They would. They would get stuff in one place and they would take it to another place, and they would trade what they had carried for something else, and then they would take it that to someplace else and they would continue trading. And then all of the money from that trade is going to eventually make its way back to Portugal. So Portugal will become really a wealthy trading nation. Okay? So now if we look, then if we, at the time of La Reconquista in 1492, there's trade with Europe. Keeping in mind that Europe doesn't have much to trade. What the Portuguese are trading is their navigation technology, essentially. But there's trade with Europe. Some of the trade is over land, and that trade is dominated by the Italians, the Venetians, and the Genoese. Right? And then there's trade over water, and that trade is dominated by the Portuguese. Right? And now we have this appearance of a new, aggressive nation that wants to expand, but there really is no place for them to expand to. They can't expand into the. Into the. Into the overland trade because the overland trade is controlled by the Italians. And they can't expand into the over water trade because it's controlled by Portuguese.",144

","So now there's this guy. His name is Christophero Cologne. Christophero Cologne. Christobal Cologne. Right? And Cristobal Cologne is actually a genoese sailor, and he sailed with the Portuguese. And he has developed an idea that comes from some of the ancient writings that came into the east from this period of time that calculates that if he sails west, he will find the indies somewhere in here. Okay, do you see what I'm looking at right on the map? Okay? Now, those calculations were wrong, obviously, but most people in Europe just laughed at him because they knew that, first off, you know, that the idea that everybody thought the world was flat is pretty wrong, all right? I mean, some people may have thought the world is flat, like some people today believe the world is flat, right? But most people who were educated knew that it wasn't flat. And the reason why they knew that was because if you stand at the shore and you watch a ship go out, right, you can see maybe 11 miles, something like that, right? Um, and then after that, you can't see it anymore. So it's gone. Where did it go? Did it go over the edge of the earth? No, because it comes back. Right. So, so that means then that. That the very act of observation proves that there's a curve of the earth. And the fact that you can measure that curve means that you can know about how big the world is, okay? And. And so the Europeans knew not only that the world was a globe, but they knew about how big it was. All right? And that's why they knew that Columbus was wrong, because they knew that China wasn't going to be here. It was going to be over here somewhere. And they knew that you could never sail from Spain or from Europe all the way to China. You couldn't carry enough food and water to do it. Okay? What they didn't know was that there was the Americas in between. Nobody knew about the Americas. All right? So, Chris Columbus, that's what we call Cristobal Cologne is Columbus. We call him here in America. Christobal Cologne isn't able to convince anybody that's educated that his idea is correct, except that he is able to convince the queen of Spain, Isabella, who we just talked about a couple minutes ago. And so she actually sponsors an expedition with three ships, an ina napinta and the Santa Maria. And Columbus then sails off into the west to find the Indies. And on October 12, 1492, he cites land. Okay? And actually, nobody really knows what land he sighted, but most people think it was probably Hispaniola, which is where Haiti is today. I don't know if I've got a better map here. Yeah, most people think it was here somewhere in here. Okay. The main thing is that he spied spotted land, and then, you know, he took out his, you know, telescope or whatever, and looked, and there were a whole bunch of natives on the land, you know, jumping up and down and saying, hooray, we've been discovered, right? No, that's not what happened, but. But it is a discovery that the Europeans discovered that there was something between Europe and Asia, and the Americans discovered that there were people who would eventually be a great threat to them. Columbus finds the Americas, grabs some Indians to take back to show everybody what he found, right? And he believes that he has found the Indies, right? The East Indies. Okay, well, he hasn't found the East Indies. He hasn't found any Indies. He's found Americans. But because he believes it's the Indian. The Indies. That's why everybody here is called Indians, even though there aren't any Indians here. The Indians are all in India. Okay. You know what I mean? You follow what I'm saying here? All right? And then, actually, Columbus will make four different voyages to America, trying to find the Indians or the Chinese, and never, never able to find them. And the reason why is because they're not. There aren't any Chinese here, okay? What they eventually realized was that they hadn't found Asia, but instead they had found Novo Mundo. What does that mean? New world. A new world, right? So it's kind of like, if you think about it from a european point of view, it's very much like discovering a whole new planet, right? It's far away, and there's this, you know, whole huge territory filled with, you know, strange people, right? So it's a whole new world. And the guy who really was able to theorize that, to realize that his name was Amerigo Vespucci, and so because he was the one who really remember or discovered that, I guess you could say we named the whole thing after him. So all of the Americas. Americas are named after Amerigo Veswucci. The rest of the story of the conquest, you can read about in the.",145

","I want to talk about a specific aspect of the spanish empire. I'm going to start off by saying that when the Spanish came, as I already mentioned to you, they didn't come because they were. Because of their sense of adventure. They came because they wanted to make money. And the people who came to America were the adventurers. Most of them didn't come to America because they wanted to live way out in the middle of nowhere, a little house in the prairie, right? Most of them came because they wanted to exploit the land, get as much wealth as they could, and go back to Spain, where they could live like Hidalgos. Right? Hidalgo is hijos de algo, right? Son of something, right? Big shots, essentially. Right. The optimum situation for them would have been to find, you know, El Dorado, big pile of gold, grab the gold and go back, right? They couldn't do that. So they realized eventually that they were going to have to exploit the land, especially in the Caribbean, as I mentioned, because it was a subsistence economy. They actually tried to enslave the natives in the Caribbean, but the natives didn't survive. They weren't good slaves, and they didn't survive. So they would have to replace that later, and we'll talk about that on a different day. But the point is that what ends up happening is that the people who came to. To conquer America and to extract the value did it because they wanted to make money, okay? And so what ends up happening is that rather than being able to divide up a bunch of gold that they were able to steal, instead they actually ended up dividing the land. And what they divided the land into was called encomiendas. Right? Now we just say it that way. There's actually two different words for that in Spanish, the encomienda and the repatrix. But mostly it's called the encomienda system. We'll call it that. And the encomienda system is very much like the feudal system. I don't know if you remember the drawing that I made. Let me see if I can do it here. The drawing that I made of the feudal system Europe was that there was. There was an area of land that we would call the thief, and on the land there was a manor where the lord lived, and then there was a village, and there were fields of the lord, and there were commons, right? And the encomienda system is going to be similar to this, because in what will happen is that essentially the king still owns all of the land, but he's going to allow an encomendero to use the land. And his use of the land is going to be to profit from the work of the campesinos or the Indios, right? All right, so instead of peasants, we have indios. Instead of lords, we have encomenderos, right? The theory was that just like in Europe, the indios could use the land and they could support themselves on the land as long as they paid labor to the encomendero, right? And then in return for that, the encomendero was supposed to provide protection and christian indoctrination. The reality was the. Well, I mean, the reality was that the source of income that the encomendero was going to get came from the labor of the Indios. What's the problem with that? What's happening to the Indios? They were dying. They were dying. What were they dying of? Disease. They were dying of diseases, right? And so what would, what we see happening with the encomienda system is that the source of income for the encomendero, small and decreasing. And then once the indios have all died, there won't be any more profit. And so what the response of the encomaderos is, is to work the indios as hard as they can so that they can produce as much as they possibly can in order to give the encomendero as much profit as he can get. Because once they're dead, that's the end of the prophet. And hopefully he'll have enough to go back to Spain and live like an hidalgo. Okay, so what ends up happening then is that the encomenderos are working the Indians hard because they're dying. But what's going to happen is that there's going to be a priest. His name is Bartolome de las Casas, here. And what Las Casas will argue is that the encomenderos are working the Indians to death right? Now. That's not exactly correct, because the Indians were dying, but not because they were being worked to death, but because of disease, right? But nevertheless, they were dying, all right? That doesn't make it any better for the encomenderos, who were just using them for profit, right? But the main thing is that Bartolome de las Casas will publicize what's going on with the Indians in Europe. And a book that he wrote, which in English we call the destruction of the Indies, is going to portray the encomenderos as brutal beasts who are. Who are exploiting the Indians. These, these, it was illustrated with these. I forgot what they call these things. Linotypes or something like that. But at any rate, the point is, you can see here, you know, they're cutting off the Indian's hands and. And they're, you know, running around bleeding and things like that. Now, this is not as this. It wasn't as bad as this, although it was bad, right? But at any rate, the point here is that develop what's called the black legend. The black legend is that the Spanish came to America. They tweeted and killed the Indians and stole all their stuff. And so the black legend then will be associated with, um, spanish colonization in America. From then on, the rest of the Europeans will look and say, oh, look what the Spanish did in, uh, in Spanish America. Ignoring the fact that the French and the British do the same things in North America based on the economics, right? So we'll see, for example, that the British come to North America and eventually drive off all the natives, because the natives are living in subsistence economies and they can't make any money that way. So they drive the natives off the land so they can make money from the land, okay? That's not different from what the Spanish did. Okay, so the Spanish weren't any more or less brutal than any of the other Europeans, okay? It's just that their brutality was more highly publicized. Okay? All right, so now what happens is that this guy, Bartolome de las Casas, gets the attention of the king of Spain, and the king of Spain is going to say that these new people in the Americas are my subjects and they need to be protected. Okay? That's what Las Casas is going to argue. So there's going to be a great debate in a place called Valladolid in Spain. Right? Let me go ahead and write that here. Via lead. I'm sorry, you're going to actually see this in a video that you'll see later on via dolid. But the videos, BBC video. So they mispronounce everything. Anyway, valladolid in Spain. And the debate will between. Be between Las Casas and another guy named Juan Gines de Sepulvera, who the British call Sepulveda. Right. But at any rate, if you were going to actually write this, there would be an accent over the. Over the U. Okay. At any rate, Juan Genesis Sepulveda. All right, so what Las Casas argues is that the natives are rational human beings who deserve the king's protection. And what. What Steph Uvada will argue is that the natives are less than human, not fully human, but they can be educated. They can be made human, educated into humanity. And the price of that education is labor. So on the one hand, Las Casas sees this vast group of people who are being exploited and saying that we don't have a right to exploit them because they're rational human beings who deserve the king's protection. They're just like us. And we see then Sepulveda arguing against that by saying, well, they're not quite human, actually. They're not the same color as us. And not only that, but they aren't civilized like us. And so we can teach them, excuse me, to be civilized, but they have to pay a price for that, and the price is going to be their labor. So on the one hand, we have this kind of condemnation of the encomienda system, and on the other hand, we have an argument in favor of it. Okay? And what's really interesting about this is that this is the first debate in world history on the issue of human rights, who's human and who has rights. It happens first in the spanish empire. And what the king will decide is that Las Casas is right, that las Casas, that the natives are rational human beings and they do deserve the king's protection. And so what will happen is that the king will outlaw the encomienda. Now, it's outlawed in 1542, and there are still encomiendas in the 18th century. And the reason for that is because the application of law in the spanish empire was slow, often very slow. Right? But the main thing is that, in theory, what ends up happening is that the rule of the Indians, the rule of the Americas, goes out of the hands of the conquistadores and into the hands of bureaucrats. And what will happen then is that the, the spanish empire will be divided into vice royalties, where people, the viceroys, actually act in the name of the king. And then that will be divided into other areas, geographical areas, that will eventually end up pretty much following the division of Spanish America into the countries that it is now, and even, for example, in Mexico, of where the states are. Right? But it comes under the rule of the Spanish. So that's going to essentially be the spanish empire, and it won't really change very much for the next 300 years. Okay, we'll talk later in our course about how the empire comes to an end and what the effect of that is going to be on the United States. But for now, we just want to conclude, I guess you could say, that all of the authority in the spanish empire will rest in the king. And the reason why that's important is because if the king is wise, like King Philip was when he called this, this debate. Then the empire is ruled wisely. But if the king's an idiot, which happens, then the empire is ruled idiotically. All right? And that's going to be the weakness of the spanish empire, and eventually it will come to an end.",146

","This week, we're going to talk about Virginia and New England. And today we're talking about Virginia. And Thursday we'll talk about New England, right? Oh, yeah. And so the video that I had you watch, the color of money has to do with the slave trade, the transatlantic slave trade, which will begin for our history in Virginia in 1619. Right. And then. So that's why we read. That's why we watched that movie today. And then we'll talk about it after I'm done with a hopefully short lecture. And then. And then on Thursday, we'll talk about New England, and we'll then also discuss that King Philip's borough. Do you guys remember this slide I showed you last week? And remember that we talked. This is actually. This is Henry VIII up here. Very famous portrait of Henry VIII. And this is the trial of King Charles. You guys remember what happened to King Charles I? It was before the English Civil War. Okay, so the English Civil War lasts from 1643 to 1649. We didn't really talk about that much other than to say that he had a falling out with parliament over raising taxes. But the real issue was who has the right to rule? Is it the king or is it parliament? Right. And so, having said that, and this going along with our questions on the study guide, there are two main issues that we talked about here, going up to where we get to Oliver Cromwell, that are disturbing english politics. And what are those two issues? It's religious war. There was a split within the church that basically caused a reformation of religion. And a lot of England was protestant, or what do you call it? Anglican, I believe, where another part was Catholic. Okay, so that's exactly right. What happens was that England was actually Catholic and all of Europe was catholic. That's why they call it Catholic. Catholic means universal. Right. But there were wars of reformation going on on the continent of Europe over religious dogma, essentially religious doctrine. Okay? That was the war with Martin Luther and the Vatican and King Charles I and all that. Henry actually broke the english church away from the Catholic Church, but not because he disagreed with their doctrine, but because why they wouldn't let him divorce a woman he didn't like because he wanted to marry another one. Exactly. So what that means then, is that when we talk about the reformation, we have to be specific about which reformation we're talking about. Are we talking about the reformation in Europe? Are we talking about Martin Luther's reformation, or are we talking about the English Reformation, which is different. It's a different animal altogether. The Reformation in Europe was over religious doctrine. The Reformation in England was over essentially politics and money, because when Henry made himself head of the church, that meant he owned all the monasteries and he sold, he took all the money from. Away from all the monasteries, right? So politics and money is what drives the English Reformation, and it's different from the Reformation in Europe. You guys got what I'm saying? But at any rate, what happens is that then the question becomes, well, what is going to be the official religion of England? And they go back and forth between different forms of Protestantism and Catholicism. The solution that they came up with in the Reformation was whoever rules chooses the religion, right? So if the monarch in England is Catholic, then everybody in England has to be catholic, right? But if the monarch in England is protestant, and everybody in England has to be protestant. You guys get what I'm saying? But here's the problem. Henry was protestant, Mary was Catholic, and Elizabeth was protestant. You guys get what I'm saying? So during this war, these wars of the Reformation, if you were one religion and somebody else was the other religion, what was your relationship? What were you supposed to do? If I'm catholic and you're protestant, what am I bound to do? It's either that I can convince you to return to the Catholic Church, or then it's my obligation to kill you. Okay, you guys got that? So that's what was causing all the wars, right? Well, anyway, so that's a big issue. And it's a big issue all the way through, because as time went on, England became more and more protestant. But the monarchs were actually catholic. James and Charles were both Catholic. Right. And that was one of the big issues that went into the english civil war. Okay. Because the. Basically what the parliament had said was, we're not going to spend our money fighting against Protestants. All right, did you guys get that? Questions? Comments? Okay, so the next thing then, it has to do with where does the right to rule come from? Before I do that, though, I want to go back one step, right. And I'm going to say that during the reign of James the first, there was a group of Protestants who felt, oh, let's go all the way back. Okay, let's go all the way back to Henry. Okay, all the way back during Henry, right, there was a group of Protestants who were not Anglicans, but were Calvinists. Right. And Calvinists are much more protestant than the Anglicans are. Anglicans are very similar to Catholics. All right? So, in fact, the main difference is just who's the head of the church? But the Calvinists thought that they had a direct line to the exact right church, the right religion, the right relationship with God. And so they had this idea that now that the english church had broken away from Rome, even though they weren't fully calvinist, they could be. They could become Calvinists. So they came up with this idea that they could purify the church from within. Okay. And so those people who thought they could purify the church from within became known as Puritans. Puritans, exactly. Okay. So now when we get up here to James, one group of those Puritans is going to move to Holland because they're going to say, well, we're never going to be able to purify the church from within. We're just going to leave it hanging right there. Okay? So any questions or comments about that? All right. Now, going back then, the other situation was, who has the right to rule? That's really what brings this civil war to a head, because parliament says you can't raise taxes. The right to rule essentially comes from the people. And Charles says, no, the right to rule comes from God. And we talked about that last week when we talked about Locke's second treatise on civil government. What happens is there's a civil war. The king is actually captured, put on trial for treason, and beheaded. That's what this trial is here. Right? And then they get rid of the monarchy, and they form what's known as a commonwealth. But the common. And the commonwealth is supposed to be like a republic, okay, with an elected leader and all that stuff, being ruled by parliament, essentially what it was, right? But it ends up being more like a religious dictatorship. Okay? So Oliver Cromwell was the leader of the army. He becomes the leader of England, the Lord protector, and he's going to implement laws that make England not very jolly anymore. It used to be jolly old England, and now it's not very jolly anymore because people are not allowed to drink, they're not allowed to have parties, they're not allowed to have entertainment. They have to go to church. If they don't go to church, they're fined or they're put in stocks and they have to pay the church. And so it's this real strict religious regime, essentially. Right? And the problem with that, of course, is that the english people, they're religious enough, but they're not that religious. They don't want to live under a religious regime. They don't want to give up dancing. They don't want to give up going to plays. They don't want to give up drinking and partying and things like that. And so what ends up happening is, after Cromwell dies, his son will briefly become Lord protector, but then parliament will actually ask for the return of the monarchy. The heirs of Charles actually had fled, and they were living in France. The heir to the throne, who becomes Charles II, is going to be restored to the throne. Okay, so this period of Charles II and James II is called. The English is called the restoration. Okay, the restoration of what? Mainly, it's the restoration of the monarchy. Right. And so there are certain colonies in America that were formed during this time. They're called the restoration colony. One of them is North Carolina. One of them is South Carolina or the Carolinas, essentially, in Georgia. Right. Okay, so now what do you think in America was named after charles? Charleston. Charleston, exactly. Charlestown. Okay, then the next one. Okay, so he rules. He's not very popular, but he's able to keep control of the throne for some period of time. He basically tries to ignore parliament. He goes back to the idea that because I'm king, I was chosen by God and I have a right to rule, and parliament really can't put a check on my power. And he's going to. He's going to. That's going to cause conflict in england, but it won't cause enough conflict to oust him from the throne. But then who's going to succeed him becomes James II. And I be honest with you, I don't know what the relationship. I think they're brothers, but. But I'm not sure. At any rate, James II will then become king. Before James becomes king, he was. He was actually, at one point, the ruler of an area in America which had originally been called New England. Right. So James was the duke of York, and he became the ruler of an area in America that became. That was called New Amsterdam, but was lost by the Dutch to the English. Right. So what do you think in America is named after James? And he took over New Amsterdam. Right. New York. Right. So New York, he becomes the ruler of New York. And one of the things that happens as ruler of New York, he tries to rule with a heavy hand, so much so that the people who live there, who are Dutch mostly, right, eventually refuse to pay taxes. And James has to be recalled to England because. Because the king wants the taxes. He doesn't want his brother to mess that up for him. So at any rate, or whoever this guy is, at any rate. So that shows us the idea that James has as the ruler of England, right. Or as the ruler. And then when he becomes the king of England, he's not only Catholic, but he's also heavy handed in terms of his authority. And that will cause his daughter Mary. Keep in mind, it's a different Mary than this one. Right. His daughter Mary, who will be married to and team up with a guy named William of Orange. Okay, so now Orange is in Holland. It's not in Orange county. Right. But William and Mary then conspire against James II, and they land an army in England in 1688. And this is what's known as the glorious revolution. And the result of the glorious revolution is that William and Mary, James actually flees, William and Mary are placed on the throne, and the parliament is able to establish itself as the actual ruler of England. So the conflict over who gets to rule England is settled during the reign of William and Mary, where England becomes a constitutional monarchy, meaning that it's being ruled by parliament. Questions, comments? Did it. So it stayed a constitutional monarchy up until this day, right? Yeah. It actually became more and more constitutional up to the point that now the king really doesn't have hardly any power. Right. One of the things, I don't know if you guys were paying attention over the weekend, but one of the things that people find amazing, I guess, or interesting is that Charles, the guy who's Charles now, who was the Duke of York, but now is the. Or he was Prince of Wales. Sorry. But now he's the king, King Charles III. And the question is, why did he choose Charles? Because the other two, Charles's were very unpopular. But anyway, so we'll see how that plays out. Anyway, questions? Comments about that? Keep in mind, it has no effect on us in America because we don't have kings. Okay. Just so you know that. All right. I think you knew that already. But just to make that point clear. All right, questions? Comments about any of that? Okay, so. So now we're up to. We have a kind of a background in english history up until kind of the era of the revolution, which is where we're going to go next week. So just keep in mind that we want to know all this is happening in Europe so we can understand what's happening in America.",211

","Today, we're going to actually start talking about politics in the United States. So we've talked about industrialization, we've talked about the movement into the west, and some talk about historiography, and now we're going to talk about industrialization or about politics. And one of the things about the politics of this era is that it is obscure for us. I mean, this era between 1870 and, say, 1915 or so is obscure for us because the, the issues that happened during that time weren't big issues like what happened before the Civil War. The Civil War. They had issues like the tariffs, and they had issues of, you know, can states secede from the Union? The states have to follow federal law, slavery, all these things were big issues that we, we spend a lot of time talking about in american history. But the latter part of the 19th century, we don't spend that much time talking about. And so it's kind of a political black hole in a way. All right. But there's a couple of different reasons for that, which I'll talk about as we go into it. This era is going to be called the gilded age. Does anybody know what gilded means? Gilded means coded. Right? Coded. Exactly. So coated. Coated in gold, say, for example. Right. So, so there was, if you had, like, a gilded chair, right? The gilded chair could be made out of cheap wood and painted over. And then it's got a little gold leaf or not just gold paint on it. It makes it look like it's gilded, like it's actually got gold on it, but it doesn't necessarily have to have gold on it. Right. It could be just gold paint or whatever. So what that means is that the chair looks like it's very expensive, but it's really not. It's really cheap. You know what I mean? And what we see happening is that the gilded outside covers up the less attractive inside. Okay? And that's what we see with american life during this era because it's an erade of rapid industrialization. So we're going to see some people become incredibly wealthy. Right? We're going to see some people in the United states become more wealthy than the emperor of China, but we'll also see massive amounts of people who are living in poverty and being exploited at the same time. So there's this era of not just income inequality, but really mass inequality, and that creates social upheaval. I think this is a good illustration of the era where you have the millionaires here at the top fields, Goulds, Vanderbilt, and they're sitting on top of their millions and they're being held up by the workers who are making, you know, $3 a week or $11 a week, something like that. Okay. This is the kind of the flavor of this era in american politics, and it's in american history, I should say. But it's sadly also representative in many ways of today because we have massive income inequality today. We have a very small number of people who own enormous amounts of wealth and a huge amount of people who own nothing or close to nothing. Right. So I think that we can learn a lot from the gilded Age and the progressive era that we're going to be talking about on Wednesday. All right. All right. Well, going back to then saying that politics was not something that we spend a lot of times thinking about, we have to look at how did people consider the government, right. If I ask you what's going on in the government today, as far as what, I mean, we elected Biden, who's trying to pass the stimulus, extend unemployment. I know Trump is trying to do something with impeachment. Correct. That's all over. But that's a good, that's a great answer. I appreciate that answer. Here's the reason why I, it's so important that you answered the way that you did, because both of you guys are talking about what's going on with the federal government, right? So when I say the government, you think the national government. But at the time we're talking about in the 1860s, seventies and eighties, if I said the government, you wouldn't think about the national government. You would think about your local government. So it would be the city government, the county government, maybe the state government, but the federal government. You knew there was one, but it was far away. It really didn't have any influence on your life. Okay. How many of you guys know who the mayor of San Diego is? Kevin Falconer. That's the old one. Yeah, the new one. But see, you guys are not sure. And how many of you guys know who represents you on the city council? You don't know. Right. So it's really the opposite of that period of time where in that time you knew who was your representative on the city council. It was close to you. And if you really think about it, it makes more sense because if there's a pothole in your street, you're not going to call President Biden and say, look, I need somebody to come and fix my pothole. You're going to call somebody in the city. The local government is the government that has more influence on your life than the national government. You guys get what I'm saying? We'll talk more about that as we go through the course here. But the main thing is to understand that at that time, the national government wasn't the big government. And it doesn't become the big government until really, it starts during World War one, and it becomes kind of, we start to see the beginnings of it in a big way during the Great Depression and World War two. We'll talk more about that again as we go through the course. But the point is, the point that I'm making is that the government wasn't really engaged in big issues or big issues that people really thought about very much. And the issues that it was engaged in were not, were kind of minor compared to the things that had happened before.",211

","Now, I'm going to focus on the settlement of two areas of America, one in Virginia and one in New England. And we're going to talk about Virginia today. And the first thing we want to know, obviously, is that Virginia was founded earlier by people who came to America to make money, okay? So what happened was that there were actually two different companies in England. One was the Virginia company of Plymouth, and the other one was the Virginia company of London. Okay? Virginia company of Plymouth actually was the first, but they sailed off course and ended up landing in New England in the winter time. And so they didn't quite make it. Right. The other one, the Virginia company of London, consisted of 100 gentlemen. Okay? These two companies are actually called joint stock companies. And what happens is that people in England will invest in the company with the idea that these people are going to go to America and they're going to extract value that will make money for the investors. Okay? You guys get what I'm saying? This is very much like the spanish conquest in a way. And this was essentially what the Virginia company of London thought when the first hundred people from England came to Jamestown. All right? Or what we call the tidewater region. So let me show you the map here. The tidewater region is basically this area, Chesapeake Bay. And the reality of settling in the tidewater region was you could not have chosen a less. Less healthy spot to try to form a colony, because there were. There were various diseases and insects and, you know, bad weather, swampy swamps and things like that that caused a lot of sickness in the english settlers. Okay, when they came. But the point here is that when the English came to America, they weren't looking to form a settlement and start a colony. What they wanted to do was to figure out how to make money, right? And you're going to find this. Probably don't know this, but you're going to find this almost comical, and that is that these 100 gentlemen thought that what they would do would be to basically follow the lead of the Spanish. And the idea was that they would take 100 gentlemen and go to America and they would find some great indian empire like Tenochtitlan, and they would conquer that empire and extract all of its value like the Spanish had done. Okay? And since the Spanish had been able to do it with 600, they really thought, well, we only need 100. You guys get what I'm saying? All right? So there was a big problem with their strategy. The big problem with their strategy of coming to America and finding a great indian empire to conquer was what? There was no indian empire. They were all divided into multiple tribes. There was no great indian empire. Remember, we talked about the two kinds of settlement in America last week. We talked about two different economies. Do you remember the two different economies? One that exploited the land and one that exploited the people. And what did we call those? Surplus and subsistence. Remember, the surplus is the one where there's enough people to make enough for everybody and there's something left over. Right? And subsistence was what? What was that economy? Everybody worked to make just enough for everybody to live. Okay? And that's what kind of economy was here, actually, all over North America, for the most part, was a subsistence economy, which meant that there was no great indian empire. And that also turned out to be a real problem for the. For the English. Because the English that came to America because they were gentlemen, they saw it as beneath their station to actually do anything. Physical labor, right? Because a gentleman is supposed to. Is supposed to, you know, serve at court or be a soldier or a lawyer or something like that. A gentleman is not supposed to be a worker on the land or to even do merchant marketing, even to do, you know, trading. Okay? That's beneath the gentlemen. You guys get what I'm saying? So here we have 100 guys that come to America. They're dying like crazy because of the diseases and things like that, and they can't. They don't have enough food, and they don't have any way to get any food because they don't. They. They refuse to work. Right? They just see it as beneath their station. I know it's crazy, but this is the way it worked out, right? Okay, so there. You guys all know the story of Pocahontas, right? You guys have all heard of Pocahontas. You guys watched the Disney movie, right? And Grandma Willow and all that stuff. Actually, Grandma Willow was not real, as far as we know. Okay? And Disney was not even as good of a historian as Neil Young or Bob Dylan. Right? But anyway, the point here is that there was some truth to the idea that the local leader of. The leader of the local natives actually helped the English by giving them food and things like that. So they survived. Right? And then the English thought, well, that's a great idea. We'll just let them take care of us. But the problem, of course, with the English, with the natives taking care of the English was what. What kind of an economy did they have? Subsistence. Subsistence. Exactly. Which meant what? They only had enough for themselves, right? There wasn't anything left over, so they couldn't really take care of the Englishmen. And so the Englishman decided then the best thing to do would be to enslave them. Right. Okay. That doesn't actually work out for them very well because the natives, they're not recognizable one from another, right. So if you had a native slave and he ran away, you wouldn't be able to find them again because they didn't look. They all look the same to the. To the natives, right, to the English. And then on top of that, the natives knew the land much better than the English did. So there's. There was no way they could keep. Actually, just to say it this way. Native american slavery never worked out in North America. It didn't really work out anywhere, but it certainly didn't work out in North America. And so what ended up happening was that we have this group of Englishmen, and then you guys all know the story of John Smith and how John Smith forces them to actually work so they can make it through the winter. And then next year, more people come and the colony starts to grow. But they're really on the hook here because this is a joint stock company, which means what? They're looking for profit investors. Exactly. Because they have to pay after investors. Right. Okay, well, they haven't found any profit. They didn't find any great indian empire. So they look for some way to make money and they settle on tobacco. Right. They grow. They start plantation agriculture, growing tobacco. All right. Basically, the only way you can really grow tobacco is on a plantation. Right. The problem, of course, with plantation agriculture is that you need labor, right? And so what happens is they couldn't get the Indians to work for them, so they start off with indentured labor. Okay? Indentured labor. Indentured labor, essentially, is that you're in England and you see this, this advertisement saying, look, I can go to Virginia and work as a laborer for five years or six years, right? And then at the end of that time, they're going to give me land, okay? And you have to keep in mind that for Europeans at this time, land was exactly the same as money. So this is like saying, I'm going to work for six years and then I'm going to get a lot of money. Okay? You guys are following here. I get. I get free passage to America. I get, you know, room and board and the use of all the tools that I need. And at the end, I get some land and I get the tools that I need to work the land. So that sounds like a good deal, right. Particularly if you're being persecuted in England over your religious affiliations. Right. You guys follow? I'm saying? So a lot of people. Sorry. Was it impossible to acquire land in England? Oh, yeah. All the ends. All the land in Europe was already owned. Right. The only way you could. You could get land in anywhere in Europe was to inherit it or to conquer it. Right. So. So, all right, so. So that's a good question. Now, so here's the problem. That the indentured servitude was not slavery, but it often ended up essentially being like slavery because you were forced to work for the plantation owner until you died. And the reason why was because obviously, the mortality rate was very high because of the bad climate and the bad diseases. Right. And then the owners were actually less than honest. Right. And so what would happen would be that you're working, say, and you get sick, and so you're not able to work for a day that would add on a day at the end of your term. So your term get longer. Right. Or let's say you're working one day and you break a tool. Right. Well, you have to pay for that tool. So they add on 30 days at the end of your. At the end of your term. You guys get what I'm saying? So eventually, what ends up happening is that indentured servitude ends up being like slavery, essentially. Right. And the big problem that the English have, the english owners, I should say, have, is that by now, most of England is protestant, which means that they all know how to read and write. Okay, why do Protestants need to read and write? So they're able to read scripture from the Bible. Exactly. Right. And so what they do is they write back home and say, this is stupid. Don't do it. This is a bad deal. Right. And next thing you know, there's another labor shortage here in. In the tidewater region. Okay, so how do they solve that? Well, then in 1619, there is a visiting ship that was carrying slaves, and they traded those slaves. Those slaves were of african descent. Right. They came from the Caribbean, actually. Right. But they were of act. They were from. They were of african descent, and the tobacco owners settled on the idea that they could actually use them as plantation laborer. And the advantage of that was that they didn't know the land, and they were very easily recognizable because they were black. Right. And so there starts to be a growing black population in the tidewater region. Okay? Most of them being slaves, but not all of them. Some of them were actually free men, but they were free men, like the free white men, which were also very poor, very much at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale. Right? So there were free black men and free white men. Right? And then there were slaves, okay? And there were indentured servants. So essentially there wasn't really any difference between the races. And at this point, racism really doesn't exist. Okay? It does, but not in. Not in the way that we think about it. Okay? And what that means then, is that if you were a white indentured servant, or if you were a white, a poor white free man, and you saw a black free man or a black slave, you would know they were different and you would have different cultures and different. You would be recognizably different to each other, but you wouldn't consider one to be less than the other. You guys get what I'm saying? You wouldn't consider one to be inferior to the other. You follow what I'm saying here? And that's where racism comes in. Okay, let me just mention to you right now, and we'll continue talking about this as we go on. How do you identify racism? Racism is when one group of people looks at another group of people based on some external criteria and decides that those people are irredeemably inferior. I think about Aristotle and natural inferiority. Natural inferiority means that these people are not capable of achieving the same level of humanity as I am because of some inherent characteristic that can't be overcome. Right? Okay. So for example, let me give you. It's a really bad example, but it'll make you understand. It's like a horse. You know, a horse has its. Has its uses, but you would not expect to teach a horse how to talk, right? Because they're physically incapable of talking. You understand what I'm saying? And that's the way they viewed. That's the way a racist views somebody who they're racist against. You guys get what I'm saying? There is this unredeemable, uncorrectable difference between the two on the part of the person that's racist that causes that other person to be inferior. Okay, and so then what is your going, what is going to be your attitude towards somebody that you're racist against? Well, you're either going to be. You're going to be exploitative, meaning that you exploit that person or that person, or you will be exclusive, meaning that you either export them or get rid of them or kill them. Right? Do you guys get what I'm saying? All right, so that's racism. And that's different from other forms of a virgin, which we'll talk about later. Okay? Okay. So here now we have this situation in the tidewater region, and what really ends up being established in the tidewater region is a society that very much resembles medieval Europe. Okay? And if you think about it, in some ways, it is reminiscent of the encomienda, right? But you remember the encomienda was based on medieval Europe, right? And the idea was that all of the value was in the land, that the Lord actually had control of the land and the labor. Right? And that the people who lived on the land owed the Lord labor. Okay? Now, that's basically the same thing here, except for in many, most cases, actually, in the american south, the Lord, what we call the Lord, will actually be a plantation owner, usually not a lord, right. Or not a noble. And then the worker will be a slave. So it's not exactly the same, but the economy is the same in that it's producing agricultural goods. Its value comes from the land.",212

","I'm going to talk about the issues, and then I'm going to talk about the different political parties and how they responded to the issues. Okay? The first thing I want to talk about is patronage. Patronage is political favors in return for political support. Generally speaking, in the american system, political favors are jobs, and political support is votes, right? So essentially what you're doing is you're exchanging votes for jobs. And one place where we can see that, I don't know how much of this you guys remember, but if go back to 2008, when in the democratic primary, we had Obama and Hillary Clinton running against each other, and it became evident that Obama was going to win. And so Hillary Clinton made a deal with Obama, and the deal that she made was that she would endorse him and encourage her supporters to support him in return for her becoming secretary of state. You see what happens? So that's patronage. Patronage happens when you trade your support for a job. And that's something that happens in american politics. It used to happen at every level, right? It started really at the. At the other level, at the other end, where I. You had groups of new voters who are organized into voting blocs. And I'm going to demonstrate that by asking you about Bugs Bunny. How many of you guys have seen Bugs Bunny cartoon? Does anybody notice that in Bugs bunny cartoons, the cops. If there's a cop in the cartoon, they always have a certain accent. What is that accent? Now, I want you to watch this. Okay, Clancy, take the boys and surround the house. Jeegus. Fellas, the cops. Open up. This is the police. All right, Rabbit, where's Rocky? Where is he hiding? He's not in this stove. Oh, he's hiding in the stove, eh? Would I turn on the gas if he was in there? You might, Travis. You might. Well, would I throw a lighted match in there if he was in there? Oh, no, you don't take me with you. Don't play me with that story, rabbit. I confess. I did it. I did it. Harass me. Arrest me. So you guys get it. So why do you think that the cops in Bugs Bunny cartoons have irish accents? See, you thought this class was going to be a waste of time, but I'm going to tell you why. And the reason why was because there was immigration to the United States. And when immigrants came to the United States, like, for example, if you were an irish immigrant, you would go to an american city like Boston or New York or someplace like that, and there'd be sections of the city that were kind of divided off by country. Of origin. So there'd be an irish section and there'd be an italian section, there'd be a jewish section, that sort of thing, right? And if you were irish, you came to America and you came to a city and you're in the irish section of the city and you're looking for a job. Where you're going to find a job is you're going to go down to the hiring hall. There's a place called the hiring hall. And there's a guy that runs the hiring hall, and we call him the boss. It's not bowser from Super Mario Brothers. It's actually a machine boss or political boss. And this political boss controls government jobs, right? So the reason why he's able to control the government jobs is because he's able to organize the voters in his district to vote for whoever is police commissioner. So basically what happens then is you go down to the boss at the hiring hall and you say, okay, I want a job. He says, okay, you can be a cop. Because the irish job was cops, right? So you can be a cop, and for 364 days a year you would be a policeman. But on election day, your job was to make sure that everybody got out and voted early and often to make sure your guy stayed in office, because if your guy stayed in office, then you could keep your job. So you job as a government favor in return for political favor in return for the political support, which is the votes. And really the way that it happens is that the boss is able to deliver the vote, so he gets to be the one who gives out the job. So now that's going to be a good system if you want people to be loyal to who's ever in office, because whoever is in office is the one who gives you your job. Right. But there's going to be a downside to it, too. What do you think that is? If you want to make sure that you stay the boss, how are you going to do that? Well, one way is to organize the vote, right? So, like, you could say with 147% of the vote counted, we have a winner, right? The other way would be to maybe skid grease the skids for the guy who's in office, right? What would we call that? Bribery. Okay, so. So that means that american politics is inherently corrupt. American politics is inherently corrupt because it's driven by influence and money rather than the free democratic spirit that was envisioned by the founders. You guys get what I'm saying here, right? Okay, so the question then about patronage is going to be, should we keep it and keep our government corrupt, or should we get rid of it? And if we did get rid of it, then how would we give out government jobs? And the answer's gonna be by civil service reform, essentially going from the patronage system where you give out jobs for support, like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, or in the cities, rather than having whoever shows up at the hiring hall and delivering the votes, getting the job. It's somebody who's actually been trained to be the policeman. And then when the government changes, you don't get a whole new set of policemen. Government stability. So the question then is going to be between this corruption that's represented in patronage and it's on every level of american government, or is it? Are we going to have civil service reform? All right. Okay. The next one. Money. The United States for the era going into the civil war was, had its economy based on the gold standard. The reason why was because the British were on the gold standard and the Americans wanted to be in competition with the British. So if that, if they were going to compete with Britain, they had to be on the same standard. And so they adopted the gold standard. And what the gold standard means is that for every dollar in circulation, there is a dollar's worth of gold in the treasury. Okay, so. So the. The dollar is actually a representation of specie. The word that. The word they call it is specie. Right? So $1 bill is worth one dollar's worth of specie. And the specie is gold. All right, so $1 bill is equal to one dollar's worth of gold. All right, I. Now, during the civil war, what happens is that the United States goes off the gold standard. And the reason why is because they needed more money to buy uniforms and things like that. So they wanted more money in circulation. And by putting more money in circulation, they were able to do all the things that they said they were going to do. The problem is that as you put more and more money into circulation, but you have the same amount of specie, what happens to the money? Decreases in value. It decreases in value. And we call that what? Inflation. Right. Inflation. Exactly. Right. So now I'm going to give you some numbers here just to imagine it's not the real number, right? But let's say that during this, I mean, we do see inflation. Right. And let's say that during the civil war. At the beginning of the civil war, $1 was worth $1 in current in specie, right? But by the end of the civil war, $1 was only worth $0.10 in specie, or the other way around, that it took $10 to get one to represent $1 worth of specie. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay? Now, after the civil war, a lot of people wanted to go directly back to the gold standard. And the reason why was because they wanted, again, to be able to compete with the British. Okay? The problem was that if you went, let's say that at the end of the civil war, the United States said, okay, now we're going to go right back to one dollars worth of currency is equal to a dollar's worth of gold. That would mean that in reality, you would, you would. It would take $10 for $1. You get what I'm saying? So let's say that at the beginning of the civil war, you borrowed $100, and at the end of the civil war, you had to pay it back. But they went back to the gold standard, you'd have to pay back $1,000. Okay, so that's a problem. All right. And who's going to be a problem for? Well, it's going to be a big problem for farmers, right? Because the way farming works is you, at the beginning of the growing season, you borrow money, and then you buy seed and whatever equipment you need, and you support yourself through the growing season. And in the harvest time, you harvest your crops, you take them down to the railroad and you sell them. And when you sell the crops, you get the money that you sold it for, you pay back the loan from the beginning of the year, and then whatever's left over is your profit. Okay? So if you borrowed a beginning of the year and all of a sudden at the end of the year, you owed $1,000, that's a big problem, isn't it? All right, so then we think about, well, the money issue then is going to be, should we stay on what they call the greenbacks, or in your book, it's called soft money, or should we go, or should we go back to the gold standard? And we'll talk more about that in a second. All right. Okay. The next one. The tariff is a big issue. It's always been a big issue in american politics. And the reason why is because America had two different economies, right? It had, it had an industrial economy and it had an agrarian economy. Okay? This was one of the major causes of the civil war because the north wanted to raise tariffs. Tariffs are a tax on imports, right? So the commercial interest, the industrial interests wanted to raise tariffs because that made their products more competitive. You can look at, at the beginning, say, at the beginning of the national republic. At the time the constitution went into effect, the situation was that you could actually buy better quality goods from England than american because the English were better at industrialization. They had already industrialized to a certain extent and Americans hadn't. So american manufacturers couldn't compete with the British. So what they wanted to do was they wanted to raise the tariff so that the British, the british goods would cost more and that would put them in competition with Americans who would give a product that cost less what maybe wasn't as good, but it cost a lot less. So tariffs are going to be good for industry because it protects them. It gives them an advantage over foreign competition. All right? And that is something that Americans enact and it really works for the United States. The United States does become a great industrial power because of that, right? It surpasses Britain and every other power by the beginning of the 20th century. Okay? But it's going to have a harmful effect on the south because the south, its major source of income is export agriculture. And that means that the countries that are importing America's exports are going to, are going to respond to the Americans raising tariffs by raising their own tariffs. And that means that when the american cotton growers sell their goods in Britain, they're not going to get as much money for it as they otherwise would. Right? So the tariffs are going to be, they're going to be harmful to the american plantation owners because they don't get as much money. And in going even further than that, that because they are in export agriculture, they don't, they don't manufacture things. And that means that anything that's manufactured that they need, they have to import. And when they, those things that they import, they're having to pay higher. They're having to pay more for, because they have to pay these tariffs. So, so it's a double whammy for the south, okay? It's good for the north, but it's a double whammy for the south, okay? And so the question is going to be, it's a perennial question, really. Should we have high tariffs and protect american industry or should we have low tariffs and protect american agriculture? The main thing is to understand the tariffs essentially are supposed to be good for industry and they're not good for agriculture. And in the beginning, the tariffs that Americans raised before the civil war actually did protect american industry. So it was actually a win at that point.",212

","There was an incident that happened in Virginia in 1676, right? And the incident was called Bacon's rebellion. I don't know if anybody has ever heard of Bacon rebellion, but you probably think, well, if it's Bacon rebellion, it's got to be good because it's got bacon, right? But that's not what it was about. It was actually, there was a guy named Bacon. His name was Nathaniel Bacon. And he was kind of a. He was not an upper crust elite in Virginia, but he was. Wasn't one of the most poor people either, right? And. But he had an idea that he wanted to get control of some of this land out here. But the leader, Governor Berkeley, had made a deal with the natives that they would not take away their land, they wouldn't encroach on their land as long as they didn't kill the settlers, right? So that was the deal. And Bacon thought that that deal was against the interests of the people of Virginia because they wanted to get that land, right? And so what happened was Nathaniel Bacon organized a rebellion against the governor and the elites. Okay? This rebellion, again, is called Bacon's rebellion. The interesting and significant part of this rebellion was that the rebellion was accomplished by bacon, but also by many poor blacks and poor whites. Okay? So poor blacks and poor whites work together to try to overturn the elite group in Virginia so that they could actually gain control of territory. You guys all want to say in here, now, what we really see here then is that there was nothing to prevent blacks and whites from working together. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay? And you may think, well, big deal. I mean, we work together with blacks and whites all the time, but not then, right? What we're going to find out is that by the time we get to say the time of the american revolution, the idea that blacks and whites could work together was completely out of question. That was not going to happen. There had been erected a wall of segregation, a racist wall, that said that black people were irredeemably inferior to white people. Okay? You guys follow what I'm saying? Okay, so let's keep going with this rebellion. What happens is that it goes on for a while. It's going to be put down. The elite are going to be able to put down the rebellion. Nathaniel Bacon dies of some disease, and many of the people who were actually partakers in the rebellion were executed. But the result of the rebellion was that the house of burgesses, the legislature in Jamestown, starts to pass laws that restrict the whites of blacks. Right? Eventually, they're called the black codes. And eventually, what will end up happening is that the law will say in Virginia and in later in other places in the south that if you are black, you cannot be free. Okay. If you are black, you must be a slave. There cannot be any free blacks in Virginia. You get what I'm saying? But these. And then they were restricted even before that, they were restricted from what kind of work they could do. Could they, could they testify in court and things like that? Right. Now, what, all these rules that were made against black people or that affected black people did not apply to white people. Right. So what effect do you think that is going to have on relations between blacks and whites? Negative correlation. It's just going to go the opposite. Meaning what? The whites will think the blacks are inferior and the blacks will grow to hate the whites. Exactly. All right. And why do you think that the Virginia legislature passed these laws? Why do you think they passed laws like that? If the poor whites are working against the poor blacks and vice versa, then they can't be working against who? In government? The elite. Right. And so what happens is you divide these people based on an external sign, which is skin color. Right. And then you cement that in law, and that means that the whites are going to start to think of themselves as the same as the elite and different from the blacks, even though they're on the same level economically and in terms of rights, even to some extent. Okay. So as long as the blacks and whites are at each other's throats, then the elite can do whatever they want. And this is going to be the beginning of race segregation in America. It's interesting that I didn't actually know this for a long period of time. And I don't think most people know that race ism in America can be traced to this kind of a kind of economic power move on the part of plantation elites. Yeah, I feel like, yeah, it's really easy to see how that has still, like, persisted to today. Like, a lot of, from my perspective, a lot of racism exists in lower economic classes. Yeah. Could be wrong. Did you guys see that in the movie, in the video where they talked about, I mean, if you look in the United States, for example, we had a black president. We had a black secretary of state. Even in the Trump administration, we had a black secretary of education for housing or whatever it was. I remember. Right. You guys get what I'm saying? Right? So the upper crust is actually well integrated. Okay. We have black people on the supreme Court. Okay? But the lower classes are the ones who are still at each other's throats. All right, you get what I'm saying? Why do you think it's important for them to stay at. For the elites to keep the lower classes at each other's throats so that they. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Kelly just said to keep them from rebelling. Well, yeah, rebelling against them. Right. Money and power, it gives them. Gives them the opportunity to hold on to their authority. Their privilege, I guess, is a better way to say it. Okay. And then just. And I know this is going to make some of you very hot and angry, right? But this is where we can still see white privilege today, right? Because whites have the situation. The social situation of a white person in America is not the same as the social situation of a black person in America. And the reason why white people have a hard time seeing that is because they're the privileged ones. Right. If you have privilege, you don't know you have privilege, but if you don't have privilege, then you can recognize it when somebody else does. So just kind of keep it there for now. And, you know, don't drop the class or anything because we'll, we'll look a little bit further into that later, okay?",213

","All right. So now let's talk about political parties. There was two political parties. We'll talk about them here in a second. I want to give you an overview first, though. And what I want, when I say an overview, what I mean to say is that there's Republicans and Democrats, but the Republicans and the Democrats are both split. Right. Okay. So the Republicans, there's two groups of Republicans. They're called stalwarts and mugwoms. Right. Stalwarts are people who are, who are kind of rigid ideologically to the party standard, which we'll talk about what that means here in a minute. Right. Mugwumps are people who are more willing to compromise. All right. The word mugwump actually comes from a native language. I'm not sure which one or even what it means, but the way that they used it was that a person who was a mugwump had his mug on one side of the fence and his wump on the other. Right. So, so that's american politics for you. But at any rate, the point is that they're kind of in the middle or they're not really tied to any specific ideology. Right. The Dem, the Democrats were split between the southern Democrats, who were more, I would say that they're more invested in white supremacy. What you'll notice is that the people that were in control of the south, the Democrats that were in control of the south after the civil war were essentially the same people that were in control of the south before the civil war. What we see then is that this ideology of white supremacy continues in the south and it's represented in the democratic party there. But we'll also notice that the democratic party in other parts of the country is going to become the party of immigrants and the party of labor, party of manufacturers, like, for example, in Los Maneros. If we were to conjecture the union members, would they be Republican or Democrat? They would be Democrat. Right. Okay. So that's the split then in the democratic party. And then there's a number of third parties because a lot of people, as I mentioned, this is an era of social unrest. And so the third parties are going to, are going to be representing kind of the major issues that we've been kind of talking about, one we really didn't talk about yet. We'll talk more on Wednesday, prohibition, which means we should stop people from drinking. And that's going to be a policy of the progressives. And we'll see why on Wednesday the Greenback party is going to be in favor of soft money, keeping a lot of money and a lot of currency in the economy. And then the populist party will be the party essentially, of the people, of the agrarian interests. And we're going to talk more about that here in just a few minutes. Now, I want to make an observation about the party system. And the reason why is because there is a misunderstanding or maybe even disinformation coming from certain groups in the United States who will make judgments about the current political situation based on the policies of the republican and democratic parties in the middle of the 19th century, say at around the time of the civil war. Right. So now, before the Civil War, there were actually two parties, but again, they were divided, okay? They were the Democrats and the Whigs. Right. But the Whigs are divided between northern and southern Whigs and the Democrats are divided between northern and southern Democrats. Okay? And what happens is that the Whig party essentially falls apart because its major platform was that they didnt like Andrew Jackson. So by the time we get to 1850s Andrew Jackson, instead, theres really nothing holding them together, right. And so it really dissolves. And instead, what happens is a bunch of people get together and form a new party, which they call the Republican Party as the GOP, the grand old party of Lincoln. Right. Or actually the grand old party of Jefferson is what it was. But at any rate, the point here is that this party was made up of northern Whigs and other groups like New York Free Soilers and a few other other groups, essentially inheriting the politics of the old federalists from the northeast who were in favor of commerce and big business, but also the free soilers who were in favor of restricting the expansion of slavery. Right. So what we really see then is a party that's based on economically, that's based on the interests of big business, but socially is a very liberal party, right. Because the idea of restricting slavery or abolishing slavery was unthinkable, really, to many people at that time. Right. So the idea here then is that the republican party is the party of big business, and it was also the socially liberal party. And then the democratic party started as the party of Andrew Jackson, the first populist president. Right. Is the People's Party, but it's also socially conservative, more in line with what we would think of as traditional values and that sort of thing. Right? So if we look at the Democrats and the Republicans during the civil war, again, you see Republicans are the party of big business and also socially liberal, really radical. And the Democrats are the party of the people, but also socially conservative. Okay? Now what happens is and we'll talk a little bit more about this next week and as we go on. Right. One of the things that happens as a result of what we're talking about today is there's going to be a new kind of, well, it actually will be a party. There'll be a party called the Populist Party, which is going to be the party of the farmers, but eventually it will transform into the Progressive Party, which is a party of reform. Right. And then that party will kind of decline, but the policies of the progressive party will be adopted by the Democratic Party. Right. So by the time we get to the election of 1912, the party, the Republican Party is now the party of big, is still the party of big business, but they've become more socially conservative. They've abandoned the progressives. The Progressive Party was Theodore Roosevelt, who was a Republican, but they've abandoned that aspect, and they're more focused now on the economic conservatism. And the Democratic Party, led by Woodrow Wilson, will still be the party of the people of labor and, and immigrants and that sort of thing. But now they'll also become the socially liberal party. Right. So we'll see then that the Republicans are the party of big business, have always been the party of big business, but they were the liberal party and have become the conservative party. And the Democrats have always been the party of the people, but they were conservative and have become more liberal. Now, the reason why I say that is because if you listen to the radio, which I don't, but if you did, right, or you look at your memes on Facebook or whatever, it'll tell you. Oh, well, it was the Republicans that freed the slaves and the Democrats were the slave holders. Well, yeah, that's true. Right. We're talking about Republicans and Democrats in 1860. We're not talking about Republicans and Democrats in 2021. So if your argument is that the republican party is the party of civil rights because of the 1860s, you're really making a historical mistake. Not really talking about history as it really happened. And we need to know that. We need to know that, yeah, the Democrats were the party of white supremacy. Right? But now they're, they're not. Okay? That doesn't mean that no Democrats are white supremacists or that all Republicans are. In fact, there's a group, the people, who were in control of the south before the civil war. The Democrats actually took control of the south after the civil war, and they continued their ideology of white supremacy. Okay, so then going into the 20th century, we see that these southern Democrats as the rest of the democratic becomes more progressive, the southern Democrats are going to become more disaffected. Right. So in the 1940s and fifties and sixties, the Democratic Party will become the party of civil rights, and that will alienate these southerners, democratic southerners who are the party of white supremacy, as we hear George Wallace, segregation now, segregation forever. And what happens is that as they become disaffected with the Democratic Party, they will go to the Republican Party. Right? So that's why if we look at the south today, it's almost all republican. Well, it's not because they favor big business so much as the fact that they were alienated from the Democratic Party by the civil rights stance and that Richard Nixon actually appealed to them at what was, what was called the southern strategy to get them to vote for him because he dog whistled, essentially saying that, you know, I'm on your side at basically appealing to the voters that supported George Wallace, the southern segregationist. So the history of the party system is a lot more complex than just, you know, the Republicans now are the same as the Republicans then and same with the Democrats. Right. It's a complex transition that happens over time. Right?",213

","I was raised that slavery was a certain thing, that the way it was in, say, Alabama or Mississippi or Virginia, whatever, that was slavery. And then I assumed that that's the way slavery was everywhere. But that's not the truth, right? What really ends up happening is that the United States actually develops the world's only self propagating slave population, meaning that the only place where slave populations actually grow without adding new slaves is in the United States. We have basically two different perceptions of race in the Americas, okay? And one of them, the one that we. That we know about, the one in America, is basically binary. And what that means is you're either black or white. The other one is more of a spectrum. So basically, in a binary system, you're either black or you're white. And what determines whether you're black is what, one drop of black blood. Basically, if you have any ancestors or have descended from any african people of african descent, you're automatically black. Right? Okay. Now let's think about this for a minute. Let's say that even if it was possible for there to be such a thing as black blood, do you think it's possible? Do you think there's such a thing as black blood? Do you think there's such a thing as irish blood, english blood, jewish blood? No. Blood is chemistry. There isn't any innate characteristic of blood that goes along with ethnicity or geographical origin. So there isn't any such thing as black blood. But even if there was, right, then how would you know if somebody had one drop, lay it out all on the floor, cut them open, lay all their blood out on the floor and say, well, there's one. I see one. There's a black drop right there. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? It's a silly notion. Okay? Now, what they really did really wasn't, you know, actually a measurement of blood. It was actually by vision, okay? And that causes some problems because. Because of the miscegenation in the south where the blacks and whites would procreate, often because the owners were trying to create more slaves, but that led to a whitening of certain offspring so that a certain white person could actually. Or a person who was. Had black ancestry could pass as white, and you wouldn't be able to tell. Right? But anyway, so that point here then, is that in North America, we have the binary system. And so the perception of race in North America is you're either black or you're white. And that if you are, well, I should say it this way, the only way that you can be the only way that you can have privilege is by being white. And then now, one of the things that we have to understand is that there's something. Now there's something called whiteness studies, because, really, the white race didn't exist before racism existed, and it really, really ends up being the most well defined in America, in the United States, okay? And the reason for that is because if you were to consider who actually had privilege in North America at the beginning of the United States, it wasn't only white people, but it was only certain white people, right? And those certain white people were Anglo Saxon Protestants, essentially, um, who were either from England or from somewhere in Scandinavia, okay? But there were no Catholics, there were no Jews, there were no, um, Irishmen or anybody else. They. They were not privileged. Okay? And even many people who were Anglo were not privileged. Right? As we'll talk about later. Okay, so. So then as time goes by, what we're going to see is that different groups come to America, and when they come to America, they're going to be excluded in very much the same way as black people are excluded. For example, I don't know if you guys know this, but we'll probably do a little bit of work on this later in the course, right. When the Irish came to America, many Irish came in the 1840s, but they were Catholic, and they spoke funny, right. And they were poor. Right? And so the. The idea of the people who were native call themselves native, who'd been born in America, right, who were of anglo saxon blood, as if there was such a thing, right? Would look at these Irish and say, well, look, they're just a bunch of drunks, and they're dirty, and they're Catholic, and they fight all the time, and they try to take our jobs away from us, right? Does that sound familiar? Right? And they're drinkers. They're all drunks. Right? All of that comes from antipathy toward irish immigrants, from the native lower class in America. But what we see happening is that these different groups, we could be the Irish, and then later on, it will be the German Catholics, and then it will be the Polish, eastern Europeans and Italians will come to America, and they will at first be excluded, but they will be able to work their way into whiteness so that eventually they will be recognized as white and have the privileges of being white. So when we talk about the way that these immigrants were treated when they came to America, they were treated as badly as race, as racism, but it wasn't really racism because there was this idea that they could actually grow out of it, that they. That they weren't irredeemable, that they could become equal. But black people could never become equal. And other groups, Asians, Asians could never become equal. Some people think Middle Easterners can't become equal because why? Because there's some deficiency in their blood. And that's why today, you see people who claim that people from the Middle east, people from Latin America, people from Africa, are going to ruin our country. People from Asia are going to ruin our country because they're not capable of democracy. That's where that comes from. That's where that idea all comes from. Okay? So the way that we're going to say it then, is that in North America, the concept of race eventually essentially evolves to whiteness equals privilege. If you're white, you have privilege. If you're not white, you do not have privilege. Right? But whiteness itself is a kind of a fluid concept, okay? Now, in the rest of the Americas, because they have a significant third population, like they did in Brazil, for example, or Mexico or Cuba, whatever, right? Because in those places, there were not just black and white, but there was another group of Indians, right? So we had the whites and the Indians and the blacks. All right? Okay. So now, the privilege actually was still oriented towards whiteness, but it wasn't binary, meaning that the closer to white you were, the more privilege you could have. Okay? And so there were actually levels. They had names of these in Mexico. They called them castas, right? And I'm going to give you guys an extra credit on costas, because there were actually paintings that they did in Mexico that would show, you know, what was the shade of the skin. Right? And then what kind of privileges they had. Okay? And so then that's where we see this. This kind of hierarchy of race, okay? But the problem, I shouldn't say a problem, I guess one other difference is that if you're in America, if you're black, you're always going to be black. You can never become white. Okay? It's impossible. Okay? But if you are in this society, you can live somewhere between no privilege and privilege. All right? So let's say the mixture of whites and indios is mestizos, and the mixture between whites and. Oops, sorry, the mixture between whites and blacks is mulattoes. And then the difference between indian black zambos or castas. But the point here is that you could fall somewhere in between here. By your birth, if you had, you know, a completely white father and a completely native mother, you would come out as a mestizo. Right. But you could actually pay to move up. Right? You could pay to move up to another level. You couldn't pay to become white, but you could pay to become closer to white. Why would you do that? Privileges. Exactly. You get more privilege. So what that tells us then, is that racism in Spanish America isn't quite the same as racism in North America. Because your race wasn't something that was hereditary. It was something that you could actually change. It was a social. It was a social construction, basically, that you could alter. Not that you could alter it completely. It was racist in the point that none of these people who were mixed race could ever become white. Okay? But they could move up and down in privilege. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. That's the difference between racism in North America and racism in the rest of the Americas. It's a very different way of experiencing race. But the one thing that we don't want to think about is which one is better? Neither. Why not? Why isn't this one better? In this one, I can actually move up if I want to. Can't go all the way. But unless I can move up. Right? But in this one, I cannot move up at all. I never can move up. Right. So why isn't this one better than that one? Because people are still being mistreated based on the color of their skin. Exactly. So it's not better. Neither one of them is better than the other. It's just different. Okay? Now, there's one other. There's one other aspect of this, and this is where we talked about earlier, how the United States develops the only self propagating slave population, okay? And that's the reason for that is because in. In the rest of the Americas, right, say Cuba or Brazil, right, slaves did not reproduce. And so what would happen would be. I mean, they did, but not at any significant rate, okay? Because they were just being worked too hard and they couldn't. They just didn't have the whatever, right? But anyway, the point here is that what would happen would be if you were a slave in Spanish America, you would be forced to work and you without any kind of support at all. No rest, and you would be able to last usually about six years. At the end of six years, you could no longer work. And so you were of no value to the slave owner. So the slave owner would free you. Right? But he wasn't freeing you so that you could go live happily ever after. He was freeing you because he didn't have to feed you anymore, right? And you would just go off somewhere and die. You guys get it? Okay, so in North America, because slaves were harder to get, more expensive, and then after 1807, the slave trade in the United States was illegal, right? And that meant that if you were going to. If you were going to keep your slaves, you had to produce. If you were going to have slaves, you needed to produce more, right? And so what ends up happening is that in North America, there is a push or movement toward slavery production, and the slaves are treated like animals rather than like machines, right? Meaning they're treated like livestock, okay? You can, you can breed them and you can get more that way, but you want to get as much value out of them as possible. So you will, you will not, you will not essentially work them to the point that they can't survive. And so slaves could live longer lives in North America, right? But they could never become free because there was no. The owner had no reason to free them. So in North America, slaves are treated more like livestock, and in the rest of the Americas, they're treated like machines. In our day, if you buy a car that lasts about ten years, and after about ten years, it doesn't work anymore, so you get rid of it and you buy a new one. You can't do that in North America. So instead, what you do is you treat it like a horse or like anything that you're growing, that you're using, that can bring you value over a longer period of time that's hard to replace. All right, so there's the difference between slavery in the Americas and slavery in the rest, between slavery in North America and the rest of the Americas. When we think about slavery in North America, I think we have a real tendency in the United States to think of it as a kind of a unique situation in the United States that nobody else in the world had any problem with race and racism. But if we look at this race and slavery situation in other areas, that gives us a broader perspective. It doesn't make what we know wrong, but it makes it more, um, it makes us able to differentiate better.",214

","Let's think about the issues and let's think about the parties and think about who's in favor of what. Okay, I'm going to go up instead of down. And the reason why. You'll see why in a minute. Right. But, so the tariff. What's the purpose of the tariff again? Protective. Protective tariffs. Who benefits from it? The north. Like the industrial. Industrial interest. Right. Okay, so who's going to be in favor of higher tariffs? Republicans or Democrats? Republicans. Republicans. Exactly. Democrats are going to be against it because they're farmers. Right. Or they represent the farmers. Okay. Money. The money issue. The hard money, the green, the gold standard. Who does the gold standard actually help? Hard money. It would be like the banks or like whoever issued the money that would. They would favor them the most. Right. The hard money represents commercial interests and. And industrial interests. Right. And who. Which party would be in favor then, of hard money? The green, the gold standard? The Republican. Republican Party. Exactly. Okay. And then Democrats would be against it. Now, what about the patronage issue? Who does that actually? Who does that actually help, Democrats or Republicans? Would it be both? Yeah, it's both. Right. See, that's the thing. The patronage. This is why I saved it for last. Because the patronage actually helps both parties. Right. Because both parties can make deals for political favors. Right. So what's going to happen is that patronage or civil service reform will not be an issue either of the republican or the democratic parties. It will be a progressive issue. The progressives are going to be the ones who are going to fight for civil service reform. And then. And then eventually what that will do is it will take power out of the hands of the old. Of the old bosses, whether they're at the top or closer to the bottom. So it's actually not a Republican Democrat issue. It's actually an issue of progressivism or traditionalism, I guess you could say. Right. I played the song about the wizard of Oz at the beginning of the course, at the beginning of the class. Here's the reason why. It actually is a good song. I kind of like it. Right. But the wizard of Oz has been considered a kind of a metaphor for this era in american politics that we're talking about. Right. So it's the. Again, the gilded age is an age of rapid economic growth, a shift from agriculture to industry, and massive income inequality. Right. Which leads to a lot of social unrest. And so the story of the wizard of Oz, the characters in the wizard of Oz is going to encapsulate those issues in american politics. Now, whether or not the author actually intended. That is, we don't really know that, but what we do know is that we can make a good connection between the wizard of Oz and the progress and the gilded age or the progressive era. Right? So if we look in at the characters, the scarecrow is going to represent the farmers, the Tin man, and is going to represent industrial workers. The cowardly lion is William Jennings Bryan. I'm sure you guys have read about him in your textbook. And he's also going to be. We're going to see him again in the class in a couple of weeks. Right? Dorothy is going to represent the populist party. Talk more about why in just a second. And then the wicked witches are going to be industrialists. The wicked witch of the east is eastern industrialists, and the wicked witch of the west is railroads. Then the Emerald city is Washington, DC, for obvious reasons. Right, because it's green. And the wizard will be President McKinley. All right. Okay. So then the big question that we're left with is, well, who does Toto represent? I want to. I want to leave this part behind and we'll talk more about this. But continuing our story about the period of time that we're living in, this movement towards industrialization is going to have a catastrophic effect. Farming in America. Okay? And here's the reason why. Because farming is going to become more industrialized, meaning that corporations are going to be able to grow food. That makes it. That makes it possible for the prices to fall. Okay? And so what will happen to the individual farmer will be that he will go, say he goes at the beginning of the season and borrows money and he grows these crops, and at the end of the season, he tries to sell his crops to the railroad to take to market, and he can't get as much money as he actually borrowed because the prices have fallen. So the next year, so he goes into debt and the next year he borrows more money and he actually buys more seed and he produces more crops with the idea that, well, if I didn't make any money last year, I'm going to need to make this much stuff to make it money. So he'll take his crops to market, but because there's more of them, the prices are going to be falling and he'll go deeper in debt. Right? So every year he grows more and more food and every year he goes deeper and deeper in debt until he finally will end up in bankruptcy. Right? The problem of the farmer really is driven by industrialization. And the response of the farmer is really going to be to try to stop industrialization, but that's not going to happen. The United States is an industrial country, and so family farming in the United States essentially will disappear. Okay? Now, that's not to say that there aren't any family farmers, but that individual farmers have been replaced by industrial farming. I mean, go out to the Imperial Valley and look what's going on out there. It's all big business. It's not, it's nothing. Single family farmers, it's all big business. Right? Okay, so essentially, even agriculture has become industrialized in the United States, and the family farmer will really disappear. Okay, but he's right in a way to think that the problem is in the industrial revolution. But that's not where he focuses his efforts. Where he focuses his efforts is going to be on the railroad, because he's going to see that every year he's going to make more and more stuff, and every year the railroad's going to change and charge more and more. Right. And he's going to think that the railroad's basically screwing him and that if he could regulate the railroad, then they would be able to make money. All right? The problem with that is that a railroad is an interstate entity. Right? Railroad doesn't just go from someplace in California to someplace in California. It goes from California to Chicago. Right. So what would happen if we were able to get the state government in California to regulate the railroad, which they were able to do. Actually, Illinois was the first. Right. But they could. What that would mean would be that state law would say that railroads can only charge so much to move goods in California. But what about when they got to Nevada? Right? Well, that would be under Nevada law. You follow me here? All right? And they can't control that. So the railroads could say, okay, well, we're going to charge you a dime to get it from Sacramento to the border and then $1,000 to get it into Nevada. You see what I'm saying? So regulating at the state level isn't going to help them. And what they end up doing then is they form a national party. And the national party, essentially, in the beginning is an anti industrial party, but it will become eventually a reform party. And the Reform party is going to be called the Progressive Party. It starts off as the populist party, and it is essentially the party of the farmers. Right? And these are going to be their. I'm sorry. These are going to be their, their platform, their, their issues. All right? And I'm going to go out of order again. Right. The first thing I want to talk about is the silver gold ratio. And this is going to be an answer to the money problem. Right. Okay. So what was the problem with money, again, from what was the two type. Two types of money? It was a gold and greenbacks. Right. Right. The gold standard and greenbacks. Right. And what was the problem? If we were actually on the greenbacks and some people wanted to go to the gold standard, why did they want to go to the gold standard? To make profit. Right. Because that puts them in competition with the british. Right. But what we saw happening was that if you went from a situation where the money was essentially floating, the amount of currency on the market was essentially floating to a situation where the money was actually tied to specie, which is gold, what's going to happen to the amount of money in the economy? The amount of currency that's actually in the economy is what goes down. It's smaller. Right. Yes. Okay. So one of the ideas that people will have is, well, what if we had more specie? Right. They can't buy more gold because there really isn't any more gold. Right. Most of the gold is already owned. So what they do is they suggest that we should buy silver at the rate of 16oz of silver is going to be equal to 1oz of gold. This is going to be called bimetallism. The idea would be then if we put silver into the treasury along with the gold, there can be more what? More currency. More currency, which theoretically will solve the problem, or at least one of the problems of going back on the gold standard. You follow what I'm saying? And this eventually will happen, that they will buy. The United States will buy up a lot of silver. Right. But I want you. I wanted to go. This one first was because we were just talking about the wizard of Oz. Right. And you guys know that in the wizard of Oz, Dorothy had a. Excuse me. Special pair of shoes. What were they made of? Slippers. Rubies. I'm sorry. Rubies. Right. Ruby slippers. Exactly. All right. But in the book, the slippers were silver. Right. So let's think about this for a second. You have silver slippers and you have. What kind of a road was she on? Yellow gold, yellow bricks. What do you think a yellow brick is? Gold. Right. So you see bimetallism there. Okay, he's got it. Anyway, so that's going to be one of the policies. The next one will be popular election of us senators. In the original constitution, senators were actually appointed by the states, not elected by the people. Actually, the states were left up to choose however they wanted. Right. But the result was that the Senate was full of people with money and influence. The Senate was called a millionaire's club by the time we get to the end of the 19th century. And the progressives, the populace, and then the progressives are going to say, well, we need to get those guys out of there because they're just protecting their own interests. Right. They're not protecting the interests of the people. Right. So then they're going to propose that the elect, the senators, should be elected by the people rather than appointed by the states. And then I'm going to go out of order again here. I'm going to talk about public ownership of railroads. Okay? So now the idea of public ownership of railroads is that the government would essentially buy the railroads from the railroad companies and operate them themselves. Right. Meaning that because the government is made up of the will of the people, right. That would mean that the people own the railroads. And so rather than have the railroads owned by private corporations, they'll be owned by everybody. All right. Now, there's a huge problem with that in the United States. What do you think that is? Basically what they're saying is we're not going to allow private ownership. Instead, the government's going to own everything. Or that means that everybody owns everything in common. So what does that mean? It's socialism, socialism, communism, the idea that private property is taken away. Okay, so socialism and communism are always going to be rejected by Americans. Americans don't like communism or socialism because the idea behind communism and socialism is that everybody shares everything in common, and that looks like a good idea. That's one of the reasons why communism actually came about in the 1840s, and why it was so popular in many places in the world was because it left lots of people without anything. And if the only time that actually sharing everything seems like a good idea is when you don't have anything. So, for example, if you have a car and I don't have a car, I think it would be great if you lent me your car. But if I have a car and you don't have a car, I think you should get your own car. You follow how that works? You would think then, because there are so many poor people in America because of the industrial revolution, but they would be in favor of socialism, but they're nothing. Not. And the reason why is because Americans always believe that they could be rich, right? There was a canadian scholar who explained that Americans socialism never became popular in America because America doesn't have any poor people. It only has temporarily displaced millionaires. And what that means is I might be poor now, but I might be rich later, and I don't want to give up my chance of owning things later. So I'm not going to be in favor of socialism. So essentially, the reason why Americans don't like socialism is because they like stuff. Everybody has stuff. Everybody wants more stuff, and they don't want to share it. So any rate, that's going to be the argument against public ownership of railroads, and that will never happen in the United States. The other one is similar to that graduated income tax. What that means is that the people who make more money pay a higher rate of taxes than the people who make less money. And some people don't pay any money. Right. Some people don't pay any tax because they don't make enough money to pay taxes. Right. So let's say now that I'm an adjunct professor and I don't make enough money to pay taxes, but then you compare me to somebody like Jeff Bezos. Right. Who makes, you know, tens of thousands of dollars an hour. Right. And the idea behind a graduated income tax is because Jeff Bezos has so much more money, he should pay more, and because I don't have any money, I should pay less. Does that seem like a good idea? That's how they were able to balance out of or at the time. Right. That's what they did to balance it out. Like they made the richer pay more in taxes and the poor pay less in taxes. Well, that's the way it is now. We do have a graduated income tax, but many people are against it. Why would people be against it? Because it takes away from. It could discourage people from wanting to work harder in the future. Because that's true. But most people, I mean, even people who I know who are staunch capitalists will say it's better to make money and pay taxes. Thank you. Right. But. But that's not really the issue here. The issue is you have to think about what are the taxes used for? In theory? Public works. Public works. Right. So taxes. The government raises taxes with our consent in order to provide services that are good for the people. That's the idea. Right. Okay. So now what that means then, is that Jeff Bezos is paying $1,000 in taxes. I'm just making these numbers up. Right. And I'm not paying any. Right. But I get the same benefit as Jeff Bezos. Right. And so that means that Jeff Bezos. I'm actually. I'm actually benefiting from Jeff Bezos money. You see, I'm saying. And so Jeff Bezos is going to say, well, why should I pay for services for Doctor Cox? That doesn't make. Let him make. Let him pay for his own services. You follow what I'm saying here? So again, it's a matter of income distribution. It's a matter of. Or redistribution is better to say it, okay, that we take money from those who have and give it to those who don't have, right? But doesn't that sound like communism? From each according to his ability, to each according to his need, right? And do Americans like communism? And why not? Because we think we're going to be rich. Because we like stuff, right? We like stuff. I want, I have stuff. I want stuff and I don't want to share it with anybody else. Right? Now let me just mention to you, as I already said, that we have a graduated income tax in the United States. And let's think about the issue of socialism again. We'll bring this up again more later in the course, right? But if we think about the issue of socialism, Americans tend to think of free market, laissez faire versus socialism share everything. And there's a hard line between them. But in reality there really is no such thing as a free market or laissez faire. The government always has its hands on the economy. And the way that they do that, and one way that they do that is by raising taxes. We all pay taxes. I mean, even if you don't pay income tax, you pay tax at the 711. So we all pay taxes. And so what we see then is that there is a kind of an element of socialism built into the system that claims to be capitalist, right? For example, let's say that we all pay taxes, but I pay much less taxes than so and so does. And yet the taxes are used to build a road and I get to use the road just like the other guy. Right? So I'm getting benefit from something that I didn't pay for, essentially, and that's income redistribution, okay? Or we can talk about the military. The military doesn't just defend the people that pay the most taxes, defends everybody, right? And the fire department, all these different things, right? So there is an element then that could be labeled socialism and that a lot of people will label socialism. You listen to a hardline economic republican, they would say, well, we don't wanna have the government do anything. Let's privatize everything, right. And not have the government do anything. Right? But most of those people are well outside the mainstream. Cause everybody wants the services everybody wants the roads. Everybody wants, you know, to be safe from invasion and things like that, right? So we allow that as even in a capitalist system, right? So even though we live in a capitalist system, there is an element of socialism and the act. And the, and the argument never really is, should we have socialism or not? Or should we have government control of the economy or nothing. The question is how much, how much control should there be? Should the government have very little control like the Republicans would want, or should the government have much more control like many of the Democrats would want? And that's what we argue about. That's the center of the focus of american politics. It's not over whether or not the United States government should be involved, but how much should it be involved? So when people will point to, well, like I said, the idea of, let's say, for example, welfare, people will look at welfare and say, okay, well, this person is not working and I'm paying for them to have food and shelter, right? So that's taking money from me to support them. That's not fair. Okay? But then at the same time, we see the government taking less money from corporations and supporting itself with people. With money from people who don't make as much. Right. Certain, like, for example, certain industries don't pay any tax at all, but we still, they still get the benefit of american law. So isn't that socialism, too? So there's this idea of everything that I don't like is socialist, is really just smoke. It's not real. Okay. It's not the reality of american politics.",214

","So if we were to say, what kind of a society developed in the tidewater region, we would say, well, it was very similar to the medieval society in Europe. It was aristocratic, it was stratified, and it was agrarian. Now, we're going to look at New England, and what I want you guys to remember, we talked about Henry VIII starting the English Reformation. He really didn't change the church very much. That was different from the Reformation that was happening on the continent of Europe. On the continent of Europe. The reformation is about doctrinal changes in the church, and they formed new churches that were doctrinally different or actually reformed from the Catholic Church. And some of the aspects of these churches were that position of the church in salvation wasn't thought of the same way. In the Catholic Church, you can't get salvation without the sacraments, and you have to get the sacraments from the church. But in the protestant religion, the church basically was just an assembly of believers, and they got their salvation directly from God. And that salvation, they got the faith for that salvation from being able to read the Bible. And that's why they were able to read the Bible. And so there were basically two different types. There were many, many, many different types, right. But the two main types that we're talking about here were the Lutherans and the Calvinists. The Calvinists were a little bit more, I guess you could say, radical than the Lutherans. The Lutherans were actually a little bit closer to the original catholic church. But Calvinism actually becomes popular in England, even though it's illegal, because everybody in England is supposed to be Catholic before Henry VIII and Anglican after that. But after Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church, even though he really didn't change the church, there were some people in England who thought, this is going to be a good opportunity to purify the church from within. What does that mean? Purify the church from within means to make it calvinist, essentially. And in England and Scotland, they will call it Presbyterian. The point here, though, is that there's this group of people who work with Henry VIII and with the fact that he broke away from Catholicism in order to try to implement these reforms in the church or to purify the church from within. And these people are called Puritans. Now, here's the thing. By the time we get to Elizabeth and James, these puritans are going to realize that they're not going to be able to purify the church from within. And so they basically moved to Holland and they practice their form of religion there. Holland is a much more tolerant society than England at that time. And while they're there, they ask for a charter from the king to find a place in America where they can practice their religion freely. And they actually do get a charter from the king, and he allows an expedition to go to America that basically is going to form a new colony in America. And the people who are forming this new colony are coming to America with the idea that they're going to found a model christian society. They come with the idea that they're going to build what John Winthrop is going to call a city on a hill. Now, a city on a hill is a Bible symbol, a model of perfection. A city on a hill is a place where everybody lives in peace and harmony with God and with each other. So when the people came to New England, their motivation was much different from the motivation of the people who settled Virginia. Why? What was different? The original settlers were there for economic reasons. Exactly. They went there to get rich. They were going to get 100 english gentlemen to conquer the great indian empire, and they were going to extract value just like the Spanish had done in new Spain. The problem, of course, with that was there was no great indian empire. But nevertheless, the whole project was about making money. But in New England, the project is about what? Establish a city on a hill, which is a model christian society. So in that sense, we would say that the colonization of New England was started by a missionary impulse. These Christians were on a mission to fulfill the New Testament idea of the city of God on earth. Their idea was that they were going to found this model christian society that proved to be so prosperous and so blessed that everybody in the world would want to live like them. And then they would. So they would voluntarily adopt this christian attitude that would give them this blessing of living in harmony with God. It was really very much like the idea of, I mean, if you know, biblical history, the idea was that the Jews were going to establish this holy city in what today is Israel, and they would create such a blessed society because they followed God's law that everybody in the world would come, come back to being subjects of God. So that really never happened. It didn't happen because there was corruption in the church. And now these puritans are saying, yeah, there's corruption in the church again, and we're going to do what they couldn't do. So we're essentially the new Israel. That's their idea. When they went to America, their charter was for land in this area, but they didn't make it there. They sailed off course. And instead, they ended up in what will become New England at a place called Plymouth, which is here. So it's way off course. So this is where they end up landing in 1620. You guys ever heard of a pilgrimage? A pilgrimage is when you go. When you make a journey to go someplace holy, right? Like, for example, islamic people have to make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in their lifetime. It's called the hajj. So a pilgrimage is a religious journey or kind of a missionary journey. So that means that the people that came to America on the Mayflower were called pilgrim, basically. Then what happens is they land in Plymouth, and then later, ten years later, there's going to be another. Another group that comes and lands and becomes Boston. So basically, the two ships are the. One of the Mayflower of the original settlers and the. The Massachusetts Bay Colony, what came from the ship Arbella, and it was led by a guy named John Winthrop. Okay. And here's the quote by John Winthrop. For we must consider that we shall be a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword through the world. So you can see in that quote, the idea or the missionary idea that they had, that they were there to build this model christian society.",221

","The big difference in motivation for colonization between Virginia and New England was what? The motivation in Virginia was economic. In a sense, we could say that the motivation in New England was ideology, because theology or religion is a kind of ideology. So we have one group of colonies that are formed based on ideology, and we have one group of colonies that are formed based on economic. Okay, let's go a step further. The geography of New England is very different from the geography of the tidewater region. First of all, it's much healthier, but also it's. It's heavily forested. There's. It's got rocky soil, so it's not suitable for plantation agriculture. Okay? They can't. They can't grow tobacco in New England or any other plantation crop. And instead, what they form are small farms, family farms. And the problem with their family farms is that these Protestants don't practice inheritance in the same way as Anglicans or Catholics, because, remember, we talked about basically, all the inheritance in Europe through the Middle Ages was based on primogeniture. But in New England, they have what's called partable inheritance. And what that is, is that every son gets a share in the inheritance. So it's not the first son inherits everything, and everybody else is on their own. It's all the sons inherit the farm equally. Let me try to draw you a little picture about this. Let's say we have an estate that is owned by a Catholic, and he has seven sons, and when he dies, only one inherits. And so what that does is it keeps the estate together. And this is one of the reasons why all the aristocracy in Europe intermarried, so that they could keep all their estates in the family. What Protestants did was they divided the estate into however many number of descendants you had. So let's say in the first generation, he has four sons. So that means that the farm gets divided up into four farms, and each son gets one farm. But then, let's say, in the next generation, they each have four sons. So that means in the next generation after that, every farm gets divided up into four more farms. And so eventually what's going to happen is it will reach a point where they cannot support the family. So what happens then is that the children of the settlers who can't inherit, but the farms, just too small to actually work, will look for other ways to make money. The problem here is if you are somebody in Massachusetts, let's say in, say, the 17th century or 18th century, and you're looking for some way to make money, because you can't use. You can't farm anymore. What do you think you're going to do? Here's the problem with moving west. There are very powerful indian nations in the west, and a lot of this land is actually claimed by France. So you could move west, but it wouldn't be an easy move. It wouldn't be like, you know, you could just move in and take over. So you can't farm. You can't really move. Some people do move, eventually they'll move, but. But for the most part, you're going to be looking for work. And where are you going to find work? Well, you find work in the cities. And so what ends up happening there develops two different economies. One was timber logging. The idea of logging was that you could cut down trees, and they could use them to build ships. They could use them as masts to build ships. So shipbuilding becomes a big industry and also commercial fishing. And Boston then becomes a center of trade. Okay, so Boston actually is really the focal point of the slave trade for much of the 18th century in the world, really, because the english slave trade basically was centered in Boston. So what we see developing in New England then is this industrializing economy.",222

","Now, we're going to say that the industrial revolution starts in 1767, I think, or something like that, with the foundation of a mill in England. But the movement towards industrialization started way earlier than that. It really started with the discovery of America. One of the things that's going to be significant about european history. Is that during this period of time, England is becoming more and more industrialized. Even though we won't say yet that it's an industrial economy. Right. But it's becoming more and more industrialized. And what we see happening is that the colonies in New England are following England's lead. So they're becoming more and more industrialized as well. When they're becoming more and more industrialized, they are at the same time becoming more modernized. Because the process of becoming a modern place included industrialization. It also included liberalization, which means, in some ways, popular sovereignty. And it includes capitalism. We've talked about that before. So we see that movement towards modernism in. In New England, but we don't see that movement toward modernism in Virginia. What we see in Virginia is essentially a backward looking society. I'm not saying it's a backward society. I'm saying it's a backward looking society. Meaning that it very much resembles the earlier period in Europe. More so than the modern period that England and now New England and other countries are moving toward. Is this really going to create two completely separate societies in America? And they are going to see each other as foreign. So people in Virginia will know about people in New England. But from their point of view, they're foreigners. And the people in New England will know about the people in Virginia. But from their point of view, they are foreigners, and they have two different cultures. This one's much more open and democratic. The Virginia culture is much more aristocratic, like medieval Europe. And they have two different economies. One that relies very much on trade and the other one that relies on agriculture. What do you think these differences in creation are going to result in? As I mentioned to you guys, that people in New England saw the people in Virginia as foreigners, and the people in Virginia saw the people in New England as foreigners. And they, both societies had very different needs. They had different outlooks, and they had different needs. What we'll see, I think, starting next week, is the people in the north and the people in the south will come together against a common. What they consider to be a common enemy, which is the British. And they'll form a country, but that country will be a country of separate countries. It's not going to be like what we think of today as the United States. When we think of the United States, we think of this great big country, capitals in Washington, and they have all these different places, like Ohio and California and Texas and Florida, but it's all one country. But in the original idea of America, of the United states of America, was that they were very different countries, and the only reason why they had a central government was to do things that they couldn't do for themselves, like foreign policy, for example. So then when we see these two regions of the country not really seeing each other as brothers, but as rivals, how do you think it's going to end? War. What kind of war? Civil war. The civil war. Exactly. So now, why did I bring all this up right now? The reason why is because I want you guys to know that the civil war was inevitable. It began, really, in the 17th century with the first colonies, because the United States was not created as a single place. It was created as a bunch of different places, particularly these two places. And one of the kind of themes that we'll see as we go through american history is that there's always two different outlooks on America, on every aspect of America, really at least two. So is America a great economic powerhouse? Yes. Is America a land of idealism that is exporting itself superior ideology? Yes. Is the United States a rapacious, imperial predator? Yes. Is the United States a fountain of liberty? Yes. So we need to keep in mind that the United States is always a diversity, even when all the people are white, the United States is always a diversity.",223

","When we talked about the second treatise on civil government, we went through that timeline, the english history timeline. And the reason why we went through that timeline was because we wanted to get a feel for why Locke was writing what he wrote when he wrote it. Does anybody remember what was the great issue of the time when Locke wrote that second treatise on civil government? Remember I said there were two major controversy in England during this period of time that we're talking about with. Starting with Henry VIII and ending with William and Mary. Was it the religions between the Protestants and the Catholics? Right, so that's one issue. And what was the other issue? Divine right. Well, it was. Yeah. So the divine right was the issue. Did Locke think that divine right was the way to go? Where did Locke think that sovereignty came from? From the people rather than from God? Now, when we get close to the end, we see James II on the throne, and he's very unpopular, and there was a rebellion against him led by his daughter and another. Her husband named William of Orange. And what was the name of that event? Do you guys remember? Okay, here's the chart. So what was the. What was the event that. Where James II's daughter, Mary and her husband, william of Orange, rebelled and acted against the king, James II? What was it called? The glorious revolution. The glorious revolution, exactly. Now, does anybody remember why it was glorious? Why they called it glorious? No one died. And because it's. It's no one. That. That's why they call it glorious, because nobody died. Right, but one of the things, and I think I may have mentioned this to you, but I'm not sure I did, is that when James II abdicated, meaning he fled England and he went to France, he didn't give up the throne. And so what happens next, then, is that for the next decades, Britain is going to be involved in internal conflict that will keep it from governing its empire. Okay, so this era is going to be called the era of benign neglect. And the reason why it's called benign neglect is because England, in theory, continues to rule over the empire, which means that England is responsible for the defense of the empire, which includes the american colonies. It also includes India and caribbean islands and other places. Right, but it includes the american colonies. So. So the american colonies are theoretically still under the protection of the british empire, of the. Of parliament, essentially, in the king. But the. The British are. So the British are so preoccupied with political turmoil at home that they really don't rule the colonies. And so what that means is that all of the colonies will essentially develop a tradition of ruling themselves. So this era of benign neglect will last from about 17, 1689, I should say, up until 1763. You should write that down. Right. And the reason why 1763 is because in 1763, there's going to be a conflict between Britain and France that will boil over into the american colonies. All right. So the main point that I want to make here, then, is that all of that turmoil that we were talking about in England is, in a way, going to prevent the English from governing their colonies in America. And the result is that Americans will develop a tradition of self government. When we think about that, when we would say, okay, well, it's kind of like there's the United States even before the revolution. But that would be wrong. And I, and I've mentioned to you before how people in the colonies in America don't see themselves as all being american. They see themselves as being, they know that they live in America, but their primary identification is with their colony. So if you, if you were, if you lived in Massachusetts, then your, your country is Massachusetts, and if you lived in Pennsylvania, then your countries, Pennsylvania and Virginia and these others, they're all like that, and then you could actually look at people living in these other colonies as foreigners. Right? So, I mean, this may sound ridiculous, but people in Massachusetts thought of people in Connecticut as foreigners. Right? It would be kind of like us in California thinking of people in Arizona as foreigners. You know, I mean, some of us maybe do, but it's not. We don't really think that way. We know that the people in Arizona are american, just like us. Right. But in these days, the identification would have been with your local colony and, and all the other colonies were foreign.",311

","The first thing we want to say, well, american imperialism. America doesn't have an empire, but America has essentially been imperialistic since the very beginning, even in the colonial period, because the definition that we're using for imperialism is that one country controls the resources of another country for its own economic benefit. All right? That's essentially what we mean by imperialism, and that's what drove imperialism in the 19th century. All of the industrial powers, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Japan, and the United States, will also become imperial powers driven by their industrial economies. Okay? So what we want to do, though, is when american imperialism is going to be a bit different from european imperialism for a couple of reasons. And so what we want to do is go all the way back to think about where do Americans actually start to be, or how does american. How do Americans conduct foreign policy? All right? And we go to understand that, we go all the way back to the Washington administration, and Washington, as you guys know, served two terms, and then he decided not to run again. Okay? And he set the precedent then for two terms in the presidency. But at the end of his presidency, he thought of himself kind of as an elected king. And the way that a king would have been thought of at that time, traditionally, was that the king was the father and the protector of the people. So when Washington retired from public office, he thought that it would be important for him to make. It would be important for him to leave his children with some advice. Right? And so that's where we come to Washington's farewell address. It wasn't a speech. It was actually a document that was written. It was actually written by Alexander. But the point here is that it says what Washington. The advice that Washington wanted to leave Americans when he retired and find the whole document line, it's not very long, it's very prescient, has a lot of really interesting things in it. And the two that are, we're really concerned about today is the way that Washington defined american foreign policy and american foreign policy. What we have to understand about America at the time of Washington's presidency or in the first years of the republic was that the United States was very weak and that the United States was in the presence of two very powerful, antagonistic powers in Europe who were at each other's throats. That was England and France. Right. England and France both wanted the United States to be on their side in the wars between them, and they really did a lot of interfering in american politics. But Washington, realizing that America was weak, decided that the United States should remain neutral, that United States should not pick sides, because his idea was that if the United States did pick sides and. And they picked the wrong side, that would be the end of America, because either the French or the British could have destroyed America. Okay? And so he says, we're going to stay out of Europe's affairs, but at the same time, Washington is going to say that we should insist on what he called unrestricted commercial ties or unrestricted free trade. And what that means is that we can trade with whoever we want to, right? And we're not going to be limited by european mercantilism. So if you guys remember, maybe you don't remember what mercantilism essentially was that the colonies could only trade with the mother country, right? And in the mother country could trade with other countries. But what the american system was the first. The first system, really, that relied on what they call free trade, we call unrestricted free trade, that any country could trade with any other country. So the United States insists on the. On the ability to trade with any country that it wants. So these are the two main pillars, I guess you could say, of american foreign policy. On one hand, we're not going to get involved in european affairs, and on the other hand, we're going to insist that we can trade with whoever we want. Okay? And sometimes those come into conflict. So, for example, the war of 1812 was about the British trying to keep the Americans from trading with the French. Okay? And the Americans insisted that they ought to be able to trade with the French. So the Americans went to war with the British. And we'll just leave it at that. America survived that. So that was an interesting episode. But at any rate, it was. It shows us that the two pillar, the two principles, actually sometimes go into conflict with each other. Okay? The thing about these principles is that they are going to remain almost as if it was law all the way up until, really world war one. Okay? The United States will remain a continental power all the way up until world war one, with very few exceptions. Okay? But in 1824, there was a crisis in the Americas, and the crisis was that all of the spanish american colonies were breaking away from Spain. And Americans had two interests in these new countries that were breaking away from Spain. One of them was that the United States saw common cause with these revolutionary movements in Spanish America, because many of them were actually inspired by the american revolution, right? So the Americans thought this was the. The progress of our revolution, that it goes, it's starting now, and it's going. It's going to eventually spread everywhere, this idea of liberty. Right? The liberty that I defined for you on a second day of the class, I think. Right. Liberty with an exclamation point. Okay? And so there's this ideological affinity between North Americans and Spanish Americans, all right? But then there's another interest, and that is in trade. Because when the spanish colonies become independent, then they can trade with whoever they want. But when they're actually colonies of a european power, they can't. They have to trade only with that european power. So Americans are going to be, are going to be very interested in maintaining the independence of spanish american countries because it helps them to maintain trading partners. Right? You guys get my saying? So what we see then is we have two really different interests in the United States maintaining the independence of spanish Americana countries. One of them is ideological and one of them is economic. Okay? And what we're going to notice is that american foreign policy will be characterized like american politics. American foreign policy will be characterized between. By that relationship between idealism and economics, right? So when it comes to foreign policy, the question is going to be, is the United States the beacon of freedom, liberty, justice and equality in the world, or is the United States a rapacious imperial predator? Right? And the answer to that question is going to be yes. Yes. The United States does believe in freedom, liberty, equality and justice, and they try to instill those principles in every place where they intervene. But at the same time, Americans want to make a lot of money, right, just like the rest of the imperial powers. Right? So the United States will act in the same way as many of the other industrial powers. Okay, so here's where the dilemma comes in for american foreign policy as compared to, say, for example, british foreign policy, right? So the british foreign policy is going to be the same, except that the British are, don't have this idea of spreading liberty, right? And the French and the Germans, they basically say, okay, we're here to get your stuff and they're pretty much upfront about it, right? But Americans don't do that. Americans go and say, okay, we're here to make you all free and Democrats, and at the same time we're going to take your stuff. Right? So it makes other people think that Americans are. American foreign policy is hypocritical. I mean, even Americans think that, all right, because we say, okay, well, you say that you stand for freedom, justice, liberty and equality in the world, but at the same time, you just come in and take our stuff like anybody else. Right? So you're really hypocritical. The truth is that american foreign policy isn't hypocritical. It's mentally unstable. It's a split personality. America has two personalities at once. And I think that's what makes american foreign policy so difficult for. For others to understand. But anyway, so the Monroe doctrine is going to say, okay, what happens is that Americans decide that they're going to impose their will on the Americas. And the way that they're going to do that is that they're going to declare this doctrine. Doctrine was declared in 1824 when President Monroe was president, right. And Monroe doctrine will say that the Americas are close to new colonization, no new colonies in the Americas. But the quid pro quo will be that we're not going to establish any colonies in Europe. Okay? So now, if you think about 1824, here's this little country on the east coast of the north american continent, right? Telling these great european powers to stay out. What do you think that those powers think about America's doctrine? They probably think it's ridiculous. They're like, how can you tell me what to do? Exactly. It's almost like if you think about this, kind of, one of the ways I've tried to imagine it is if you go to, if you went to the playground and you saw a sandbox there and there's a little three year old in the sandbox saying, my sandbox, stay out, right? And what would you do? You say, well, that's a little brat, right? Like, try to stop me, try to stop me, you know? Exactly. But. And in 1824, you know, they couldn't. Nobody took it serious in 1824, and. And there was no reason for them to. But United States, during the 19th century, is going to become incredibly powerful, right? So that by 1900, the United States really is the most powerful industrial country on earth, okay? And so when Americans said that they were going to enforce their will on the Americas, at first they couldn't, but then they could, right? And one of the, I think, the height, really, of this idea of american hegemony. This is the word. It's kind of like a. Its domination. American domination of the Americas comes in 1895, because there is a, there's a crisis that happens in South America, and I don't really have maps. I wish I did, but. But there's a crisis that happens in South America where there's. There's Venezuela and there's British Guiana, a colony of Britain. And the border between those two countries had always been fluid. Nobody had ever really fixed the border and nobody really wanted to because it was, you know, it wasn't country that was worth anything until somebody found gold there, right? And then all of a sudden, the Venezuelan will say, that's ours. It's always been ours, right? And the British say, no, no, it's not. It's ours. And they threatened to send troops to America. But what happens is Venezuela actually calls upon the United States to support them in their conflict with Britain. And the Americans will make a statement based on the Monroe doctrine, which is called the only corollary to the Monroe doctrine. And what that corollary says is that the United States is practically sovereign in the Americas and its fiat is law. Okay, so, so now let's think about what does that mean? What does practically sovereign mean? Sovereign means like to rule over something. Correct? Right, exactly. So. So that says the United States is practically sovereign. What does that mean, practically? Like, you know, almost there. Well, that's the way. That's one of the ways we think about it. But really, if you think about the word itself, it means in practice, right? It might not be official, but in practice it is. It's there. Right? So in practice, the United States is sovereign over all of the Americas. What does that mean? That means the United States rules, right? And to what extent does the United States rule? Its fiat is law. So what is a fiat? I know it's a little italian car, but that's not what they were talking about, right? The fiat comes from the word. It's a latin word. Okay. If you look at the logo or the motto of the University of California, Fiat Lux, let there be light. Right? So the idea, it comes from the biblical idea that God said something, and it was. So God said, let there be light, and there was light. That's a fiat, right? So if America says this is so, it's. So essentially the United States claims godlike power over the Americas. You guys get what I'm saying? So, so this is going to be american foreign policy in the Americas, that the United States will be. Will be. Will consider itself to be sovereign in the Americas, and that the United States really is unchallenged in that. Okay? The outcome of the Venezuela boundary crisis that I was just telling you about was that the British backed off. And the reason why wasn't because they were afraid of the Americans so much that they had interest in other parts of the world and didn't want to get bogged down in a conflict in the Americas. So what that really does, though, is seeds the Americas at the US sphere of influence.",311

","There's a conflict that, that is initiated between the French and the English, and most of this conflict happens in Europe, and it doesn't really happen in America until there's a clash in America that will eventually grow into a worldwide war. Okay. And the. The way that that works out is there's this. Well, first off, let me just mention, if you look at this map here, you'll see that the blue area is the british colonies, and the yellow area is the french colonies, the french colonies. The french empire in America is very different from the English because what happens in the english colonies is that people settle in these colonies and live there to start a new life, so to speak. Whereas people in the french colonies are generally. Are generally traders. So they don't really take over the land. They don't really start farms and stuff like that. What they do is they trade for goods, particularly furs. Right. So there's a difference in the perception of what the land is based on, whether you're French or English, because the English are looking at land as a livelihood, and the French are not really that concerned with the land as much as long as they can get their. Their trading goods. All right? But there is a sense that. There's a sense that there is a limit to the French and the english colonies, and there isn't any agreement on where that limit is, because when Americans got charters to settle these colonies in America, these colonies essentially started here on the atlantic coast, and in theory, they went as far west as you can go. So the idea would be then that, like, Pennsylvania goes all the way to California and Virginia goes all the way to California, although they didn't really know how extensive that was. There was a lot of this that wasn't really known at the time. The point here is that people in Pennsylvania, then, or in Virginia could say, well, we want this land, and the king gave it to us. And this land that I'm pointing to is the Ohio river valley. So this river that you see right here is the Ohio river. And what's significant about the Ohio river is that it's a very. It's very good for agriculture. Right. It's a very fertile land. And result of that is in that the english colonists, particularly in Pennsylvania and Virginia, want to move into this territory so that they can divide up the land and they can sell it. Okay, so. So I don't know how many you guys, you guys have heard of George Washington, right? Who's George Washington? Come on. Military commander and our first president. Our first president, exactly right. He's also the guy on the dollar bill. Okay. And does anybody know very much about him? Do you know what his first job was? He was a surveyor. What does a surveyor do? Marks. Marks out where property lines are, basically. Exactly. Marks out property lines. So what they did was there were expeditions that were sent from Virginia into this territory to survey the land, to mark it off. And why would they do that? Because they wanted to sell it. Right. So George Washington first job was to divide up this land so they could sell it, even though the ownership of the land was in question. Right. So then later, there's going to be these tensions between the French and the British over the dispute about this land is going to get worse. And George Washington actually will lead a contingent of the Virginia militia into what is today Pennsylvania. And there will be a battle here, just a really. A little skirmish, really, called the battle of Jumonville Glen. And in that battle, the french ambassador will be killed. All right, let me just go back here for a second and show you this painting here. This is actually a depiction of the battle where they, Virginia colonists, are sneaking up on the French, right? And the french ambassador gets killed. And that's going to cause the French to accuse Washington of assassinating their. Their envoy. Their ambassador. And that will. The tension that is caused by that will eventually escalate into a worldwide war between the British and the French, right? So this little skirmish that was started by George Washington ends up creating this worldwide war between the British and the French. And the war is being fought in Europe and in the Caribbean and in Asia and in South America. And the war actually is not going well for the British. Okay? And one of the reasons why is because the British really aren't spending a lot of attention on America. So one of the things that they do, the british parliament, will basically instruct the colonists to come together and to come up with a plan for opposing the French in North America, right? That's why this great war for empire is called, uh, in America, that's called the french and indian war, right? You guys have heard of that before? French and indian war. Right? That's because it's between the French and the Indians, right? Is it between the French and the Indians? Are we having a hard time waking up today? Come on, somebody tell me. Is it between the French and Indians? I don't. I don't think so. I don't quite remember. But I'm pretty sure it's not. It's not. You're right, Danny. Thanks for speaking up. It's actually the French and Indians on one side and the Americans on the other. Although in theory, it was the British. Right? So the. The French and the Indians on one side and the British on the other, and the. The parliament's telling the Americans, okay, I want. We want you to come up with your own plan to defend yourselves. And Americans come together in Albany, New York, and they come up with a plan for mutual defense. But it actually was something that the colonies were reluctant to fulfill, and eventually the parliament will reject the plan. But the main thing that comes out of this Albany plan is the idea that the colonies are so disunited that they can't really come together to defend themselves against the French. All right? And part of the reasons why is going to be because when you look, and I know this map is a little difficult to see, but most of the conflict is happening up here. So if you're down here, you don't want to get involved in that fight. It's got nothing to do with you. And this is far away, right? I mean, distances were just. These were incredible distances at that time. Okay, so the southern states are like, well, why should we come to the aid of the northern states or the northern colonies? They've got nothing to do with us. They're a bunch of foreigners. Right? Okay, so what happens then is that Britain will be forced to focus its attention on the north american colonies, and when they do that, it's going to turn the war in their favor. The. The British are going to be able to defeat the French in North America, which leads to an overall victory in this great war for empire. Another name for that war is the seven years War. It was called the seven Years War. Why do you think they call it the seven Years War? Maybe because it lasted seven years. Exactly. It lasted seven years. Right. So then you can see it started in 1756, and it ends in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris. And the outcome of the Treaty of Paris is that Britain gains all of this territory east of the Mississippi, with the exception of Florida, which becomes Spanish, and then all the territory west of the Mississippi is ceded to the Spanish. So the French lose their entire empire in North America through this war. And the French aren't going to forget this. The French are going to be very unhappy about having lost this major battle, this major conflict to the British and lost their empire in America.",312
47,"US2: 312 -US2: 312
","Okay, so now you guys will recall that we talked about the 1890. The frontier was closed. What does that mean? Remember we talked about that 1890 frontier was closed. There's nowhere else to go. We had nowhere else to go. And what was that going to do to american life, the fact that the frontier wasn't there anymore? Turner, what? Where did the american character come from? Well, the frontier basically exactly, is the expansion and like, kind of like the freedom you get from the frontier. Right. So there is no more frontier. What then you move on to Hawaii and the Philippines if you're in danger, if you don't continue to expand. So it's going to be really in the 1890s that the United States starts to really look overseas for in terms of its imperial outreach. Okay? Now, that's not to say that before that, the United States wasn't and imperial power, because the United States essentially conquered the north american continent for the purpose of accessing its resources. Okay? So the United States, let's say, for example, that we're Britain, okay? And we have cotton textiles. Our economy is based on cotton textiles, but you can't grow cotton in England. Right. And so you have to go somewhere else to get it. And they got it first in the american colonies, and then they got it in Egypt and in India. Right. But what they did was they would have to go overseas to get their resources. And the United States didn't have to do that because all the resources we needed were right here on our continent. Right. And so Americans really don't look overseas for. For imperial expansion because they don't need to. Right. But then when we get to the. To the 1890s and what we're going to see is this is kind of the height of the imperialist era. All right? And the imperialist era, essentially what it's going to require is going to be that, that Americans are going to or any country that doesn't become an imperialist country is going to fall behind. Right. Remember, we talked, I think, at one point about the challenge in the 20th of the 19th century was either modernized or be colonized. Right? Okay. So now the way the United States starts to acquire an overseas empire is during the spanish american war. Okay? You can read about the spanish american war in your book. Right. And you will read about that. But the upshot of it is this, that the United States had economic interests in Cuba and it was sugar. Okay? The cuban economy was based on export of sugar, and most of those sugar exports ended up going to the United States, but Cuba was still under the control of the spanish empire. All right? And what happened was that there was an independence movement in Cuba that the Spanish were crushing, okay? And this is going to play into the american press because at the same time, in the United States, there's a competition, a fierce competition between two newspaper empires, the Hearsts and the Pulitzers, okay? And so that competition was based on who can sell the most newspapers. And one of the ways that seemed like a good way to sell newspapers was to report sensational stories, right? You guys are probably familiar with, like, if you're sitting there watching tv on the network tv, which I haven't watched in years, but say you are right, you're sitting on network tv and the commercial comes on. And then right before you go back to your program, there's a little blurb and it says, aliens land in El Cajon. Film at eleven. Right? Right. And so you say, oh, there's aliens in El Cajon. I gotta watch this news, right? And then you watch the news, and all the way at the end, there'll be like a 32nd segment about some little kids in alcohol and dressed up like aliens or something like that, right? But the point was that they got you to watch so you could see all their ads. Right? And that's the same thing that we see with these newspapers. It's called yellow journalism. Right? And the idea behind yellow journalism is you make these stories to be so appealing that everybody wants to buy, and you see it all the time around you now, I mean, there's so much sensationalized news. And why is it sensationalized? Well, because it sells to products. Okay. Same thing happened then. Okay. But the problem was that at that time, and probably still today to a certain extent, right. They often crossed the line. Essentially what they would do is make news. Right. So one of the things, one of the places where we could see a lot of sensational news, Washington, Cuba, right. Because Cuba would, would jail, you know, revolutionaries and, and conduct trials and be oppressive. And, and Americans could read about that and they would say, oh, those, those Cubans, those poor Cubans are just like us. And, and their problem, our problems with the British, but their problems were with Spain, and it was very sensational. Right? And so, but for example, there was one photographer who was sent down to Cuba to take pictures of all the atrocities that were being committed. And when he got there, he cabled back to New York that he couldn't find any atrocities. And the editor said, well, you just send us the pictures and we'll make up the atrocities. Right. You follow what I'm saying? So that's the way Americans are getting their information about what's happening in Cuba. And then the battleship Maine explodes in Havana harbor. Okay? Now, there's good reason to believe that the Spanish didn't have anything to do with blowing up the battleship Maine, okay? But it was sensationalized in America, so much so that they would actually publish newspapers with pictures. Not pictures, but drawings of spanish sailors attaching bombs to the main. Right, okay, so Americans are like, we gotta go get those Spanish, right? And so America ends up declaring war against Spain. And the problem for the Spanish was that their empire was. Was teetering. They had nothing left, really, except for Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the philippine islands. And their fleet was in such bad shape that when they tried to get underway, they sank because the rust was so heavy on the bottom of their ships. So the war was really almost not a war, but Theodore Roosevelt, the american president, is going to call a splendid little war, right? Lasted, like, six weeks, right? And then all of a sudden, the Americans have their. Have this empire. They've acquired what was left of the spanish empire, or they're in control of it, right? So there's Puerto Rico, and then there's. There's Cuba, and there's the philippine islands. All right? And so now, just stepping back a little bit here, when the United States declares war against Spain, one of the things that the United States does is to declare that they would not. They're not in the war to annex Cuba, right? So they promised in this war that they would not annex Cuba. It's called the Teller amendment, right? The idea here is that we're not doing it to gain territory. We're doing it actually to save these poor people from your oppression, essentially. Right? So what will happen then is that the United States can't annex Cuba, but there's a question about Puerto Rico and the philippine islands. And so what will happen is then that there will be a debate that happens in the United States over whether or not the United States should acquire an overseas empire. And guess what it's called? It's called the imperialist, anti imperialist debate.",312

","Well, what does that have to do with a merit with the United States? Well, here's what it has to do, is that there were seeds planted coming out of this great war for empire that will lead directly to the american revolution. Okay? And so let's just talk about what were the outcomes of the war, and this is it. So if you want to, you can take a picture of this slide, or you can go back and look at it, or you can somehow other. Somehow or other get it into your notes, because this is very important. This is the whole reason why we talked about the great war for empire, is because there's these four major consequences of the war that will lead directly to american. To the american revolution. Okay? So the first one is when, during the war, actually, the British will start to send british troops to America, and they will pass a law. The name of the law is the quartering act. And what the act means is that the british army can go to the homes of private citizens, although they're not really citizens, they're subjects, right? But they can go to the private homes, and they can demand that the people who own the home give lodging and basically food and lodging to the british soldiers. So it would be kind of like if you were sitting at home on Saturday night watching tv and you hear a knock on the door and you open up the door and there's like ten marines standing out there, and they're saying, okay, you have to put us up and feed us, right? And you would have to let them in. That was the law, right? Does that make sense? So you're already getting your privacy encroached upon. But not only that, there was a divide between Britain, actually between Europe and America, where the Europeans thought of everything american as inferior, right? So that was between the british and the american colonies and the spanish and their american colonies, all of the. And the french and their american colonies. In fact, one of the french authors, whose name was Buffon, made the comparison between America and Britain or Europe by saying, in Europe they have mighty war horses, and what do they have in America? Deer. Just little, weak, passive, peaceful things. Right? Okay, so there's this arrogance, I guess you could say, on the part of the Europeans, and that's going to be something that's felt throughout the country. So that means then that it's not just the merchants and the lords and the upper class that has this arrogance, it's everybody. And that arrogance then will show with these british soldiers who show up and move into your house. And once they move into your house, they're going to be. They're going to be just. They're going to be disrespectful of your, of your being essentially. Right. They're going to think of Americans as a bunch of ignorant hicks. Right. And. And they're going to treat them that way. So you guys are hicks. Right. And, and so what will happen is that throughout the colonies, there will be a sense where Americans will respond to this ill treatment, this arrogance with a kind of a counter arrogance. And it's going to be called, what we're going to call it Creole patriotism. All right. C r e o l e. Patriotism. Okay, so now you're thinking Creole now doesn't have to do with New Orleans. Right. And it does. Right. But. But here's what Creole actually means. Creole is somebody that's born in America of parents that are from somewhere else. So in France, in New Orleans, let's say people that were born in New Orleans, they were Americans, but they were born. But they were they born. They were children of french people. That's how they become Creoles. Right. And same thing in the spanish empire. If you were, if you were born in America but your parents were from Spain, then you would be a Criollo. Same thing. Right. Okay, so in America, we have, most of the Americans now are born in the Americas, but they're all from, they're all descended from people who came from England. And so they're all Creoles. All right? And the significance of Creole patriotism is that because of this arrogance on the part of the British where the British are saying, you guys are less than us and you guys are a bunch of hicks, right. Americans will start to say, well, wait a minute, we are different, but we're better because, you know, we have a bigger country, we have a cleaner atmosphere, we have cleaner air, we have a higher infant survival rate, we have cleaner cities, we have prosperity. Right? And all of these things are much better than what you guys have in Britain. So there's the response then to this berating that they got from the British is going to be, no, yeah, we're different, but we're better. And so that's when we start to see people in the colonies all start to consider themselves american. Okay, well, now this is important if you think about it, because remember I told you at the beginning that people in America knew they were in America, but they didn't think of themselves as american. So why would it be significant now that all of the people in America start to think of themselves as american when they're united. They're stronger together. Okay, so remember what we're leading up to here. We're leading up to the american revolution. What do we say it was? The american revolution. How can we have an american revolution if there aren't any Americans trying to see them? Like, straight away from. Like, the British. Exactly. They start to recognize their difference. Right. Thank you for saying that, Kayla. So if I. If I. If I now think of myself as different from you, I can imagine myself being independent from you, can't I? But if I'm the same as you, then the idea of independence is ridiculous. Do you follow what I'm saying? So this arrogance leads to this nascent nationalism called creole patriotism that will give Americans a minimum sense of unity. It's not like they all start to think of themselves as the same. They still think. They still see themselves as different, right. In terms of the colonies that they live in. But they will start to see that they are. They have one thing in common that separates them from the British, and that is that they're Americans. You follow me here. And that's going to be an important development in the creation of a sense that America can be independent.",313

","So the arguments against imperialism are going to be really kind of twofold. Right. One of them is more of an idealistic argument, and that is that the United States is not built on the ideas that one country should be able to rule over another country. The United States is built on the idea that everybody should be able to rule themselves. So ideologically, it's against american principles, against the american sense of itself, to start to acquire an empire like the British or the French. Okay. The other argument was a racist argument, and that was that the problem that they found out about Cuba was that most of the Cubans are not white. And so what they came to believe was that if you incorporated non white people into the United States, the United States would not be able to survive because non white people can't rule themselves. That was the same reason why. I mean, they had really the same debate during the mexican american war in 1848, where people were saying, we should just annex all of Mexico. And the Congress said, no, we don't want Mexico because full of Mexicans. Right. You follow what I'm saying? They didn't mind taking the southwest because there was nobody there, essentially. Right? But they didn't want Mexico because it was full of Mexicans. And Mexicans can't rule themselves because they're not white. Okay. Basically, that's the argument that they made. And they make the same argument here about not just Cuba, but anywhere. Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well. Right? Okay. So those are going to be the arguments against creating an empire. Okay. The arguments in favor of creating an empire are going to be these three. Okay. The first one is what we call the white man's burden. This is actually the title of a poem that was written by Rudyard Kipling. And Rudyard Kipling was a british authorization. He wrote the Jungle Book. Right. And he was a very committed british imperialist. He believed that the British, although they were plundering other countries like India, he believed that that was good for the Indians because they were being civilized. Right? And the British called it the civilizing mission. They had a civilizing mission, and wherever they went, they brought civilization with them. And this fits into the idea that the white Europeans are at the pinnacle of civilization and that all of the people of the world are at different stages of civilization. And that the way you could determine the stages was by skin color. Right? So essentially what that means is the wider you are, the more civilized you are, and the darker you are, the less civilized you are. Okay. But there's also this idea of progress, which I think we've talked about a little bit. And what that means is that everybody is moving toward a certain goal, a certain maturity, right? And the belief of people in Europe and in the United States is that, well, we white people have, have achieved the ultimate level of maturity. That doesn't mean we don't have any farther to go, but we're ahead of everybody else, right? So where that fits into the idea of imperialism is that when you're with, for example, when the British go to India, they say, okay, well, we're gonna, we're gonna take your stuff, but at the same time, we're gonna make you advance like us by teaching you democracy and industrialization and all these different things, right? And that would be their duty. Kind of like being a big brother, right? That if you're, if you're in a family and you have, you have an older brother and a younger brother, and the older brother takes responsibility for the younger brother to help him come along, to help him to mature. And that's the way this is kind of like the paternalistic attitude. I can tell you that the first governor of the Philippines, the first american governor of the Philippines is going to say that we had a duty to civilize our little brown brothers. Right? You get what I'm saying? Okay, so this is the, this is the idea of the white man's burden, that the white man is at the pinnacle of civilization and he has a duty to bring civilization to less advanced civilizations, less advanced people. Okay, so remember last week we talked about social darwinism and we said that. Social Darwinism. Somebody explain that to me. I want to see if you guys were listening. Social Darwinism is basically the idea that if you're poor, you deserve to die or you, it's like the natural selection type of thinking, except applied to capitalism, right? If you have enough money or you can survive. If you don't have enough money, you don't survive. Okay, you're right. Okay. But what I want us to do is to think about in the terms that Darwin thought about it, because he was thinking about biology and he was saying that in nature, some organisms are going to be able to adapt and survive and others are not going to be able to and they'll die out, right? So what is that? They adapt to what, what happens? The environment changes. Exactly. There's a change of environment. Okay? So if we're looking at the natural environment, we say, okay, we're living a tropical area, and then all of a sudden there's an ice age, right? So some organisms are going to be able to survive, others, not. Okay. But in an economic environment. Right. What is the change of environment? It's from agrarianism to industry. Right? Okay. So when we looked at it last week, we said, okay, well, in terms of individuals in society, some individuals are going to be able to adapt to the new industrial reality, and they'll survive, but others won't. And the ones who can't adapt should be allowed to die so that the ones that are left over would be stronger. That makes sense. That's what social darwinism is. Okay. And that was the way it was in terms of individuals in society. But it also works in terms of countries in the world. Right. And who's going to be a big believer in this is going to be Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt will believe that the change from agriculture to industry is going to create a challenge for the different countries of the world. Those countries that can modernize are going to become stronger and survive. Those countries that can't modernize are going to die out. We can see the example of that in China and Japan, right? Because China refused to modernize. They said, we're too cool to modernize. We're already perfect. Why should we modernize? And they ended up being carved up by the european powers. Okay? But Japan recognized the threat. Modernize or be colonized. So they did modernize. They forced modernization. Right? But the result of it was that they also became an imperial power and they became an imperial power in Korea and China and later throughout Southeast Asia. Right. You guys are with me. Okay, so this is the idea of social darwinism. If you don't modernize, if you don't adapt to the new economic reality, you're going to die out as a country. And Roosevelt was very insistent that the United States should modernize and should acquire overseas empire in order to be able to adapt to this new economic environment. Okay, you guys are with me. So that's going to be another, another argument in favor of imperialism.",313
50,"US1: 314 -US1: 314
","Okay, the next one, growing american resentment against british indian policy. All right, so what happens is that when the Americans started to engage in the great war for empire, you guys will recall that one of the things that they were trying to do was to get their hands on this territory here, right, and even further west. And so when the war was over, Americans, many of them who had been paid with promises of land in the west, expected that they would be able to move into the west. But the king. What happens is that the Americans and the Indians don't get along very well, as we learned last week with King Philip's mooring. Right. Because the Americans tend to encroach on the Indians land. And so that leads to some conflicts between the natives and the Americans. And the result is going to be that the king will declare that nobody can settle this territory without his expression was permission. And he draws a line. And the line is called the line of proclamation, or the proclamation line, right? And this line of proclamation essentially is the. What separates the yellow from the blue here. The line of proclamation is going to limit where Americans can settle, okay? And that's going to create a lot of unhappiness in America, because Americans believe that the war was for them to be able to get their hands on this land. And many of them had been promised land in this area, and yet now they're denied this land. Okay? So, so that's going to be something that creates a lot of resentment on the part of the american people.",314
51,"US2: 314 -US2: 314
","Okay. The second, the last one has to do really with economics, right? And I want to do, I want to spend a little bit of time here talking about economics. And the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to work on a diagram. Okay? So what we're going to do is we're going to push this x, right? And this diagram, actually, I don't know what all this is. What is that? Okay, so. Oh, crap. Sorry about that. Okay, so now here, what happens with this, this theory. The theory is called dependency theory. Okay, let me just put that up here. And the reason why. We'll talk about it in a minute. Why it's called dependency theory, okay? But what it does is it explains the relationship between the governed and, or I should say, really the colonizers and the colonized, all right? And what the theory is, is that you divide the world up into two groups of countries. And the two groups of countries, we're going to call them the metropolis and the periphery, okay? So the metropolis is all the industrialized countries. Metropolis is the modernized countries. They'll be like Britain, United States, France, Belgium. Those. The periphery is going to be the countries that are colonized, okay? Like Cuba, for example, or Puerto Rico or the philippine islands or other countries. We'll talk more about that in just a second. Right? Okay, but the relationship between them is that the metropolis. I'll say it the other way around. Let's take this one here. And how do we do this? Oops. Yeah, there we go. We'll make this go over here. Right? Okay, so the periphery provides resources to the economy, the industrialized economy of the metropolis, right? So for example, the British in India. The British extract cotton from India to be used in the cotton mills in England, right? And then the metropolis also. Oh, crap. That's not what I wanted to do. Sorry about that, guys. The metropolis also uses the periphery for markets, right? So the, the periphery sends goods to the metropolis and those goods are manufactured, are converted into manufactured goods, and those manufactured goods are sold sometimes back to the periphery. So in the case of Britain, the Indians grow cotton and sell it to the British. British turn that cotton into textiles and sell those textiles back in India, right? And that's the, that's essentially the structure of imperialism for most of the european countries. Okay, questions? Comments about this? Okay, so the problem here, or I should say the situation here, ends up being that the reason why it's called dependency theory is because the economy of the metropolis is not dependent. It is to a certain extent, but not totally on the colony of the. On the economy of the periphery, because the metropolis can make all kinds of different goods, it has a diversified economy. So if, for example, the market goes out for cotton textiles and they can make railroads or they can make cars or something like that. In fact, what happened, one of the places where we could see this was in Brazil. Brazil had an economy that was based on the export of coffee, right? But during World War one, nobody could afford coffee. So the economy of Brazil tanked, right? Because nobody was buying their stuff. Because in the periphery, the peripheral countries only have one thing to sell, right? That's why they call it monostaple, right? So in the metropolis we have diversified economies, but in the periphery, we have monostaple economies, right? So that means then, like I said, if. Let's say we're in Brazil, right? Or let's say we're in Cuba. Let's say we're in Cuba and our export is sugar, right? But if the market for sugar falls away, then our whole economy will collapse, right? Whereas the metropolitan economy can still survive because they. They manufacture things that don't necessarily depend on sugar. Okay, that makes sense to you guys? Questions, comments about that? So it's dependency theory because the colonies are dependent on the metropolis for their economic well being. Okay, you guys got that? Questions? Comments? Okay, now let's think about, well, how do I. How does the metropolis maintain control over the colonized economy? And if we were looking at something like Britain and India, we would say, okay, well, the British actually, this is not what I want. Crap never works for me. Okay, well, the British directly rule. Let me just put that here. You could pretend that it's there. I have to fix this later, right, but the British directly rule India, right? Direct rule, meaning that parliament actually rules over. Over India. You know, India is called the jewel of the british crown, okay? And that's how they maintain control in India. They actually legislate for India. They control all aspects of indian society. Okay, but let's say, for example, the United States. The United States doesn't acquire overseas empires that they directly rule, right? For example, we're going to notice that during this period of time, the United States will have heavy influence on latin american countries. Like in Central America. They call them the banana republics, right? Because that's where they export tropical fruits from Nicaragua, Honduras, places like that. And the United States doesn't rule those countries, but the United States controls the economy, right? And that is going to be called economic imperialism, right? Economic imperialism. And what that means is, let me just write this down for you. Right? Imperialism. Okay, so what that means is that the peripheral country is nominally independent, but its economy is controlled by the metropolis. Okay. Necropolis. And imperial control is accomplished by military intervention. Okay, so let me give you how this. Let me show you how this works, right? So after the spanish american war, the United States actually eventually decided to annex Puerto Rico and the philippine islands, okay? But the United States couldn't annex Cuba because they had said that they wouldn't. Right? And so instead, what happened was they passed a law called the Platt Amendment. And what the Platt amendment said was that Cuba was independent, but that the United States could intervene if the government of Cuba acted in a way that was irresponsible. Okay. So the way Cuba becomes independent is that the United States frees it from the Spanish, but they also write a constitution for them. An american admiral actually writes the cuban constitution. And why do you think that is? Why do you think the Cubans couldn't write their own constitution? They probably didn't know how. Well, I think that the. I mean, there were people in Cuba, revolutionaries that were very well educated. It's not like they couldn't figure it out, but that. Because they were being ruled and stuff. You know what I mean? So they had a dictator for so long that they probably didn't know, like, what rights to give or what rules to have and stuff like that. Just like, generally speaking, not like literally every single one. Okay, I understand what you're saying, but really, that's a. That's a kind of a demonstration of the thinking of the Americans, because what the Americans thought was that they really aren't capable of ruling themselves. So we have to do it for them. And that's this paternalistic attitude, right, that we know how to do it. We're going to show you how to do it because you haven't been able to figure out how to do it your own. Right. Okay? So. So at any rate, you know, right? Constitution puts in place their government at the same time passes this law called the plot amendment. And what the plat amendment says is that if you act in a way that's irresponsible, if Cuba. If the cuban government acts in a way that's irresponsible, the United States can intervene militarily, can send troops, right? And that's what happens. So the United States will then intervene in many spanish american countries for the next two or three decades, essentially. Right? Whenever american economic interests were threatened, the United States would send in troops to make sure that american economic interests were secure. Okay, you guys follow me here. So that's economic imperialism. We don't really droop rule Cuba, but we get all the benefit of their economy. The benefit of economic imperialism is that the metropolis is no longer responsible for the well being of the peripheral country. So if India directly, if England was England directly ruled India, they were responsible for the defense of India, they were responsible for education, public health, for administration, railroads, infrastructure, all those different things, right? But if the United States just controls the economy of Cuba and all the rest of that stuff can be left to the Cubans how they want to do it, right? So the United States doesn't have to spend that kind of money and effort to do that. You follow what I'm saying? So that's the advantage of economic imperialism and american imperialism is going to be almost all economic imperialism, okay? And it's not just american imperialism that is economic. Other countries, Britain and France and Germany also accomplished it in different places, right? But it's going to be the standard, essentially for american imperialism.",314
52,"US1: 315 -US1: 315
","So the next one. And this is the one that is the important one that we all know about, really, that we all think about, and that is this american resentment against taxation by parliament. Okay, so now let's think about, first off, let's say, well, the British won the war, and it was a big victory. We know that. But at the same time, even a victory in a war is going to be very expensive. And who pays the price? The people do. The people do. Exactly. And how do they do it? They pay it in taxes. Right. Okay, so. So now what happens then is after the great war for empire or the seven years war, the french canadian war, the. The british people are being heavily taxed to pay for this victory, and Americans are not being taxed by parliament. And you know, the reason for that is because Americans are not represented in parliament. And it's not that Americans don't pay taxes. All the Americans pay their local taxes to their local assemblies. All of the colonies have their own assemblies. Right. And all of the Americans pay taxes to those assemblies, but they don't pay taxes to parliament. And the reason why is because they don't have representation in parliament. Okay, you guys are with me. But what happens is that parliament will decide, hey, look, we spent a lot of money and blood to defend the Americans against the French, and they should help to pay for it. And so they start to pass taxes on Americans. They start to impose taxes on Americans. But Americans will be adamant about not wanting to pay taxes. Well, a. Nobody wants to pay taxes, but you certainly don't want to pay taxes to a body that you don't have any representation in. Right? So remember what Locke had said. What is the purpose of government? It's to benefit your land. It's to benefit the people. But it's. How do they benefit the people? Protect them. Protect. Protect what? Their land. Their property. Right. So the property isn't just land. Property is also their money. Right. And so if the. If the government. Now, when the government protects your property, how do. What is the agreement between you and the government that allows them to protect your property? You give consent to what? Remember, if we talk about Locke and we talked about in the state of nature and we talked about the beginning of civil government was where all the old guys got together and said, okay, if somebody attacks you, then I'll come to your aid. And if somebody attacks me, you come to my aid, which means I gave up some of my liberty to protect all of my liberty. Right. And then later what? That will evolve into me giving up some of my liberty in the form of property taxes. Right. In order to protect all of my property. Okay. But when we entered into that comp compact, it was a willing compact. I gave my consent for you to take my money. Right. I said I will give you some of my money in return for this protection. Okay? You guys follow I'm saying here. You guys get that? So, so now, when we think about that in terms of government and. And people and a legislature, right. The legislature has the right to take my money. How do they get that right? I have to give. What? Consent. I have to give consent. And how do I give consent? Giving up some of your liberty. Right, but I mean, by what method do I do it? In the United States, United States government has a right to tax me. How do they get that right? Passing laws. Well, but what gives them the right to pass laws? How do. Who passes laws? Government representatives. And how do they get there? By being us citizens. Well, people give consent by doing what? What do they do? How do you send. Elected. Exactly. So, so basically they're elected by the people to represent them. Right? And so therefore, I've given consent by sending a representative to Congress who makes laws. It tells me I have to pay taxes. Right? I've given consent. But now let's just say that the parliament of Canada decides that everybody in San Diego has to pay a 10% tax on watching hockey games, right? Okay. And they go around everybody's house and they make sure you're watch, if you're watching hockey, that you're paying this 10% tax. Right. Would that be fair? Why? What's the difference between me being taxed by the American Congress and me being taxed by the canadian parliament? We didn't choose them to represent us. Exactly. We don't have representation there, so how could we give consent? You get it? And it's the same thing with the Americans. The Americans are saying, hey, we don't have any representation in parliament. How can we give consent? And then what does Locke say? If the government, rather than protecting your property, they take your property, what does he call that? What do you call it? If somebody takes something away from you without your consent, what do you call it? Stealing. Stealing. Exactly. So the Americans see the parliament as stealing their money. Right. The parliament is stealing their money. And if the government, which is supposed to protect your liberty, protect your property, isn't protecting your property, but instead is taking it away from you, then what's your recourse? According to law, you go to war with them. They've already gone to war with you because you're taking away your property. Right. So that means what? You're absolutely right. You're in war. And what's the outcome of the state of war? Death. Death. And in this case, it's the death of the. The offender. Right. Or the end of government. You guys follow saying, so this is where we get the intellectual foundation or the intellectual justification for the american revolution. You get what I'm saying? And so let's look at this argument. I got a little bit of a little drawing here that may help us. All right, there's two different ways of looking at the British Empire. This is the way the Americans look at it. There's the king, and then there's all of the different legislatures that are basically ruled by the king. Right? So in this imagination, the parliament is ruled by the king, and then. And then the assembly in Massachusetts is ruled by the king, and the assembly in Pennsylvania is ruled by the king. And all of these different ones are all ruled by the king, and they all represent the area that they are in. Right. So the parliament then represents Britain and. And the Massachusetts assembly represents Massachusetts. Right. But then what we wouldn't say. What we would say is that we, if we lived in Massachusetts, then we would give consent to being taxed by Massachusetts. But if we lived in, say we lived in England, we wouldn't give consent to being taxed by Pennsylvania. You follow here, see what that is? And that's why the Americans say that they're being taxed without representation. The British are going to respond by saying, well, that's not how everything really works. Okay. That the way it really works is that parliament is ruled by the king, and then that the parliament rules over the empire. Right. So parliament rules England and Scotland and Wales, but it also rules India and the american colonies. And because parliament rules the empire, then it is a given. It's assumed that parliament is ruling the empire for the benefit of the empire. And so parliament will say, okay, well, even though you don't have representatives in parliament, you're being represented in parliament. It's called implicit representation. You're being represented in parliament because we're ruling in your benefit. Okay, so the argument here is that even though you're not paying taxes, even though you're not sending representatives to parliament, parliament can tax you because we implicitly represent you. Okay, you guys get that? Do you buy it? If you were american, would you say, oh, yeah, I get that the parliament's acting in my best interest. Would you say that? No. No, you wouldn't. And Americans don't either. But that's the disconnect, right? The disconnect is that Americans say they're not represented in parliament and therefore. Therefore they should not have to pay taxes to parliament. And the British say, well, the parliament rules everything. And if you remember, that was the big struggle in England. Who rules, the king or the parliament? Right, and what was the end of that struggle? Who actually ended up winning parliament? The parliament. Exactly. All right, so historically you'd have to say, well, the parliament was actually correct in saying that they were the rulers of America. But then also remember that for the last 60 or 70 years, parliament hasn't been able to rule America. So Americans have essentially ruled themselves. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? This is why they call it the era of benign neglect. All right, questions? Comments? Okay, so. So there's that issue of taxation without representation is tyranny. Tyranny. Taxation without representation is tyranny.",315

","Up until the time of the seven Years War, the french and indian war, the British, although they theoretically ruled America, they were distracted by politics at home and essentially had lost control of the empire. So that period leading up to the seven years war, from the time of William and Mary up until the time of the seven Years War, the french and indian war was called the era of benign neglect. You guys will remember that, right? The era of benign neglect was when England passed laws for America that Americans ignored, like navigation acts and things like that. And the Americans had developed a real sense of independence. But as a result of the seven years of the french and indian war, the British tried to reassert colonial control in America. Like we had discussed on Monday with the kid who was a latchkey kid, now the parents are trying to assert their rights, and the kids saying, well, I'm grown up now. I don't need a parent to do this kind of stuff. For me, that's kind of the atmosphere, the kind of paradigm, I guess you could say, for what's happened with this relationship between the colonies and Britain. Okay, so now we have really colonies in America, people in America who really have developed their own independence, and we have the mother country, Britain, trying to reestablish colonial control. So the colonists are going to be resistant to this movement by the British to reassert control. And so let's just take a look at some of the actual narrative. And remember, we started talking about the idea of the taxes, right? And the problem here was that the British had won the war, and it had been a great victory for Britain, but at the same time, it was very expensive. And the british people, the english people, were being taxed heavily to pay for this war. And parliament decided that it would be a good idea to tax the Americans because the war had actually gained a lot for the Americans. In theory, it gained all that land that had once been part of the french empire, now is all british. And plus the american colonies had been protected from the French and Indians. And so the parliament said, well, it would be fair for Americans to pay taxes to help pay for this. So Parliament created a tax that basically they put a tax on goods. Anything that was printed. So that would mean newspapers, just regular paper playing cards, books, anything that was printed, you had to pay a tax on it. And the way that they knew the tax was paid was that there would be a stamp on it, right? So they called it the Stamp act. And they said, okay, you colonists have to buy. You have to pay this tax if you want this manufactured material, the problem for the colonies is that because of the mercantile system, the colonies are essentially forbidden from manufacturing their own. The colonies essentially have to buy things from Britain, because that's the structure of the empire, that the colonies exist to provide resources and markets to the industry or to the commercial interest in Britain. So the idea would be that Americans send raw materials to Britain, and then Britain refines those materials and sells them back to the Americans. Right. So that means if you want anything, as a colonist, generally speaking, you have to buy it from Britain. And if you now have to pay a tax on it, then that's going to be a burden on you. Now, we could say, okay, well, taxes are a burden on everybody, but the taxes are paid for the benefit of everybody. But what was the big problem that Americans had with paying this tax? They didn't have any representation. Exactly. They had no representation in parliament, so they did pay taxes. They paid taxes to their local assemblies and to their local townships and things like that. But they didn't pay tax to parliament because they didn't have representation in. Almost like. It's almost like I said the other day, it would be like if the Parliament of Canada decided to tax all Americans on anything, right. If somebody told you you have to pay this tax to. Right. Would you do it? Would you do it willingly? No. Right. And that's the way Americans felt. Okay, so then what happens is there's this group of people who forms, and it's a really loose group. And I think if we think about today's politics, when we think about the Sons of Liberty, we could kind of, in a way, make a comparison to Antifa. I don't know how much you guys know about antifa, but Antifa isn't really an organization. There isn't any president of Antifa. There isn't any antifa headquarters or any of that stuff. It's just that whenever there's a provocation, then groups of people will come together calling themselves Antifa. And that's kind of the way Sons of Liberty were. Sons of Liberty was not an organization, but it was a group of people who would gather to protest what they considered to be wrongdoing by the government. Okay, so, for example, when you guys have read about when the british governor in Massachusetts tried to assert control over Massachusetts, then the sons of Liberty gathered together and burned down his house and stole his dishes and hung him in effigy. Really, when we think about the Sons of Liberty, we want to be able to think about them as patriots. But what we really see is if you were part of the established society, you would look at them as a bunch of terrorists, essentially. Right? Okay. So at any rate, what they did was they organized protests throughout the colonies. Right? So it was in Boston, but it was also throughout the colonies there was protest against this tax measure. And the result was that the parliament repealed the Stamp act. They said, ok, you don't have to pay this tax. Okay? But at the same time, they passed another law called the Declaratory act. And what the declaratory act said was, well, you don't have to pay that tax, but you have to pay tax to parliament. So the declaratory act essentially said that we have the right to tax you, we parliament have the right to tax the colonies, and we will. And so what we see then is that the fundamental problem wasn't really solved by repealing the Stamp act. And then we see that again just a few years later when they decide to enact some other tax, which they called the Townsend duties. Townsend was the name of the prime minister. Right. And the duties is a tax on imports. And pretty much everything that was imported from Britain, you had to pay a tax on it to parliament. And again, as I mentioned to you earlier, the Americans were reliant on imports. So these duties end up being burdensome to the Americans. All right? And the result was that they organized what was called a non importation movement. Okay. And what that meant was that Americans started to manufacture their own things and to make do. Right. The significance of this is that Americans, when they had to manufacture their own things, Americans were not developed to a point where they could actually manufacture things of the same quality as they could import. Okay? So this non importation movement, then, it plants the seeds for american industry, but it also represents a sacrifice on the part of the Americans. The Americans say, well, we would rather live quality goods than have to pay this burden tax. Right? What happens is that Americans say, okay, they unite and say, we're not going to pay the taxes on imports, we're just not going to import anything. Now, if you are in Britain, and who would you be in Britain who relied on exports to America? What part of the economy? Merchants. Merchants, exactly. Okay. So if the Americans aren't importing anything, what's that going to do to your business? Ruin it. It's going to hurt your business, isn't it? Okay, so now if your business is being hurt by the policies of parliament, how do you think that's going to affect parliament? Will the merchants be happy with parliament? Do you think they'll say, oh, yeah, I'm glad parliament is taxing the Americans, because that's ruining my business. You think they'll say that? What do you guys think? No. Right. And so what ends up happening is that they put a lot of pressure on the parliament. Parliament then repeals the Townsend duties. But the thing that we need to really understand here is that every time the parliament tries to assert its authority over America, even though they back down, Americans come to believe that there's a strategy, really, of oppression coming from the parliament. And keep in mind that many people in America don't even think that they should have to answer to parliament. They think that they should answer only to the king. And so, as we talked about on then, what we see then is this growing tension between Americans and the British, where both sides have become entrenched and they're not able to really gauge the acts of the other party. Okay. And one of the things that makes this worse, actually, is that there are a number of people in America who have decided that it's time to break away from England, that they shouldn't actually be subject to Britain anymore. And what they will do then is they will publish materials that will paint the actions of the British in the worst possible light. For example, Samuel Adams. Not the beer guy, but a different guy. Samuel Adams in Boston, published a paper that was incredibly critical of everything that the British did. Right to the point, almost in some cases, of what we would call fake news. Right. But it had an effect on the people of Boston because they became more and more unhappy. They would become more and more in favor of the idea of breaking away. Okay. All right. Now, in March of. One. One example of this is in March of 1770, there was an incident that happened where the sons of liberty who were. Again, if we were to look at this event and we saw the Sons of Liberty, we wouldn't think of it as. We probably wouldn't think of it as some kind of an organization. We would think of it as a mob. Okay. And their sons of liberty were actually harassing the soldiers who were guarding the customs house in Boston. All right. Well, the customs house is where they collect the taxes. And Americans at this point, see the taxes as their great oppressor. Right? And so they're actually harassing the british soldier who's guarding that, and they start throwing rocks at him. Okay? Now, some of the accounts say they were throwing snowballs. They really weren't throwing snowballs. There was snow, but they put rocks in the middle of them. Right? And so they're throwing rocks at the soldier, and he calls for help, and then some other soldiers come out of the barracks to. To defend him. And then right in the middle of this kind of crisis, I guess you could say that's happening, this heightened tension. Somebody yells fire. And it's really unclear actually who did. But what ends up happening is the british fire on the Americans, and a number of Americans are killed. Okay, well, now, that's bad enough, but there's a british law that says that the british military can't fire on british civilians without the express permission of the king, right? Which meant that when the soldiers fired on the british subjects, they were committing a felony, and the punishment for that felony is death. And so the soldiers were tried in Boston. And interestingly, the man who defended them was a lawyer named John Adams. Okay, John Adams at this point was just a lawyer. He wasn't really a revolutionary. He believed in the law, and he thought he knew that everybody needed a defense. And these guys were unpopular, right? So he defended these unpopular soldiers because been essentially roundly condemned by the local population. They'd already been convicted in public opinion, right? But he argued successfully that they couldn't be held liable, and they were acquitted. Okay, so the problem, of course, with that is that the way that the press will portray that is that the british soldiers violated the law. They committed a felony, and then they got off the hook, right? And it will show then that the British aren't even following their own laws in their oppression against us. You guys get that? Okay? So it creates more tension between the British and the Americans. Now, we'll move forward a little bit later. I think I mentioned this the other day when I was talking about taxation, and I talked about the problem with the British East India Company and how the British East India Company was in danger of going bankrupt. And so parliament decided to rescue them by giving them the monopoly on the tea trade. And so what that meant was that if you were going to buy tea in America, you had to buy, or anywhere in the empire, you had to buy it from the British East India Company. And as I mentioned to you, the parliament thought that this would be well received by the colonists because they knew that the colonists would be able to get the tea really cheap, right? So the idea then was that Americans will have to buy the British East India Company tea, but they'll get it really cheap, so they should be happy. Okay, well, they weren't happy. They were very unhappy. And so one of the kind of results of that is going to be, that's when Americans decide to stop drinking tea. And instead, they drink coffee. So that's why we have Starbucks coffee rather than Starbucks tea, I guess. Right. But there was what they call the tea Party. And what that meant was there was a group of people, interestingly, dressed up as Native Americans, who went onto the ships at night and threw the tea in the harbor and destroyed a lot of tea. Right. But now I got a little clip I want to show you here of not the tea party itself, but the atmosphere in Boston at the time. And it comes from a miniseries called John Adams, which was on HBO. I think you can find it pretty much everywhere. And it's a really interesting and pretty well done and historically accurate video. But I want to show you this one little scene concerning the issue of tea. All right, so let me go ahead and show that here. What is it Mr. Hancock requires of me? You'd like your advice? If he is in need of legal advice, I will speak to him. John Adams is Sam Adams. Exercise to win me over the business. John, the dock, the Eleanor, the beaver, just in their holes full of tea. All British Ships, the king demands their cargo be unloaded. Cargo which we, the citizens of Boston, must pay new taxes, subject to arrest. You will not laugh. This cargo, gentlemen, this is legitimate cargo. Tea from the East India Company that you are bound by law to unload. What's legitimate about it, friend? No other tea is allowed in Boston Harbour. Either we drink the king's foul brew or nothing at all. And who may you be, sir? John Hancock, ship owner. Not John Hancock, smuggler. What's your word, sir? I'm an honest man being strangled by monopoly. Shame on you, sir. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Teach him a lesson. Bastard. Barberism. Barberism. Animal. I of this. People are hurt when they fight for what is right. Approve of brutal and illegal act to enforce a political principle to have. Answer me that. Can you die? So there's your sons of liberty. What do you guys think? Can you hear me? It was insane. It was terrible. Well, that was. Did you guys know about that before? Anybody have known about that? That was actually based on a true event. And actually, the guy who was tard and feathered lived. He was mutilated, actually, but he lived. So how does that affect your thinking about what we call the sons of liberty, the american patriots? Because that mob, that was the sons of Liberty, right? What do you guys think about that? They acted like a bunch of barbarians. Yeah. So can you see how if you were the British, or if you were in established society and you saw these things going on around you. Even though the TTax may have been burdensome, it may have been an oppression, but was this a proper response to it? And interestingly, it wasn't that behavior that was condemned by the people at the time. We look at the tea party now. A lot of people say, oh, yeah, the Tea party. That was a heroic act. It was an act that really leads up to the american revolution, right? And so the people who did it were all patriots and that sort of thing. But the reality was that it wasn't the brutality that people were against. George Washington was against it. A lot of people were against it. It wasn't the brutality. It was the fact that they were destroying private property. They would draw the lines. The whole thing that they were fighting for was the protection, preservation of private property, right? So if you take somebody's property and throw it in the ocean, then that's a bridge too far for the Americans, right? You guys get what I'm saying? So that tells us a lot, I think, about the kind of environment that the american revolution came out of. And that environment was very different from the idealized, mythologized environment that we learn about when we're in elementary school, for example, of the heroic american patriots and the brutal and oppressive British. You guys get what I'm saying? So hopefully, now, I didn't do this because I think that there was something wrong with the American Revolution or any of that stuff. It's not my place to judge it. I just want us to be able to see past the mythology to the reality of what actually happened at that time. Okay, so what happens then is that the parliament will learn about the Tea Party. It was an enormous amount of money that was destroyed. And what will happen is the parliament will pass a series of acts called the Coercive Acts, which Americans call the intolerable acts, right. And this series of acts will essentially close the port of Boston until the money that was destroyed is repaid. Not only do they close the port of Boston, but then they also take away the right of the people in Massachusetts to govern themselves. They impose a royal governor. They essentially make the assembly illegal. Right? So that's going to be the response of the parliament. So there again, we can see this tendency where the British tried to assert royal control and the Americans resist it. And then the response to that is going to be even more control by the British rather than trying to work things out.",321

","I know that we're going to talk about World War one, and most of the time, when we think about World War one, we think about the western front in Europe and trench warfare and being gassed, like the drawing here. But for the United States, we have to start with another foreign policy issue, and that is Mexico. So we want to start, first off in talking about kind of moving forward from our discussion of foreign policy before, and also the discussion of populism and progressivism, is that progressivism really split the Republican Party. And the result was that the one Republican who was pretty popular and also very much a progressive, Washington, Theodore Roosevelt. And in 1912, Theodore Roosevelt decided to run for president again because William Howard Taft, who was president, was not interested in progressive measures. And so he ran for president, but he didn't get the nomination of the Republican Party. And the result was that he ran on a third party ticket known as the Progressive Party or the bull Moose party. The biggest result of that was that the Republicans lost the election and Woodrow Wilson ran as a progressive. So he was a Democrat, but the Democratic Party adopted the platform of the Progressive Party. And if you, I think that you will remember that we talked about the shift in terms of which party was conservative and which party was liberal on social issues. That happened in the election of 1912. So before 1912, the Liberal Party had been mostly the Republican Party. But after 1912, the liberal party becomes the Democratic Party. The thing about Woodrow Wilson was that Woodrow Wilson believed in american superiority. He was very much invested in what we think of as the idea of manifest destiny, that the american way was exactly the right way and that everybody else would eventually want to be just like us. And he promoted that in his foreign policy. So when we think about policy, prior to Woodrow Wilson, we saw, as we mentioned last, we saw the United States intervene in latin american countries to support american imperial interests. But Woodrow Wilson did not think it was, according to America's diplomatic or American really to intervene in terms of supporting his. How he did think it was okay for the United States to intervene in support of democracy. And so we call Woodrow Wilson's diplomacy missionary diplomacy. The idea is the United States has a mission, and we've taught this before. It was one of the themes that we talked about, the american mission. Does anybody remember what the american mission is? To spread democracy. To spread liberty. Exactly. Democracy is part of it, and that's one of the ways that we act. It's one of the shorthands that we use. But in reality, it's spreading that liberal ideology, which we summarized in the word liberty with an exclamation point. So that's democracy, secularism, capitalism, and Woodrow Wilson was a great believer that everybody should live like us. So now, in 1910, we talked briefly about, earlier, we talked briefly about Mexico and how Mexico had become a kind of a stagnant state under the sientificos. We talked about positivism. And by the time we get to 1910, Porfirio Diaz, who I don't have a picture of right here, Porfirio Diaz had been president for over 30 years, and his cabinet had not changed in over 30 years. And so there was a lot of criticism of that from foreign countries. And 1910 was the 100 year anniversary of what they consider to be mexican independence. September 16, 1810, was the day of El Grito. So when you guys are looking forward to Cinco de Mayo and you think that that's Mexican Independence Day, it's not. It's actually a national day of drinking in the United States, but maybe not this year, who knows? But at any rate, the hundred year anniversary that this centennial was coming up in 1910, and the president thought it would be they, that it would. They were opening up Mexico to the world. They were basically making a statement that they had modernized and that they were now part of one of the great countries of the world. And many people were invited to Mexico from all over the world to experience this anniversary. And the, in fact, they had actually rebuilt parts of Mexico City. So if you're familiar with Mexico City and, you know, the, the architecture of Avenida revolution with the, with all the arcs and, and the arches at streets going off and, like, sunset patterns and things like that, that was all part of this, this centennial celebration. And one of the things that, as I mentioned, that was that people in the world were critical of was the fact that Mexico had not really moved toward democracy. And confidio Diaz had always said that as soon as Mexico modernized, then they would be ready for democracy, and he would step aside, and he wanted to make a show of this during the. 1910, are coming up on the 1910 centennial. And so he announced to the world that he was not going to run for president again. The result of that was that there was another man named Madero. I forgot his first name. It'll come to me. Anyway, Madero was a, was a landowner from the north. He had been educated at the University of California in Berkeley, and he announced that he was going to run for president. And he was very popular because people in Mexico at this point were very excited about the idea that there was going to be real democracy. So what happened was that it became obvious that Madero was probably going to, if the vote was allowed to happen, Madero would be elected president. And this was a threat to Porfirio Diaz, who really had no intention of stepping aside. So he had Madero arrested. And the result of that was that Madero, he actually escaped from prison and went to Texas and announced a, what they call a pronunciamiento, or it's really kind of like a revolution. And this is the beginning of the mexican revolution. The mexican revolution will happen from 1910 until, really sometime in the late 1920s. The military portion of it kind of ends in about 1920. But it matters to us is that Madero actually was elected president during this revolution. And then there was a counter revolution, which was led by this guy over here. His name is. No, not Carranza. Huerta. Huerta. Huerta. No, it's not Venusiano. Anyway, the point here is it's Huerta. And Huerta was one of those people in history that not only looks evil, but is evil. And he tries to turn back the clock to go back to the way it was under the Diaz presidency. Well, what was it like under the Diaz presidency? The answer was that the Diaz presidency was very supportive of foreign business. Mexico. So if you guys will recall, the movie that we watched, Los Meneros, that the american copper company owned by Colonel Green, actually owned part of Mexico. The Mexicans had actually sold land to foreigners. And it wasn't just Americans, it was French and British and Germans as well. And with all this foreign investment in Mexico, the problem, of course, with it is that all the wealth that was created by this investment went to the foreign countries. It went to America, Germany, England, and Mexico stayed poor. And at any rate, the point was that these investors, the foreign investors, were very interested in maintaining order. So the foreigners actually assisted in this counter revolution that was led by Huerta, and it included the american ambassador. So the result was that there was a battle in Mexico. It's called la decent, which is the tragic case. And in the end, the president, Madero was dead and his vice president was dead, and Huerta had taken control with the help of foreign embassies, including the american ambassador. But this is something that President Wilson is going to be very much opposed to, because you will recall that President Wilson was very much in favor of extending american democracy, spreading american democracy, missionary diplomacy. And so what happens is that the american ambassador was recalled and Wilson announced his opposition to Huerta's regime. So now there were actually two main leaders at this time in the revolution, and the two main leaders were, I should say, opposition leaders. The two main opposition leaders were this guy, Benustiano Carranza and this guy, Pancho Villa. And I, the Venustiano Carranza was the leader of a party called the constitutionalistas, or people who were in favor of the constitution. So Wilson backed Carranza against Huerta. Now, what happened was that the United States wanted to help the revolution in Mexico, and so they were looking for an opportunity to intervene. And they found the opportunity when there was an incident that happened in a little port on the Gulf coast of Mexico called Tampico, where an american boat was actually captured by mexican forces. They took the american crew off the boat, and that was seen by the United States as a violation of american sovereignty because the little boat had an american flag on it. And so when Mexicans entered the boat, that was the same thing as invading the United States as far as Americans were concerned. So they demanded that the mexican garrison at Tampico raise the american flag and fire a salute to it, which they obviously refused to do. And so the result was then that Wilson sent troops to occupy Veracruz. Now, why? Why Vera Cruz? The answer is because that's where the customs house was. And that means that's where all the tariffs that were supporting the government were collected. And when they took Veracruz, that meant that the where's the government couldn't get resupplies and it couldn't get money. And that led to the. The victory of. Of Carranza. Carranza then becomes president. They held a constitutional convention. The constitution is rewritten. And then Mexico will again experience more. Again experience more disruption when Pancho Villa then rises up against Carranza. Okay, so Wilson is going to be in favor of Carranza because he's duly elected by a constitution. But the United States was also supporting Villa to a certain extent because Wilson really didn't like Carranza, because of the fact that Carranza had essentially given the United States a one fingered peace sign over Veracruz. He demanded that Americans leave Veracruz. And so the United States was hoping that somebody else would take over. What happens is that the United States eventually realizes that Carranza is going to win the war against Pancho Villa, and so they stop supporting Pancho Villa. And Pancho Villa will respond to that by crossing into the United States and invading a little town in New Mexico called Columbus. Burns Columbus to the ground. And in response to that, then the United States will send troops to Mexico to try to find Pancho Villa so he could be brought to trial. They never find him, and the United States almost goes to war with Mexico. There's actually a skirmish between the american army and the mexican army, but Wilson backs off. And the reason why Wilson backs off is because he knows that there are big events happening now in Europe. He believes that the United States will have to be involved in it, and he doesn't want to have the United States involved in a war on the american continent while there's a greater war going on in Europe. So he backs off. Okay, so any questions or comments about any of that? I can see your minds are wandering because you're wondering, why am I talking about all this? What has this got to do with World War one? The real reason why we want to worry about this is because it does show that there's a lot of tension between the United States and Mexico at the beginning of World War one. And it also shows us the kind of the attitude of the american president, which is that the american president is very much an idealist. He believes in using force, but he also believes that using the force must be for. For the idea of spreading democracy. Okay, so. So just keep that in mind as we go on, then, and we talk about what happens in Europe.",321

","These oppressions are being felt throughout the colonies. But the distance between the colonies is so great that it's hard for people in Massachusetts to know what people in Georgia are up to or doing or how they're experiencing. So what happens is that all of the assemblies of the american colonies, even the one in Massachusetts, have been outlawed. Right? Form what they call committees of correspondence. And what these committees do is they write letters to the other assemblies to try to devise a common response to what they consider to be british oppression. And they finally realize that they're not getting anywhere because it's just taking so much time and it's so burdensome. And so what they decide to do is to call a congress. And we call that the first continental Congress, which is called in Philadelphia in 1774. When they come together, what we're going to see, and this is a common theme in american politics, starting really even before the revolution and going all the way up until today. And that is that there are always two voices in american politics. All right? So in the first Continental Congress, we have two different groups, and the two different groups are called the radicals and the conservatives. Okay? Radicals would be people like, at this point, you could say John Adams and Sam Adams and people like that who want to break away from England, who think that the United States should be independent or the colony should be independent, and the conservatives, who are saying, no, we should find some way to find common ground with the parliament so that we can stay part of the empire. In fact, the idea of leaving the empire is almost unthinkable. Right? So the result of this is that this divide will end up with creating two different responses on the part of the american colonies or on the part of the Congress, right? And one of them is going to be the Suffolk resolves, which is the platform of the radicals, and the other one will be a declaration of rights, which is the platform of the conservatives. Right? So let's talk first about the Suffolk resolves. And I'm going to show you a lot of things here. You don't need to write all these down, but let's just think about what they tell us. All right, first off, what are the Suffolk resolves? Suffolk is the county in Massachusetts where Boston is. And what happened after the coercive acts was that the local representatives came together and published a set of resolves in response to the coercive acts or the intolerable acts. Right? So this is actually something that the county that Boston is in has done. Okay. And what they did was they denounced the intolerable acts. They decide to boycott british imports, not export anything, refuse to use british products, pay no obedience to the Massachusetts government Act, which means that they'd taken away the right of the assembly or the Boston port bill, which closed the port. Right. So they're going to pay no obedience to that. They're going to demand resignation from those appointed to that, to the new government, refuse to pay taxes, support a colonial government in Massachusetts free of royal authority, and urge the colonies to raise militia of their own people. All right. Okay. So now let's think about this for a second. If you were going to sum all this up, what do the Suffolk resolve say to the British? Saying, yeah, we totally believe that the british government is legitimate and we're going to follow the law? No, this is basically the start of the revolution, you could say. Exactly. This is a revolutionary act. Right. So the revolution in ideas has already started. And then when we see the Continental Congress adopt the Suffolk resolves, what that's saying is that the american colonies are not going to acknowledge royal authority until these acts are repealed. So, in essence, the american revolution has already begun because Americans have said, we're not going to follow the law. All right, you guys, follow me here. Questions? Comments? Okay, so then the other thing that they do is they pass a Declaration of Rights, basically saying that we are being oppressed by the parliament and we have rights that the parliament shouldn't be able to curtail, but we're still loyal to the king. Right? So the idea here is that, again, as I showed you that kind of little diagram of the empire on Monday, that the Americans don't think that they owe any kind of allegiance to the parliament, only to the king. Right. And that's what they're saying here. And their idea is, well, if the king really knew what the parliament was doing, he wouldn't let it. But the king obviously did know everything about what the parliament was doing. Right? So, at any rate, this is going to be the more conservative response of the Congress. So we have a radical response and a conservative response. And then when parliament learns about all of this, they say, okay, well, you guys can't rule yourselves anymore, and they outlaw all of the local assemblies. All right, so from this point on, we really have two competing governments in America. There's the local assemblies, who don't actually dismantle. Right. And then there's the royal authorities that are appointed to try to bring the colonists back into line. Okay, you guys follow comments? Okay, so now, remember, the last thing that was in the Suffolk resolves said that they were going. Let's take a look here. The last thing was urge the colonies to raise militia. Okay, so the idea then, of the militia is what? The idea of the militia is we need to defend ourselves against the British. And the way that we're going to do it is we're going to arm the citizens and we're going to train to oppose oppression. So when they start training, they're militias. Okay, questions? Comments? All right, so now you guys have heard the shot heard around the world, and this is an interesting episode. Okay, so this is George Washington getting ready to fly to secure the airports. This was in response to Donald Trump's 4 July address where he said that the american revolutionary secured the airports. Right? So this is them going to secure the airports. It's a joke. Okay. But what really happened here was that the royal government in Boston finds out that the militia has not only been training, but they have a cache of weapons in Concord. This is about 10 miles. Okay. So what the governor in Boston says is that he sends soldiers to capture the arms in Concord to take them away from the militia, essentially to dismantle, to disarm the colonists. Right? Okay, so you guys know about the poem the midnight ride of Paul Revere. One if by land, two if by sea, whatever. Right? The idea here, though, is that as the British start to march toward conquered, the militia starts to form up. And by the time that they're formed up, they're here in Lexington. Okay, so Lexington is just a little, tiny village, and it's got a big square in the middle of it that they call the green. Right? Lexington Green. Okay. And what happens is that the militias formed up in the road on the Lexington green, and the british troops march into the village, and then they face off. Right? And what happens then is that the british commander orders the militia to disperse. And they actually do start to disperse, but in the middle of it, somebody fires a shot. And as it is with these historical things, nobody knows who fired the shot. We don't know if it was british for the american, but what we do know is that they started fighting each other. Okay? And the British actually are going to get the worst of it. And the reason why is because of the way the British fight. So the way the British fight is that they form two lines, and then when one line is standing and firing, the other line is on their knees and reloading. All right? This is the way european warfare is done at this time. And their expectation is that the other side will do the same thing. So we have these two lines up and down, firing at each other. And whoever wins the battle is whoever's still standing at the end. Right? So that's the way the British expected the Americans to fight. Okay. But now I want you to remember back a couple of weeks ago when we talked about King Philip's war. Do you remember that? King Philip's war. And how did the. The Indians fight that caused so much trouble for the British, for the colonists, it was because they hid behind rocks and trees and things like that, right. And they didn't fight by the rules. And that's what we see happening here. Americans have adopted that style of fighting, right? So Americans are fighting what they call indian style, and the British think that's not fair, but they don't know how to respond to it. You follow what I'm saying? And that's why the British actually take a lot of casualties in this battle. Nevertheless, they are able to make it to Concord, and they do get the arms and they go back to Boston. But it creates a sense that maybe the Americans could actually beat the British with just a militia. Okay? And by the way, these militia were trained to be called up on a minute's notice. So the militia ends up being called, what? Minutemen. Minutemen, exactly. All right. Okay. Now I want us to take another step back here, and I want us to think about what we just witnessed. And what we witnessed was a powerful central authority face who's trying to exert oppressive power over the people. And one of the ways that they want to do that is by disarming them. Okay? And this is going to be something that Americans remember. Americans remember that there was this powerful central government that tried to take away their ability to enforce their rights. And so when the Bill of Rights is being written later, they will remember this. And one of the amendments that they'll put into the constitution, the Second Amendment, it actually was the third at the time, but it's the second amendment now. Okay? One of the amendments that they'll put into the Constitution is a check on the power of the central government to disarm the states, okay? So the purpose of the second amendment was to prevent something like this from happening, to prevent the central government from being able to disarm the states, okay? So that was the purpose of the Second Amendment, and that was the way that it was actually interpreted all the way up until 2010. Right? In 2010, Supreme Court magically found an individual right to gun ownership. Right? And that's what the NRA and that crowd says about gun ownership now, is that you have a constitutional, God given right to own guns. That's not what the Second Amendment was for. That's the way it is interpreted now. But even that has a limit on it. So if you look at the actual Supreme Court ruling, it will, you will notice that even if there is an individual right, the right is not unlimited. And it talks about different ways that the states have a right and a responsibility to limit, to restrict gun ownership for public safety. All right. Anyways, you can go back and look at that later if you want.",322

","Now, what's happening in Europe? We're not going to get into it in a great, great. I mean, it's an incredibly interesting and also tragic story that really highlights the depths of human stupidity. But in short, what happened was that they. There were two alliance systems in Europe that were counterbalanced to the other. So basically, the real alliance against Germany were the French and the Russians. And the reason why the French and the Russians were allied against Germany was because France was on one side and Russia was on the other. France had actually lost a war to the Germans in the 1870s, and Russia felt threatened by Germany because this had been a period of time when Germany was uniting. And so they saw a common cause by saying that, well, if Germany had to go to war in France, then they would be a have to fight, or either in Russia, they would have to fight a two front war, which nobody wants to do that. Okay, so the French and the Russians are on the side of or against Germany. Germany then gains allies with Austria Hungary, which is an ancient empire that controls much of southeastern Europe, and Italy, which is a newly formed united kingdom. And so they call themselves the central Powers, and you can obviously see why they call themselves the central Powers. Right? And then there was so, so basically, then there were the central Powers and the Franco Prussian Franco russian alliance. And then there was another little country here called Belgium, and Belgium was neutral. Belgium said, we don't want to be. We're not going to be on either side. The problem was that Belgium was a likely path of invasion from Germany into France. And so Britain decided to guarantee belgian neutrality, meaning that if anybody invaded Belgium, then England would be drawn into the war that didn't actually create an alliance with France and Russia, because what it meant was not that if France and Germany went to war, England would get involved, or if Russia and Germany went to war, but only if somebody invaded Belgium. Okay? So what happened was that a lot of really stupid things happen, and eventually they come to the point where they. They're going to mobilize for war. And one of the things about warfare during this period is that warfare has become mechanized, industrialized, and both are actually, all sides had detailed plans of how they were going to fight a war if a war came about. Okay? And the Germans plan was called the Schlieffen plan. And the idea behind the Schlieffen plan was that they would invade Belgium, take Paris, and if they took Paris, that would knock France out of the war, and then they would turn their armies against Russia. Okay? So when they finally do that, when they finally put this plan in motion. Let me just say this. When, before I get to the actual results of the plan, is that the plan, once it's set in motion, can't be stopped because it is too complex. The idea. The idea here is that all of the countries in Europe believed that there was going to be a war, and they all believed it was going to be a very short war. They believed that would be over very quickly. And so the result was that both sides of neither side would be willing to back down once they had started to mobilize, because the mobilization, if you tried to stop the mobilization, then in order to reset it would take days to get everything back in place. So once the mobilization had begun, they couldn't stop it, and Germany starts its mobilization, and then that leads them to invade Belgium and France. So they basically make it to the outskirts of Paris. But because they had invaded Belgium, Britain sends an expeditionary force to France. And with the addition of the british troops, the Germans were stopped at Paris before they entered Paris, and they were pushed back. And then that is going to lead to, really four years of stalemate. Because the idea behind these systems of alliances was that if one country invaded another country, they weren't really just invading that country, they were invading them and all their allies. And so the idea was then that neither side would be able to win, that it would be impossible to win. One country might defeat another country, but one country couldn't defeat a bunch of other countries. And so the idea then would be that it would be impossible to win. And that turned out to be true. It was impossible to win. So because the balance of power was so close or well balanced, I guess you could say between the two sides, the war just continues on and on. And that's where we get into trench warfare, where both sides dig these series of trenches that go all the way from the North Sea to Switzerland, and neither side is able to make any kind of advance for, like, four years. Okay, so then what happens is that because neither side can gain a military victory, both sides declare economic warfare.",322

","Okay, so the Americans, I guess you could say oppression, depredations continue. Americans decide to call another continental congress. This one's called the Second Continental Congress. And they come together to really try to organize a response to the British. And again, they divide into two different camps. On the one hand, the first argument is going to be, how are we going to respond? Are we going to build an army or we're going to have a national army, or are we going to just have the militias? Right. And the argument of the one group has looked at what happened in Boston, and one of the things that happened in Boston was that the British were defeated and they abandoned Boston after battle of Breeds Hill, Bunker Hill. Right. Okay. So some people are saying, well, we don't even need an army, we just need to use our militias. And again, there's always been this real reluctance to allow a standing army, I should say always up until World War II, actually. But there's always been this reluctance to allow a standing army. They don't want to have a central government that has a powerful army that can infringe upon your rights. Okay, so there was a real argument here, but the decision was made that they would try to create a continental army, and then they needed to have a commander, and they picked George Washington. Okay, now let's think about why did they pick George Washington? Well, he had some military experience. You guys will remember that he was in the Virginia militia, although he had quit the Virginia militia because they wouldn't give him a commission, the British. The other thing about Washington that was important was that he was from Virginia. Why would it be important that Washington was from Virginia? Let's think about now who was really pushing for Washington? John Adams. Does anybody remember where John Adams was from? Massachusetts. Massachusetts. Okay. And it's one of the biggest colonies. Right? The other biggest colony is which one do you. Okay, so, so now let's think about it. If you're on the right and you're being bullied, who do you want to be on your side? The biggest guy on the playground. Right. And who's the biggest guy on the playground here is Virginia. Right. So if you can get a virginian to lead your army, that's more than likely going to get Virginia on your side. Right. And that's why Washington was picked. It was actually a political decision to pick Washington so they could bring the Virginians along with them. All right, well, then we go back into our different groups, the radicals and the conservatives. The radicals include John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. And they're pushing for a declaration of independence. The conservatives are going to be a guy named John Dickinson, who was a farmer. He wrote a book called letters from a farmer in Pennsylvania, and he wanted to make up. He wanted to somehow reconcile with the British. Okay? So on the one hand, we have people pushing for independence. On the other hand, we have this idea that we should somehow make up. The public opinion at this time was probably pretty much against declaring independence. This was something that was really unthinkable, the idea that you would be able to declare independence. Right. It's kind of like if we decided that San Diego was going to declare independence from California, right? I mean, who would even think that was a good idea, you know what I'm saying? And that's the way people thought of it. You just can't do that. Right. But what happens is that there's a pamphleteer. He was kind of a misfit, I guess you could say. His name was Thomas Payne. He'd had a lot of trouble in England, and he finally emigrated to America with letters from Benjamin Franklin, who was in England at the time, and he came to America. So he's very anti monarchy, right. And he's going to write a little pamphlet called common sense. And what the pamphlet says is that Americans need to look past what they think of as common sense now, because common sense at that time was that they would continue to have a monarchy. Right. And he said that if we look at all these things that we're being oppressed by and we look at all the resources that we have, there's no reason why we should be ruled by Britain. And this is going to become a very popular pamphlet because it really states what many people have already started thinking, that being part of the empire really isn't that great of an idea and that we should be. So what we see then is this shift in public opinion towards independence. And because of that, the Congress will actually write and publish a declaration of independence. Right. So that's going to be how the Declaration of Independence actually happened. Okay. Well, the next thing is that there's going to be essentially eight years of war, which is seven years. Seven or eight years of war, which is going to be mostly bad news for the Americans. The Americans barely survive, but in the end, they will win. Okay? They will win independence. And this is why, basically, these three big reasons. And again, obviously, this is really oversimplification, but the three big reasons are that, first off, George Washington didn't lose. Okay? What that means is that George Washington was not a sort of. He was not a conventional general. Right. Because a conventional general. The way that it worked was the way that war was supposed to work at that time was that they would have a battle and whoever lost the battle would surrender. Okay. But Washington would have a battle and he would lose the battle. But he didn't surrender. Instead he left. He ran away. Right. Okay. And then he would come back and fight again another day. So that broke the rules. But it also meant that Americans didn't lose the. Okay. And even later, when the British were able to take Philadelphia, which is the american capital at the time, the idea was that if you take the unemployment's capital, then you win. Right. That was capture the flag. Right. But when the american government just left. So the British didn't win. They couldn't win because the Americans wouldn't give up. Okay, so that's the first part. The second part is the french alliance. The Americans sought an alliance with France and were eventually successful in gaining that alliance. Not on the part of the French because the French were in favor of America's ideas of liberty and that sort of thing. But if you'll recall, the French were still very upset from the loss in the french and indian war. So what happens then is when France allies with the Americans, then all of a sudden, for Britain, it's no longer just a colonial war. Now they have to fight the war all over the world because the French and the British are going to be fighting in Europe and in America and in the Caribbean and in Asia and South America. Right. And in fact, the last battle of the american revolution was fought in India. Okay, so then what happens is that this little skirmish that was happening in this little disturbance that was happening among the colonists in America is now a global war which is costing the British a lot of money. Right, and blood. Okay. And then finally, with the loss at Yorktown, the British had already lost one army at Saratoga and that had actually caused the french alliance to come into play. They lost another army under Cornwallis at Yorktown. And that will bring down the government and the public will demand, essentially that the British come make peace with the Americans. Right? So the British then decide to negotiate with the Americans. This happened in 1786, I think. But they argued in Paris over the treaty for a couple of years. Okay, so at any rate, the British then make peace with the Americans based on the fact that the british public would no longer support the war. Okay, now you may be wondering, what is this painting? What happened at the time was whenever there was a major treaty that all the people who were involved in the treaty would come together for a portrait. Okay? But the British were so upset, they were so embarrassed at having lost the war to these american colonials that they didn't show up for the portrait. So the only people that ended up in the portrait were the Americans. Okay? This is a real portrait. It's actually hanging in John Adams'house in Massachusetts now, all right? And that's how the Americans won the war. Now, let me just ask you this question. Just knowing what you know about history, can you think of any other example of when a tiny country that was militarily deficient was able to defeat a mighty country because the people of the mighty country just gave up on the war, would no longer support it? Can you think of an example like that? Vietnam. Exactly. That's exactly what happened in so, all right, so the Vietnamese learned from american history, even if Americans didn't. Okay.",323

","The economic warfare, basically is we're not going to let anybody trade with our enemies. That will prevent them from being able to prosecute the war. So the British then declared a blockade around the North Sea and in the Mediterranean to prevent anybody from trading with the central Powers. And then at the same time, the Germans are going to announce a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, which will say that they'll. They'll declare what they call an exclusion zone around the British Isles, and they'll say that anybody that is caught within the exclusion zone can be sunk without. Without warning. Okay, so, so basically, then, what the. The British are saying is nobody trade with Germany, and what the Germans were saying is nobody trade with Britain. Who's nobody. What country insists on free trade? The United States. United States. Exactly. So what's going to happen is that the United States will basically be angry with both Germany and Britain. And one of the things that we need to understand is that at this point, the United States and Britain weren't great allies like we are theoretically today. Right. We didn't think about Britain as our mother country or our cousins crosses the ocean. Many people still what did. What they call waving the red flag, which was. Or waving the red shirt, which was basically that the British had been the tyrants that the Americans had broken away from. And if you'll recall, we talked about last week how the United States almost went to war with Britain in 1894 over Venezuela. So. And on top of that, there were many irish people living in America, and the Irish didn't have any great fondness for England. And at the same time, there were many Germans living in America, and they didn't have. They did have fondness towards Germany. You guys follow I'm saying? So America wasn't automatically on the side of the British. In fact, the United States again tried to stay neutral, and there was sentiment on both sides in the United States. So there were some, many people in the United States who supported the British, and there were many people in the United States who supported the Germans. Okay. The president supported Britain. The reason why the president. Who's president now? Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson, right. So the reason why the president supported Britain was because Britain was allied with France. And what was the similarity, what was common between the government of Britain and the government of France? And what would be common about the government of Britain and the government of France and the government of the United States? What kind of government did they have? Democratic. Democratic. A liberal government. So Britain and France are both liberal countries. The problem is Russia isn't. Russia is one of the most anachronistic monarchies. It's essentially its government system hasn't really moved much beyond the Middle Ages. Okay. So when Wilson is in favor of Britain and favors Britain and France in the war, he does so because they're democratic countries. Germany, Hungary and Italy, all monarchies. And so the idea then is that he wants to support the spread of democracy, but because of the fact that if the United States entered the war, it would also be allied with Russia, he was reluctant to get the United States involved in a war. Okay, you guys are with me. So now what happens is, with this trade blockade, what we see is what I talked about last week with the foundation, really, of american foreign policy, which was that the United States had agreed not to interfere in european affairs, but also insisted on free trade. And what we see happening then is that the United States is faced with either interfering in european affairs or giving up their right to free trade. And so what we'll see then is that's going to actually be an argument that happens in the United States. Should the United States get involved in the war to support its free trade or not? Okay. And then we already talked about missionary diplomacy. What was. What was. How did Wilson view the conflict? Which was. I have to say this, the conflict itself was over world empire. Was it going to be the British and the French that are going to maintain their world empire, or is this new power, Germany, going to rival them? And neither side really were fighting for government. They weren't fighting for democracy or for monarchy or any of those things. They were fighting for empire. Okay. But the United States is not worried about. They don't care about empire. What they care about, or at least what Wilson cares about, is democracy. Okay, so the United States will get involved in the war, but it gets involved in the war because of. Because of a different reason than the wars actually being fought. And we'll have to kind of think if we can see that again sometime in the weeks coming up. Right. So now what happens. In 1915, the British sink a ship. The ship's called the Lusitania. Here's a kind of a. This is what the front page of the New York Times looked like. Lusitania was actually a british ship, but it was carrying a lot of Americans. It was also carrying american war material, which is probably one of the reasons why it was sunk. But the Germans were pursuing their policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. The problem with unrestricted submarine warfare was that it broke the rules of maritime warfare, which was at this time, if you were going to attack a merchant vessel, you had to give them the opportunity to surrender. So what would happen, in theory, was that the war vessel would approach the merchant vessel and fire a shot across their bow. You've heard that before, right? Fire went across their bowden. Okay? And then when they fired one across their bow, then the merchant vessel could either be, they could either surrender or then they could be sunk if they didn't surrender. Okay, but what happens with a submarine is that if a submarine surfaces and tries to warn the merchant vessel, they're so weak, they're so vulnerable, that the merchant vessel might even be able to sink them. So they don't do it. It's all done secretly, unrestricted. And the result of that then, is that they sink these ships without warning. And that was seen as a great violation of the rules of war. Okay, now we have to think about this for a second, because it's only the west that thinks about the rules of war. If you think about what war is, war is the absence of rules, if you think about it. Right? Okay. But the west is going to be able to say, well, you guys broke all the rules, and that's going to be a convincing argument for Americans. So the British are going to be making a lot of propaganda statements toward Americans with the idea of shifting public opinion to their side. And they are successful at that. Okay? So slowly, as the war goes on, american public opinion is going to support the British against the Germans. The result of the attack on the Lusitania was that Wilson made an announcement that it was going to hold all parties to strict accountability. Strict accountability means that if you do this, if you break the rules of war again, the United States is going to go to war. And the Germans weren't really afraid of the United States, but they knew that the balance of power was so close that if the got involved, it could be a death blow. And so the result was they decided to suspend their unrestricted submarine warfare for the next few years. And that keeps the United States out of the war. And then in 1916, there's an election in the United States, and Woodrow Wilson is reelected on the platform. He kept us out of war.",323
59,"US2: 324 -US2: 324
","Well, he didn't keep us out forever. And here's what happens. The first thing is that, well, first off, let me just talk about the kind of war that world War one is, and it's known as total war. What does total war mean? Total war means whole nations against whole nations. Okay? So the way that warfare had evolved through the centuries was that wars were fought by armies and that the civilian population was off limits unless they got in the way. Okay, so basically, then you have the two armies go out, and they meet each other, and whichever army wins, I wins the war, and the civilians are left out of it. And that was kind of an unwritten rule. It was actually broken in the american civil war by William Tecumseh Sherman in his march to the sea, when his idea was that if you wage war against civilians, that will prevent them from being able to support the troops and that will end the war sooner. And so you can see then that when Sherman was marching to the sea, he was destroying plantations, he was destroying railroad tracks, he was destroying the ability of the civilians to support the war effort, which, in turn, prevented the army, the southern armies, from being able to recover from their losses. And so this is going to be the first use of total war in the modern era. But the american civil war had been a kind of experiment, a kind of a proving ground for the concept of war in the late 19th century. So the world War one was actually fought based on the lessons of the American Civil War. Okay, another place where we can see that is in trench warfare. Trench warfare was not something that was practiced until Robert E. Lee dug a bunch of trenches around Richmond and Petersburg in order to keep the superior Union troops from advancing. And that's going to be adopted then, also in World War one. The thing about total war is that it's not two armies against each other. It's whole populations against each other. So, for example, it's not just the Germans against the british or the german army against the british army. It's all of the British against all of the Germans. So everybody, all the civilians in England, are somehow involved in the war effort, and all the civilians in Germany also somehow involved in the war effort. And the whole war effort then, is going to be against the other nation. And really what that does is it means that there aren't any innocent civilians, that it's the whole country at war you guys are winning. And this is going to be the way that world war one is fought. Okay, before we go any further, I want us to think about how would that work in the United States, another country attacking us. Well, how would it work for the United States, for all of the Americans to be against all of the English or all of the Germans or all of the French? It would be hard because there are so many loyalties in the United States because we're all immigrants from those places. Exactly. So. So you could say that in a total war, there's. There's. You could say we're all British and we're all against the Germans. Right. Which is kind of ridiculous because there's all kinds of mixing and always gone on. Right. But in America, you couldn't say that because Americans identify with the place where they came from. I mean, even today, most of us will say, well, you know, my grandparents came from. My grandparents came from Norway. Right. You see what I'm saying? So. So we always identify with that. We don't necessarily all. There isn't any such thing as an american nation in terms of ethnicity. You guys get what I'm saying? And so that's gonna make it difficult for the Americans to get involved in this total war thing. And what will end up happening? The result of it is going to be that there's going to be backlash of Americans against other Americans. So, for example, Americans will target people with german last names, and they will basically lynch them or run them out of town. And what will happen is, as a result of this, many people with german last names will anglicize their names. They'll change their names to something that sounds more English, essentially, and that will help them to stay kind of on the right side. But it shows this. It shows this sense of otherness that can be created, which doesn't necessarily have anything to do with race, because if you put a british and french and a German standing next to each other, you wouldn't know who was who until they started talking. You follow what I'm saying? So you can create this sense of difference without even worrying about skin color. And what is the motivating factor? The motivating factor is fear. You're the other, and I'm afraid of you. You Germans are going to destroy us. Let me just show you this here. What do we see here? What do you guys see here? This is a. This is a recruiting poster from World War One. This is one of many. Okay, but what do we see in this recruiting poster? An uncivilized representation of probably the Germans. Okay, so we know you're saying that this gorilla is german. I don't know. Maybe. I think so. Brutes with the helmet, with the spike on it. So, yeah, it's got the pickle Halber helmet. Right. Also, I don't know if it's hard to see, but it's got culture with a k. Right, which makes it german. Okay, but what's he doing? He's landing on America's shores. Right? So, so what do we see behind him? What is this? The ocean. Right? Supposed to represent the Atlantic Ocean. And he's coming from. What's this in the background? Europe. Right? And what's happened to Europe? Looks like it's in shambles. Right. He's destroyed Europe already with his culture club. Right? And now he's coming to America, and. And then who's he got in his. Who's he got in his hands? I'm having trouble hearing you. Okay? I'm sorry. What can I do to help? Can you hear me now? Sorry, that was Siri. I'm sorry, sorry. I accidentally activated my siri. Oh, that was the phone. I can hear you. Tell your Siri to shut up. Right. So anyway, so who is it? Who is this gorilla holding? Is that lady liberty? Could be. Or who else could it be? It could be your. Your sister, your girlfriend, your daughter, your mom, right? Of course. Nobody's mom dresses like that. But. But you get what I'm saying, though, right? So who do you think this is appealing to? The men. The men, right. Because they. What is the job of the men? The men. The job of the men is to, you know, protect our women's. Right, okay. And it's. It's encouraging people to enlist what emotion is being called upon here? Fear and anger. Fear and anger. Exactly. So fear and anger. And what this fear and anger does is it takes everybody that's germane and turns them into gorillas. Why would they be gorillas? Why couldn't they just be people? They're not the same as us. They're not the same as us. But also. What? They're less. Less. He humanizes them. They're not humans. And why do we have to make them not humans? We can justify killing them. Exactly. You can kill farmers, you can kill monsters, but you can't kill humans. You can't kill your brother. Right? In theory. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying here? So this is going to be what really drives Americans toward supporting the war. And it also splits Americans. Americans. You're going to see in the United States a real backlash against German Americans during this period of time. All right, well, anyway, now, moving on, the russian revolution, what happens is that Russia is going to be actually, this isn't the best map. Let me show you the other map. Russia is going to be doing poorly in the war from the very beginning. What will happen is that Russia will actually invade Germany, but the Germans will push back the russian advance. And the only reason why they can't finish their conquest of Russia is because they're tied down here on the western front by the western allies. And in the meantime, the ottoman empire, what's left of the empire of Constantinople, is going to. Is going to join the war on the side of Germany. What that does is it cuts off the flow of goods to Russia from the outside world. The warm water port in Russia is right here in the crimean peninsula, which you can't see, but it's there. If you close, the only way to get there is through this very narrow waterway called the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. And if you can't get goods through there, then Russia can't get goods from the outside. And when the war is progressing, Russia will experience crop failures, meaning that people are starving and the Russians continue to war, but the people are starving. And that's going to lead to an opportunity for communists to rebel, to conduct a revolution against the monarchy. And the result of it is going to be that in 1917, there's going to be two different revolutions in Russia. The first one happens in March, and the march revolution replaces the monarchy with a liberal democracy led by a guy named Alexander Kerensky. And if you want to know what Kerensky looks like, he looks like Herman Munster. So if you don't know who that looks like, then go look him up. He just doesn't have the bolts coming out of his neck. But Alexander Kerensky becomes the leader of this new liberal democracy in Russia, and that liberal democracy will last until October, which is really November in the western calendar. You guys have heard of the movie the hunt for red October? Red October is when the Bolsheviks are going to depose Alexander Kerensky and take over this Russia as the Communist Party. The Bolsheviks. Right. And we're going to talk more about them when we talk about the cold war. Okay? But for now, just understand that for a period of time between March and November, Russia was actually a liberal democracy. Okay, you guys following here now, why would that be important? We would see them more favorably. Right, because what was keeping Wilson from. From joining the war on the side of the allies? They didn't like Russia. Russia was a monarchy. That Russia was a monarchy, and we didn't want to be allied with a monarchy. All right, so now, in the meantime, what happens is that the Germans see this as a great opportunity. Their idea is that they're going to launch an enormous offensive on the western front that will crush the allies, and then they'll move their armies and take over Russia. Or actually, no, it was the other way around. They were taking their armies away from Russia and moving into the western front. Okay. The reason why was because when the Bolsheviks took over, they left the war. They left the war. So then there was this. They figured that in the meantime, what they could do is they could resume unrestricted submarine warfare. And their idea was that even if the United States did declare war, they could never get organized to send troops to Europe before the war would be over. That was their gamble, essentially. It turned out to be a bad gamble. But just to be sure, the german foreign minister, Arthur Zimmerman, sends a telegram to the mexican president, Benustiano Carranza, suggesting that if the United States declared war on Germany, then Mexico should declare war on the United States, and that after the war was over and the Germans had won, that the Mexicans would receive all the territory that they had lost in the mexican american war, which was Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, parts of Utah, Nevada, a huge area of land. In fact, half of Mexico, really. Okay. So now what happens is that the mexican president never answers the telegram, but the telegram is actually intercepted by the British, and the British end up publishing it in the american press. And the american press, the Americans are going to become unalterably in favor of war against Germany. Americans are going to insist that the United States must crush Germany because they had threatened to take away american territory. And the Americans are like, how dare they threaten to take away this territory that we won, that we conquered fair and square, right? That we stole fair and square. Okay? And so because of that, because of all these different things, now that Russia is now a liberal democracy and because the people are demanding war against Germany, Wilson declares war, and the United States enters the war, and the United States actually sends troops to Europe, and those troops are actually going to make a difference. And the reason why, again, was because the balance of power was so precarious that the introduction of this new, fresh power from America is going to turn the war in favor of the Allies. And the Allies didn't start to push the Germans back. And the result of that then was going to be that the Germans would eventually realize they couldn't win the war, and they will negotiate a peace before the Allies enter Germany to prevent Germany from being destroyed.",324

","I want you to notice that when the United States enters the war again, the reason why the United States enters the war is because of Wilson's idealism, the idea that the United States was going to get involved in this war and that the outcome of the war would be that they would depose all of the monarchies. And his idea was that if there weren't any more monarchies, then we could all be happy. Democratic countries with capitalist economies, and we'd all be happy. And because of that, there wouldn't be any more wars. Right? So that's how this came to be known as the war to end all wars. Okay. The other idea that. That he had was that the United States wasn't in the war to conquer, but the United States was in the war to end the war and to bring about peace. Peace, freedom. Peace and freedom, right? The United States is involved in the war not because we want to conquer anybody, not because we want to gain an empire, but we're there because we want to bring a peace and freedom. And this is going to set the tone for american foreign policy, for american engagement in the world from then all the way up until now, with the exception of the last four years. The idea being that America gets involved in world affairs in order to support democracy, but not for any other reason. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying? So this is going to be the basis for this idea that we're the Americans, we're the good guys, we're here to help, right? You guys are with me. Questions, comments about all this? Okay, so. So now what happens is that the german high command is going to recognize that they can't possibly win, and so they'll. They'll make a. They'll make a contact with the Americans saying that they want to make a. They want to end the war based on Wilson's ideas that are laid out into 14 points. You can lay. You can. You can read about the 14 points in the book, but the 14 points are much more agreeable to the Germans than the idea that the French and the British have, which is that they want to crush Germany. So Germany offers to surrender to the United States, but Wilson refuses to accept the surrender as long as the Kaiser is the monarch in Germany, the Kaiser is still in power. So the result then is that the Kaiser abdicates and a republic is formed. And then the United States accepts the surrender of Germany. There's an armistice reached. The armistice goes into effect in the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918. So November 11, at 11:00 a.m. in the morning. That's the only am there is actually the peace goes into effect, the ceasefire, and then they're going to negotiate a treaty. Okay. One of the most tragic episodes of the entire war is going to be that between the decision, the agreement for an armistice was reached at 06:00 in the morning, but the. The armistice didn't go into effect until 11:00 in the morning. And so between 06:00 and 11:00 both sides pushed the advance, pushed their men in an aggressive way, trying to gain as much as they possibly could. And so I think somewhere like 600,000 men died in the last 5 hours of world War one. Okay. Questions, comments about this? And that's why I said this shows kind of the extent of human stupidity. You know, Albert Einstein said, there are two things that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And I'm not sure about the universe. So. So anyway, now the war is over, and Wilson is seen by the Europeans as a great hero. So Wilson is going to leave the United States and go to help to negotiate a treaty at Versailles, which is the palace of the french king outside of Paris. It doesn't show. Yeah, here it is right here. There's Versailles. Okay. And when he gets there, he's. Again, he's greeted as a conquering hero. Everybody in Europe loves him, but he made a couple mistakes, and the first one was that he didn't involve the Republicans in his. His expedition. He left the Republicans completely out of his peacemaking efforts, which is going to come back to haunt him in a few minutes. Right. But the other thing was that when he got to Versailles, he couldn't care less about the division of what was left of the german empire. He wanted to implement his ideas of peace without victory. So I picked out three different aspects of that that we can think about for a minute. The first one is national self determination. The idea is that every country should be able to determine for itself how it will be ruled as long as it's democracy. Right? You guys get it? So national self determination. Why do you think the allies wouldn't like that? Think about Britain and France. What are they? Empires? A lot of different nations under control. Exactly. So now do you think that the French are going to say, hey, let's have. I got an idea. Let's just give up our empire in Southeast Asia, or the British are going to say, hey, it'd be a great idea to just let India go. Right? What do you guys think? Or anywhere in Africa, you guys follow what I'm saying? So this is never going to become part of the treaty. Okay? The other one is the United States is going to lobby, I guess, for unrestricted free trade. What would be wrong with that? From the point of view of the allies, if there was unrestricted free trade, that would mean that the Americans could trade with India or with Vietnam. What would be wrong with that? That, again, goes against empire, right? What's the whole purpose of having an empire? The whole purpose of empire is to support your economy. And the way that you do that is you control the economy of that other country. You follow what I'm saying? So the Europeans are not going to go for that either. The last one, though, is collective security. All right? Collective security is a counterbalance to the balance of power politics of before the war. Because the balance of power politics was supposed to keep war from happening because neither side would be powerful enough to overcome the other. And that last part was true, but it didn't keep the peace. And so Wilson's idea was, well, rather than having two sets of equal powers, we should just have everybody on the same side. We'll have what's called collective security. Right? So that means then that if one country invades another country or one country threatens another country, they're actually threatening all the countries. Cause he's saying all the countries in the world should be part of this. What's going to be called the League of Nations. Right? Let's think about this for a second, because I'm going to. I'm going to pick some people here. I'm going to pick Ian. You have to be a country. What country are you, Ian, you pick any country, you're muted. I'll be Czech Republic. Because. Okay, he ends the Czech Republic. And, Delaney, you have to pick a country. I think I would pick Switzerland. Okay, so we got Czech Republic and Switzerland. And Angelo, you're going to be the United States. Okay? Okay. So now. So now what happens is that we're all in the League of nations, meaning we're all on the same side, but Switzerland decides to invade the Czech Republic, right? So now when Switzerland. Actually, all of us in this class are. We're all countries, right? But when Switzerland invades the Czech Republic, what are you supposed to do? Anita, we're supposed to help Switzerland. Exact. No, sorry, at the Czech Republic. Exactly. What are we supposed to do? Nay, nay. What are we supposed to do? What are you supposed to do? Your country, you're supposed to protect it. Protect your people, which people take care of it. Remember what Anita said, john, who? You. What are you supposed to do? You're people. I mean, I guess if you're the ruler, the people that's in your country that's supporting you, I guess. Okay. What? But let's think about now. What we said was that everybody has to support the one that's being attacked. Who's being attacked here? Ian. I. Ian's being attacked. Right. Okay, so if. If it's. It's Linda. Linda, you're. You're the. No. Who is it? Delaney. Delaney attacked Ian. Right. And so we're supposed to help who? We're all on the same side. Who are we supposed to help? Constantine. Who are we supposed to help? Both. We're supposed to defend whatever the United States has attacked with. We're supposed to help them. Okay, pact with everybody. Who are we supposed to help? Democracy. Well, not necessarily. Not necessarily. We're helping the people who are under attack. Right, exactly. So. So that means that if everybody here is a country, and everybody here has to come to the aid of the Czech Republic. So, Anita, Professor Cox, Ney, Jianda, Kyle, Linda, Bajad, all you guys have to come on the side of Ian. And then the idea would be that if all of us were on the side of Ian, then Delaney wouldn't stand much of a chance. You guys get what I'm saying? And so that's the idea behind collective security. You guys get that? That if you attack one, you attack everybody, and you couldn't possibly win against everybody. You guys follow me? Aaron, the problem has to do with the american constitution, because, Angelo, if. If Delaney attacks Ian and you're the United States, what are you supposed to do? Defend Ian. Exactly. What's wrong with that in the United States is that we're supposed to have unrestricted free trade. Well, no, that's not it. Just think about how. Who declares war in the United States? In theory, the president. No. Congress. Exactly. Congress has the war making powers. Right? So. But in this case, what we see is that Congress doesn't have anything to do with it. We're in a treaty. So Delaney attacks Ian, and we're drawn into this war without even Congress getting involved. You follow what I'm saying? So it's a threat to american sovereignty. Okay, so here's what's gonna happen. Everything in the 14 points is going to be rejected by the Europeans. The only thing that Wilson will get out of it is the league of nations, which is collective security. But the problem is going to be that because he didn't include Republicans, Republicans were not going to be on board with what he did and are also going to be concerned about american sovereignty. And so the United States never ratifies the treaty. Okay? So the United States ends up making a separate treaty and the United States doesn't even join the league of nations because we've rejected the treaty. You guys follow what I'm saying? Okay. So that's going to be really a kind of a defeat for the United States. All right, I. Let me just show you one last thing here, and then I'm going to let you guys go. Right. But what happened at Versailles was that the winners got together and they decided that they were going to divide up the world's empires, okay? What was left of the austro hungarian empire and what was left of the german empire, okay? And what they did was they sat down at a table in Versailles and they drew a map, started drawing lines on a map, right. And the lines that they drew created countries that had not existed before, like Czechoslovakia. Right? But their idea was, well, we can make a country out of Czechoslovakia just by drawing lines on a map. Right. We can make a country out of Hungary or Romania or Yugoslavia. Right. Or Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, Tanzania, Vietnam. Right. All we can just. We can go ahead and make countries out of these just by drawing lines on a map. The problem was that creating a nation is much more difficult than just drawing lines on a map. Right. One of the examples is going to be, for example, Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia is going to be torn apart after world War two into two different countries, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Right? But then let's look at the Middle east here, right? In the Middle east. This is what's left over from the Ottoman Empire. Okay? Turkey becomes an independent country, theoretically democratic, but then we create new countries. Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq. Okay, so now what is Iraq? Iraq is actually had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for 1000 years. And it had never been a single country. It had always been three different areas. One was dominated by Shiites, one was dominated by Sunnis, and one was dominated by Kurds. And they didn't get along with each other. And that's why the Ottomans left them in their own separate areas. You guys follow what I'm saying? But now the people in the west come along and they draw a line on the map and say, okay, you guys are all Iraqis. Okay, how does that work out? Not. Not well. Not well. Not well. Okay. And what happens then is that these groups are all squabbling with each other until a strong man like Saddam Hussein comes along and quashes all dissent essentially right, but it doesn't create a country. And then when the United States goes in, their expressed goal was to defend the iraqi nation from dictatorship. The question, though, is what Iraq nation? There was no iraqi nation. Do you follow me here? And so the result was that the United States was defending a fiction based on the ignorance of history. It's a good idea for american policymakers to know history, don't you think? And this happens everywhere else, too. This is going to be where they divide all the, all the different divisions of the countries in Africa, for example, are based on the colonial reality rather than on the ethnic reality. And that's why there's so much unrest in Africa. You follow? I'm saying, even to this day. And then also all the unrest in the Middle east comes out of the Versailles treaty, right? So my argument is that the Versailles treaty was one of the most destructive acts in history because it's created so much turmoil, so much bloodshed, and it continues today.",325

","In this section we will examine the first years of the american republic and some of the challenges facing the new nation. We will also see the foundations of american politics that will continue into the present day and learn how Americans were able to discover the key to a successful democracy. The Continental Congress, which functioned as the de facto government throughout the American Revolution, transitioned into the governing body under the Articles of Confederation. Drafted during the latter stages of the war and ratified in 1781, the articles established a weak central government and a strong alliance of sovereign states. This emphasis on state autonomy limited the national governments authority quite significantly. The inherent weaknesses of the articles soon became apparent. The central government lacked the critical power to levy taxes, leading to chronic financial instability. Printing money was also outside its purview, further hindering its ability to address economic challenges. In addition, the articles did little to prevent disputes among the states regarding trade, land ownership, and other vital matters. These unresolved conflicts threatened the fragile unity of the newly formed nation. The constitutional convention initially convened to revise the articles of Confederation witnessed a more dramatic shift. James Madisons Virginia plan, introduced early on, proposed a complete overhaul creating a stronger central government. This deviated from the original intent of amending the articles, but ultimately fueled debate and compromise. The resulting document, as Benjamin Franklin acknowledged, wasnt ideal. It represented the best attainable solution at that time. Following its approval by the convention delegates, the constitution required ratification by individual states for national implementation. The constitutional convention, despite resulting in a ratified document, left two critical questions unresolved. These questions, central to the future course of the nation, were deliberately left open due to the inability to reach unanimous agreement. The first question concerned the balance of power between the federal government and individual states. Many delegates championed state sovereignty, believing that states should retain ultimate authority. Others advocated for the supremacy of the federal government. The second question dealt with the permanence of the union. A significant number of delegates, particularly from southern states, insisted on the right to secede from the union should it fail to serve their interests. The deliberate ambiguity surrounding these issues reflected a strategic compromise. Had the delegates attempted to definitively resolve them, the constitution might never have been ratified. This ambiguity set the stage for future political debates and ultimately became a primary factor in the outbreak of the civil war. We will continue to examine these unresolved questions throughout the course as they shaped much of american political history. So what did this new constitution do? We can understand it in a few ways. In this segment we are going to talk about federalism. In the next, we will explore the structure of the government it creates. What was the intention of the founders? And some reflection on how political reality differed from what the founders originally intended. Federalism is a fundamental principle that establishes a system of dual sovereignty. In simpler terms, there exist two distinct levels of government, the national government and the state governments. This national government, situated in Washington, DC, coexists with individual state governments like those in California, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Recall our previous discussions on the topic of national identity. Citizens primarily identified with their state or colony of origin. A resident of Massachusetts would consider themself a Massachusetts person and Massachusetts their country. Similarly, a Pennsylvanian would view Pennsylvania as their primary nation. Essentially, we have 13 distinct individual states united through an alliance operating under a central government with limited powers. This central governments function was to address issues beyond the capability of individual states. This concept of shared national identity, evolving alongside strong state loyalty, significantly influenced the founders approach to federalism. The Constitution, in their vision, served to define and restrict the federal governments authority. This emphasis on limitations reflected a desire to safeguard the autonomy of individual states, which many citizens viewed as their primary political identity. The concept of a supreme central government stems from the Constitution's supremacy clause. However, it's important to understand that this supremacy applies only within the federal government's designated areas of jurisdiction. The supremacy clause doesn't grant the federal government absolute power. Federal supremacy reigns in matters explicitly delegated to the national government, such as defense, war, foreign relations, and regulating interstate commerce. Conversely, the states retain control over a vast array of issues closer to home, including education, road construction, and local sales taxes. These spheres of influence are outlined, though not always definitively, within the Constitution. As we'll explore further, the lack of absolute specificity in defining these powers can lead to complexities. The United States was established as a federal republic. This signifies a system with two distinct levels of government, each possessing its own defined areas of authority or jurisdictions. The 10th Amendment, enshrined within the Bill of Rights, exemplifies this principle. It asserts that any powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people thereof. Federalism, as envisioned by the founders was a novel concept. Unlike traditional nation states with centralized power structures and subordinate provinces, the United States aimed to function as a cooperative union of individual states. This bears some resemblance to the European Union, where member states retain significant autonomy while collaborating under a central governing body. However, it is crucial to recognize a key distinction. Unlike the European Union, where authority is explicitly defined in its founding document, the American Constitution leaves some room for interpretation regarding the division of powers. This ambiguity, as we'll see, has led to ongoing debates and interpretations surrounding federalism throughout american history. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas. If you have any questions, you can post them in the open forum discussion or contact the professor using canvas email.",331

","Now we turn our attention to the structure of the federal government established by the constitution. This system divides the powers of government among three distinct the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Each branch plays a critical role in the governing process. The legislative branch, as its name suggests, is primarily responsible for crafting laws. It's the engine that generates the legal framework for our nation. The executive branch, on the other hand, take center stage in implementing those laws. It's the arm that carries out the will of the legislature and ensures the smooth functioning of government on a daily basis. The judicial branch occupies a unique position. Unlike the other two branches, its core function isn't explicitly defined in the Constitution. This ambiguity led to early debates concerning the power of the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary to interpret laws for the states. As we'll explore in future lectures, the concept of judicial review gradually emerged, solidifying the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutionality. In essence, the Supreme Court's pronouncements became the final word on what constitutes lawful and unlawful actions under the Constitution. So we have a system where the legislature proposes, the executive executes, and the judiciary interprets, with each branch serving as a check on the power of the others. This intricate system of checks and balances is a cornerstone of american democracy. The executive branch is presided over by the president, who holds the pivotal role of overseeing various departments, such as the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Commerce, among others. These departments collectively form the administrative apparatus through which the federal government operates. The president's primary responsibility, as mandated by the Constitution, is the enforcement of laws. The method by which the president is elected is distinctive utilizing a mechanism known as the electoral College. This system may have come to your attention during recent electoral disputes in states such as Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. These disputes were not predicated on the notion that the vote was narrowly contested in terms of the popular vote. Indeed, in the most recent election, there was a significant difference in the popular vote between the two principal candidates. However, the margin of victory within the electoral college was comparatively narrower. The electoral college is constituted based on a formula that includes the number of representatives a state has in the House of Representatives plus its two senators. This structure means that states like California have a significant number of electoral votes due to their large representation in the House, whereas states with minimal representation, such as Wyoming, have fewer electoral votes. In a presidential election, candidates present a slate of electors in each state who pledge to vote for them. The system in most states awards all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote within that state, a mechanism known as the winner takes all system. This can result in a scenario where a candidate who wins the popular vote nationally may not win the presidency if they do not secure a majority of the electoral votes. The requirement for a majority, as opposed to a plurality, is crucial. In the electoral college, a majority necessitates more than half of the electoral votes, while a plurality is merely the largest share of votes that does not need to surpass the halfway mark. This distinction underscores the potential for a candidate to ascend to the presidency without winning the majority of the popular vote, a situation that has occurred in several instances throughout american history. The experiences and philosophical inclinations of the founders led them to harbor concerns about concentrating too much power in any single entity, whether it be a central government or the populace at large. Their weariness of a strong central government stemmed from their adverse experiences with the british parliament, while their fear of populist rule was fueled by the unruly mob actions that precipitated the constitutional convention. This dual concern motivated the drafters to devise a system that would mitigate these risks by introducing a mediating layer between the election of the president and the will of the people. The electoral college was conceived as this buffer aimed at preventing the direct election of a president by the populace. The underlying fear was that without such a mediating mechanism, the public might be swayed by momentary passions or manipulated by demagogues, leading to the election of unqualified or unsuitable candidates. To illustrate, imagine a scenario in which, in a wave of national disillusionment with politics, the electorate decides and masks to vote for a purely symbolic or facetious candidate, such as a well known cartoon character. The electoral college in this construct serves as a safeguard that would theoretically prevent the installation of such a candidate into the presidency irrespective of the popular vote. This mechanism allows electors the discretion to override the popular choice if deemed necessary for the nation's well being. Historically, this aspect of the electoral college has come into play in various forms, as seen in attempts to influence or change electors votes in recent elections. Such maneuvers underscore the electoral college's role as a check on the direct power of the electorate over the executive branch, embodying the founders intent to balance democratic participation with a safeguard against potential excesses of direct democracy. It is important to note that while there have been electors who changed their votes, referred to as faithless electors in various elections, no national election has ever been decided by faithless electors. The primary rationale behind the electoral college's creation was to ensure a moderated and deliberative process for electing the president, reflecting a profound concern for both the stability of the republic and the prevention of tyranny. Whether originating from a monarch or a mob, the secondary rationale behind the establishment of the electoral college relates to the framers vision of the United States as a federation of states, each possessing a degree of autonomy and influence over national affairs. This perspective is rooted in the constitutional principle that the president should be elected through a process that reflects the states role in the federal structure rather than through a direct popular vote. An intriguing aspect of the US constitution is its provision allowing states considerable leeway in determining the method for selecting electors. Initially, this flexibility meant that in the first presidential election, electors were predominantly appointed by state legislatures rather than being chosen through a popular vote. This arrangement underscored the notion that the election of the president was a matter for the states to decide, reflecting their sovereign status within the union. It was only subsequently that states began to establish laws prescribing the election of electors by the people, a shift that gradually democratized the process. However, the constitution's original language maintains the states prerogative to decide how electors are chosen, a testament to the enduring importance of federalism in the american political system. The office of the president is defined by a four year term with the possibility of re election. Notably, the constitution originally imposed no limit on the number of terms a president could serve. This absence of a term limit led to the establishment of a two term tradition by George Washington, who voluntarily stepped down after his second term. This precedent of relinquishing power after two terms persisted until Franklin D. Roosevelts four elections to the presidency. In the 1930s and early 1940s, in response to Roosevelt's unprecedented tenure, the constitution was amended to restrict the presidency to two consecutive terms, reinforcing the principle of periodic leadership renewal. As a safeguard for democracy, the primary function of the legislature is to create laws. However, the structure of this branch is unique. The United States Congress is considered bicameral, meaning it consists of two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate. This bicameral structure emerged from a key debate during the constitutional convention. One faction argued for a unicameral legislature with equal representation for each state. This approach ensured that the voice of each state, regardless of size, would be heard. However, others countered that such a system would give undue power to less populous states, effectively diminishing the influence of larger states and their citizens. Imagine, for instance, that Delaware had the same number of representatives as Virginia. In this scenario, the people of Virginia would have considerably less influence on the government compared to their counterparts in Delaware. On the other hand, a legislature based solely on population would overwhelm the voices of citizens in smaller states. Delaware, with its significantly smaller population compared to Virginia, would find its voice drowned out. The solution crafted by the founding fathers was a bicameral legislature that incorporated elements of both proposals. The House of Representatives reflects population distribution. The number of representatives allotted to each state is directly tied to its population, ensuring a proportional voice for more populated states. To maintain this balance, a census is conducted every ten years to determine any necessary adjustments in representation. This explains the recent census and the potential for states like California to gain or lose representatives based on population shifts. The Senate, however, takes a different approach. Originally, senators were not elected by the people, but rather appointed by state legislatures or governors. This system ensured that the interests of the states themselves were directly represented within the federal government. In simpler terms, the Senate champions the interests of the states as a whole, while the House champions the interests of the people. The 17th amendment, ratified in 1913, changed how senators are chosen. Today, senators are directly elected by the people within their respective states and serve six year terms with the possibility of re election. Similarly, members of the House serve two year terms with the opportunity to be re elected by their constituents. There are no term limits for either senators or representatives. As long as they continue to win elections, they can serve in Congress indefinitely. This might explain the presence of some senators well into their eighties and nineties. The judiciary holds the responsibility of determining whether laws passed by the legislative branch and actions taken by the executive branch comply with the supreme law of the land, the Constitution. This power is central to the concept of checks and balances within the american political system. Federal judges, including those on the Supreme Court, are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Unlike elected officials in the other branches, federal judges enjoy lifetime tenure. They serve until they retire, pass away, or are removed from office through impeachment. The recent passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Antonin Scalia exemplify this. We had also seen instances of retirement, such as that of Justice John Paul Stevens, and resignation, like that of Justice Anthony Kennedy. While the judiciary may not garner the daily spectacle associated with the legislative or executive branches, its power is arguably the most consequential. Judicial pronouncements hold significant weight. There are only two ways a judicial decision can be overturned. The court itself can reverse its stance, though this is uncommon, or the Constitution can be amended. A complex and challenging process. In essence, the judiciary acts as the silent guardian of the constitution, ensuring that the other branches function within the boundaries established by this foundational document. Their rulings have the potential to shape the course of the nation, making the judiciary a vital pillar of american democracy. Consider, in the original design of the federal government, only a single branch, the House of Representatives, was directly elected by the people. Why this limited mandate? The founding fathers harbored a degree of distrust towards the general populace. Fearing the inherent volatility of an unrestrained majority, there was genuine concern that placing too much power in the hands of the people could lead to societal instability and undermine the fledgling government. This philosophy was heavily inspired by the writings of John Locke, particularly his emphasis on the protection of property rights. The prevailing belief among the founders was twofold. Firstly, only property owners had a true stake in the nation, as articulated in Locke's work, and secondly, that ownership fosters a sense of responsibility and aligns individual interests with the broader interests of the country. Conversely, those lacking property might prioritize their own well being over that of the nation. This deliberate structure, with limited direct input from the citizenry, was further reinforced by the complex system of checks and balances we see embedded in our constitution. Understand, this was no accident. Imagine introducing a new law. It must laboriously navigate committees, pass through both legislative chambers, reconcile potential discrepancies, earn presidential approval, and even then face legal challenges in the courts. Efficient, certainly not effective at preventing any single individual or faction from exercising undue power. Absolutely. The fear the founding fathers held was not limited to the potential excesses of the people, but also to the potential tyranny of a centralized government. Their own experience with british rule had shown that efficiency often came at the cost of individual liberty. Hitlers regime exemplified a chillingly effective government where commands were carried out with unquestioning obedience. The american system, while often frustratingly slow, was designed as a safeguard against such unchecked power. When we hear criticisms of gredlock in Washington, it's important to remember that this was exactly the outcome the founders envisioned. They embrace the idea that the government which governs least, governs best. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","In this segment, we will discuss politics during the first years. Under the Constitution, the newly elected president will attempt to establish a unity government, only to be thwarted by cabinet members with vastly differing visions of what kind of nation the constitution created. We will see how the divisions in the first administration became the basis for american politics even into the present. George Washington was elected president, the first to hold this office. Without an established precedent for presidential conduct, Washington's leadership initially resembled that of a benevolent monarch. Let's consider the traditional role of a king. Theoretically, a king represents and protects his people, serving as a paternal figure. Washington, aware of his unique position, stated his intention to represent all Americans, not just those who supported him. Despite his widespread popularity, this would prove challenging. In forming his cabinet, Washington strategically selected individuals with divergent viewpoints. Alexander Hamilton became secretary of the treasury and Thomas Jefferson secretary of state. While once allies, their visions for America had grown increasingly distinct. Hamilton believed the Constitution established a strong national government capable of guiding the United States towards becoming a powerful commercial and industrial rival to Britain. Conversely, Jefferson envisioned a nation where citizens could enjoy peace, freedom, and autonomy on their land with minimal governmental interference. These deep seated differences sparked intense and often bitter debates between Hamilton and Jefferson within the Washington administration. This schism highlights two fundamentally opposing visions of America, a tension that persists in american politics today. We can frame this divide as a conflict between economics and ideology. On one side, Hamiltonians believed federal policies should foster economic might and national wealth. Conversely, Jeffersonians envision a government primarily focused on safeguarding individual liberties and rights, enabling citizens to pursue their own livelihoods with limited federal oversight. In the early years of the republic, these positions were seen as irreconcilable. Hamiltons supporters view Jeffersonians as dangerous radicals, citing Jefferson's own statements about the potential need for another revolution. Those following Jefferson saw Hamiltonians as cryptomonarchists, individuals intent on undermining the Constitution to reestablish a system akin to the british one they had fought to escape. Both sides feared a victory by the other would spell ruin for the nation, leading to an atmosphere where compromise seemed impossible. The ideological split we've discussed crystallized into the first american party system. Those who aligned with Hamilton became known as federalists. It's crucial to distinguish these federalists from those who supported ratification of the Constitution. During the ratification debates, federalists advocated for the Constitution, while anti federalists opposed it. In the first party system, federalists champion a strong central government with an emphasis on economic development, while those who followed Jefferson, now termed democratic Republicans, lean towards a more idealistic vision, prioritizing individual liberties. Let's outline their core beliefs. Federalists, including figures like Washington and John Adams, supported a robust central government, believing it essential for building a powerful commercial and industrial nation. Democratic Republicans such as Madison and Monroe argued that any strong government should exist at the state level, allowing states to counterbalance federal power or even withdraw from the union if necessary. Economically, democratic Republicans envision an agrarian republic. While many were indeed southern, their ideal was not the plantation system, but rather a society of prosperous, independent small farmers. A vision well explore further when we discuss the concept of yeoman farmers. While federalist support was concentrated in the commercially oriented northeast, democratic republican support predominated in the south but was not exclusive to it. The fledgling american republic emerged amidst a complex international landscape. The American Revolution had ignited a wider conflict between Britain and France, and both european powers sought to draw the United States into their orbit. Federalists, with their focus on economic prosperity, gravitated towards Britain, the dominant trading partner at the time. While they aspired to future competition with Britain, immediate economic interests dictated a cautious approach. Disrupting trade with Britain could be disastrous. Conversely, democratic Republicans, steeped in revolutionary ideals, felt a kinship with France. Witnessing the French Revolution firsthand, Jefferson even participated in it. They saw it as an extension of the american fight for liberty. They envisioned a global wave of revolutions overthrowing tyranny, and the United States, they believed, should play a role in promoting this cause. This stance stemmed from ideology, not economic considerations. The Democratic Republicans embraced a philosophy known as strict constructionism. They believed the Constitution explicitly outlined federal powers, and any actions not expressly permitted were prohibited. The first major test of this principle arose with Hamiltons financial plan. As treasury secretary, he proposed establishing a national bank and having the federal government assume state debts incurred during the revolution. This aimed to bolster the nation's creditworthiness. However, strict constructionists found no constitutional provision authorizing a national bank or federal debt assumption. To them, these actions were unconstitutional. Federalists countered this argument by invoking the elastic clause, also called the necessary and proper clause. This clause allows Congress to pass laws deemed necessary to to carry out its enumerated powers. Federalists asserted that establishing a national bank and assuming state debts, while not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, were actions necessary and proper for ensuring a sound and stable government. This fundamental debate, whether the Constitution is a fixed document or a living one adaptable to changing circumstances, persists in american politics. Originally, Jeffersonians advocated for strict constructionism. All Hamiltonians favored a looser interpretation. Today, the battle lines are less clear cut. Consider modern issues like same sex marriage, gun rights, and abortion rights. None are explicitly addressed in the Constitution, yet courts and lawmakers have rendered decisions based on their interpretation, demonstrating the continued relevance of this foundational debate. Having surveyed the debates at the constitutional convention and the difficulty in coming to agreement, we will notice that one of the strongest arguments in favor of so called strict constructionism in contemporary politics is based on a myth. That myth is that we should interpret the constitution based on the founders original intent. There is no single identifiable original intent to study historical records to try to find it reveals that each of the participants in the convention had their own intent. The intent of each state was distinct from that of the others. What this means is that proposals as to original intent represent more the intent of the interpreter than that of the founders.

","George Washington's decision to step down after two terms as president of the United States in 1796 established a precedent that would endure for well over a century until the ratification of the 22nd amendment in 1951. Recognizing the significance of this moment, Washington chose to deliver a farewell address to the nation. While not a spoken address but a written document, it served as a final message from the father of our country, offering parting advice for the future of the young republic. Though Alexander Hamilton assisted in the writing of the farewell address, the content undoubtedly reflected Washington's own convictions. The address addressed two key the dangers of political factionalism and the appropriate course for american foreign policy. Having witnessed the bitter partisan battles that arose during his own presidency, particularly between the Federalists led by Hamilton, and the democratic Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, Washington warned against the divisive nature of political parties. He believed such factions could threaten national unity. Furthermore, Washington laid the groundwork for a principle that would guide american foreign policy for much of the 19th century. Avoiding permanent entanglements in european affairs, he advocated for a policy of neutrality in the conflicts raging between european powers, such as the ongoing struggle between Britain and France. However, Washington also stressed the importance of maintaining strong commercial ties with all nations, emphasizing the benefits of free trade for the young american economy. John Adams, the second president of the United States, was elected in 1796. In the context of the electoral college system at the time, the candidate receiving the most electoral votes became president, while the runner up became vice president. This unique system, later amended by the 12th Amendment in 1804, resulted in a situation where Adams, a the Federalist, found himself serving alongside his main political rival, Thomas Jefferson, a democratic Republican. Their ideological differences created a tense political environment. The 1796 election was indeed a bitterly contested one, marked by vicious personal attacks in the press. It's instructive to compare this historical example, where Jefferson was depicted as a puppet of the devil, undermining the government, to more recent elections where similar tactics have been employed. This comparison highlights a certain continuity in american political discourse, raising questions about the evolution of political stability. The presidential election of 1800 marked a turning point in american political history. Often termed the Revolution of 1800, the election pitted incumbent John Adams against Thomas Jefferson once again, with Adams ultimately failing to secure a majority in the electoral college. Jefferson, too, did not achieve a clear majority due to a tie with Aaron Burr. As stipulated by the constitution. A deadlocked electoral college meant the election would be decided by the house of representatives. With each state delegation casting a single vote, the federalist controlled House reached an impasse. While they could not support the re election of Adams, they were equally opposed to electing either Jefferson or Burr, both staunch democratic Republicans. This stalemate brought the nation to the brink of a constitutional crisis. The governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia threatened to call up their state militias to install Jefferson, a scenario that would have gravely undermined the very foundations of american democracy. Faced with imminent chaos, Jefferson found himself in the difficult position of negotiating a compromise with his bitter political rival, Alexander Hamilton, the agreement denied by both men until their debts secured Jefferson's presidency in exchange for maintaining the federalist financial system. This crucial moment underscores the potential fragility of a young democracy and the absolute necessity of compromise. A failure to find common ground would have undermined the fundamental principles of the american republic. The events of 1800 offer a timeless lesson in a functioning democracy. Even the most ardent adversaries must be willing to seek compromise to ensure the nation's progress. We will analyze the intricacies of this pivotal election and its far reaching implications in more detail in a later lecture. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on canvas.

","I'd like for you guys to remember what was the last thing we talked about last Monday? Somebody tell me the revolution of 1800. What was the revolution of 1800? On my notes, I had written down that it was Adams versus Jefferson, and then the electoral college got split between Jefferson and Burr. And then the election ended up going to the house. Exactly. Exactly. And what, how did, how was the election finally resolved? You're absolutely right on it, Sean. There was a compromise that led to the election of Jefferson. Okay. All right. And the compromise was between who and who? You're right. Absolutely. Jefferson. And who was his great antagonist? Hamilton. Hamilton, exactly. Do you guys remember, this is important. You should remember this. Right. The first party system. This was the way that the different visions of the country split themselves apart during the Washington administration. So if you remember, Hamilton was secretary of the treasury, Jefferson was secretary of state. But they had very different visions. The country. And that Hamilton thought that the country should be a great industrial, commercial power, and Jefferson thought it should be a landscape of liberty. He was more idealistic. And so then we saw that that led to two different views. On the one hand, the people that followed Hamilton were known as federalists. They were mostly in the northeast because that was really the industrial center of the United States. Some of the most more famous federalists were Washington and Adams, and they wanted a strong central government so that they could encourage commerce and industry. And then they wanted to enact plans that weren't particularly specified in the constitution, like a national bank. And so they, they thought that the constitution was a. Like a framework that could be added to. Okay, you guys remember this? Questions? Comments? Okay, because I'm going to come back and I'm going to ask you again. And, you know, these long, pregnant silences are kind of uncomfortable for everybody, so you should be able to answer these questions. Right. All right, so next, then we have the people that followed Jefferson were democratic Republicans, is what they call themselves sometimes just Republicans. Some of the more famous of them were Madison and Monroe. You'll hopefully recall that James Madison was the one who really kind of encouraged or promoted the new constitution. They believe that the government, the government, that if there should be any government at all, it should be closer to the people. So they thought the state should be supreme in the federal system. And they also believe that the Constitution was specific in the powers that it granted to the federal government. It couldn't be. Couldn't be. What's the word I'm looking for? It couldn't be. It couldn't be broken. You could only go by what the constitution said and nothing else. Right. Now, let me just make kind of an observation about legal practice today, and that will be that there are still people who call themselves strict constructionists and loose constructionists. And when we look at the court system today, the federal court system and the Supreme Court, it is the more conservative justices who call themselves strict constructionists. Okay. Now. And then it's more liberal justices that say, no, the Constitution is a living document that needs, that can be, that can be interpreted to mean things that weren't intended actually originally. Like, for example, same sex marriage. Same sex marriage wasn't something that was an issue in 1787. So it wasn't in the Constitution. But loose constructionists will say, yeah, well, we could find that right in the constitution because it evolved, whereas strict constructionists would say, well, it's not in the Constitution, so you can't say anything about it. You guys get what I'm saying? You guys follow that? Questions? Comments? All right. Well, this is important, really, in terms of what it's important to be a citizen. Now, most of the Republicans, but not all of them were in the south. There were some Republicans in, like, for example, Pennsylvania. Right. And New York. Actually, Aaron Burr was from New York. Right. But the difference in terms of the economy between the two was that Jefferson believed in an agricultural economy but not a plantation economy. Right. So even though the south was a plantation economy, vision of his, of his country wasn't plantation agriculture but single family farms, which is something that we're going to talk about here in just a few minutes. All right. So you guys get the difference between the two, the split between the two, right. And I think that I may have already mentioned and that we'll continue to look at the split actually really can be boiled down to a country that is an economic powerhouse or a country that is a bastion of liberty, a kind of a, what's the word I'm looking for? More of a beacon of liberty. Right. And keep in mind that we talked about the liberal revolution, the idea that the united, the american revolution was the beginning of this revolution of liberty that would be spread throughout the world. So the United States was a, a revolutionary government that exported revolution around the world. Okay. Questions? Comments? Can we think of any countries that are like that today, any countries that are trying to export revolution? I'm not sure if this country applies, but Hong Kong, I believe, well, they are struggling for democracy, but they're not trying to export revolution. Okay. When we think about a country that's, that's trying to export revolution, generally, speaking, most countries that are more conservative will be very much against them. Right. And I'm not saying that because you do export revolution. That's a good thing. Right. But I do. I do think that there's at least one country today that's very heavily involved in the idea of spreading revolution. Iran. Iran. Exactly. Iran is trying to spread its islamic revolution. Right. So the way that countries of the world looked at the United States then, is very much the way that the countries of the world look at Iran today. You guys follow what I'm saying? Okay, I know that's uncomfortable for you, but that's just to kind of emphasize to you how radical the american experiment was at that time. Okay. Questions? Comments about any of that? Okay, let's go a little bit further now, and let's think about the relationship between Hamilton and Jefferson. Hamilton and Jefferson almost went to fistfights in the White House during the Washington administration, and they came to really despise each other and the people that followed Hamilton came to despise the people that followed Jefferson and vice versa. Right. So it was not. Okay, well, you guys believe one thing and we believe something else, but we all believe that were good Americans. It was the people who were the Hamiltonians or the federalists thought that the democratic Republicans were a bunch of wild eyed liberals. Wild eyed revolutionaries. Right. And the Democratic Republicans thought that the federalists were a bunch of monarchists. Okay, now let's try to put that in contemporary terms. What that would mean would be that the democratic Republicans thought that the federalists were Nazis and the federalists thought that the democratic Republicans were communists. Okay? They didn't have Nazis and communists back then, but it was the same kind of split. Do you guys get what I'm saying here? Questions? Comments? And so then the idea here wasn't that if we lose the election, well, that's too bad. We'll come back next time and try again. The idea was that if the country continues under the rule of either side, depending on which side you're on, it's the end. The country's going to end. Right. So Jefferson believed that because of the kind of monarchist tendencies of the federalists, that it might be. Might be necessary for there to be a new revolution. And Hamilton, the people that followed Hamilton believed that if Jefferson took over, it would be the end of the country. He would sell the country out to the French. You see what I'm saying? So when there was this election in 1800 between Jefferson and Adams. Okay, so Jefferson ran. Hamilton didn't run. He was more like a kind of a background figure, but he was the really chief of the Federalists. But Adams ran against Jefferson. Right. And we see then these two very different visions of the country coming up for a vote. Okay? And the outcome of the election was that the Federalists would never win according to the. According to the constitution, because Adams didn't get as many electors as either Jefferson or his running mate, Aaron Burr. So the outcome of the election had to be either Jefferson or Burr. But we'll recall that because they didn't, nobody got a majority, that the election went to the house and the house was controlled by federalists. And so what ended up happening was that there was a stalemate in the house where. Where they kept taking votes, and this over a period of about a month. And they kept taking votes and the votes always came out the same. It was a tie between Jefferson and Burr. And Adams came in third every time. Right? So the way that. That. Well, eventually what ended up happening was that the republican governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania threatened to call up the troops to install Jefferson as president. And the outcome of that, essentially was that Jefferson and Hamilton made a secret deal. And the secret deal was that Jefferson would be elected president and then Jefferson would leave in place the federalist financial system, which included the national bank, which was something that the democratic Republicans thought was completely unconstitutional. But they made this hard compromise, and Jefferson then was elected president. And so the election of 1800, which was the first time that there was a change in the kind of direction of the government was handed, was accomplished peacefully without any bloodshed. Now, when we look at that, we say, well, that's no big deal. I mean, that happens all the time. It has always happened in american history, and it's almost always true. But. But this was the first time that that had ever happened that it was possible. Whenever there was one party in power and the other party gained power, then there was always bloodshed to determine who was going to win, right? And although this was really, they didn't really have this experience with democracy, but if we look later at the latin american revolutions, at the revolution in Mexico and Argentina and anywhere, and even in France, right, when they have the revolution there, the idea was that when one party, when there's an election and the party in power loses the election, then they always declared the election to be a fraud and they ended up fighting it out. Right? And then the result of that was that the vote really didn't matter. It was just a prelude to a war that happened every election. You guys get what I'm saying, but that didn't happen in the United States. And what that means is that the United States proved that it was possible for democracy to work. That's the example of the validity of democracy. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So this is an incredibly important event in world history that the United States was able to survive this crisis of elections. And what happens then to these two different visions of the United States is that this becomes the big question for american politics from then all the way through. So the question really here is going to be between, I think, economics and idealism, right. And instead of fighting it out in the streets, people fight it out in the ballot boxes. Right. And so as we go through american history, we can see that sometimes the people who are. Who are promoting a strong economy are triumphant, and sometimes the people who are more liberal are triumphant, but it goes back and forth, and it's always a peaceful transfer between them. You guys get what I'm saying? So what the election of 1800 did was it institutionalized that conflict between the two visions of the country. And that's why those two visions of the country are still there today. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? That some people think that the United States should exercise its power for the benefit of the american economy, and some people think that the United States should be a beacon of freedom, liberty and justice. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about any of this? So this is the basis, then, for american politics. And it's also the proof that democracy can work. Although I have to say, and I've mentioned this before, that this happens in America, in the United States at 1800, doesn't happen anywhere else for the next 75 years. For the next 75 years, whenever there's an election where one party loses control to another, they always fight it out everywhere that you look. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about that? What do you guys think? Any questions? Comments? Yeah, I have a quick question. Okay, good. So would the threat of military action if Jefferson wasn't put in power, would that sort of be like if today, like if the Capitol invasion would have just been a threat, or was it kind of a different idea? Okay, so the difference between what happened this year and what happened then is that essentially what happened this year was an extra judicial mob, meaning that it wasn't organized by any government. Okay. There were organizations involved, but it was outside the government. And where we saw in the election of 1800, we had governments that were actually raising militia to accomplish this. You see the difference? But the idea essentially is the same. The idea is that if you don't like the outcome of the election, then you use force to overturn it. Do you see what I'm saying? Although I will say that what happened this year was that people were against what happened. The people that invaded the capital were against the outcome of the revolution of the election, and the armies in 1800 were in favor of the change of power. You guys get what I'm saying? You get what I'm saying? So those are the differences. Yeah. But anytime, anytime that you want to use force to overturn the will of the people, that would be something that would be a threat to democracy. Okay. Thank you. And it really sets a bad example for the democratic system, a bad precedent. All right. Questions, comments? That's a good question, Sean. Thank you. Any other questions.",411

","Okay, now let's talk about. Well, when Jefferson came into power, was he the wild eyed radical that he had been portrayed as? And the answer is no. He was. He did change the direction of the government a little bit. Right. By some of the things that had done, that had happened during the Washington and Adams administrations. He will change direction on. Right. So one thing that happened was that the Washington administration had raised excise taxes. Basically, the idea here was they raised taxes on produced goods. And there was an argument about whether the federal government could actually raise taxes on goods. The way that it was thought to be was that the federal government could raise taxes on states, but not on individual goods. Right. And the big example of this was the. When you read in the book about the whiskey rebellion, that's what that was about. That they raised the excise tax on the production of whiskey in western Pennsylvania. And the whiskey distillers rebelled, said they weren't going to pay the tax, at which point then Washington raised an army and went and marched on western Pennsylvania and put down the rebellion. And the federal excise taxes stayed. But now when Jefferson comes into power, he's going to abolish them. Okay. Because he says the federal government shouldn't have that much power. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, then the next one. Allow the alien and sedition acts to. To expire. This has to do with foreign intervention in american politics. Does this sound familiar? Right. Okay. And the idea here is that, as you guys will recall, I mentioned that there was a conflict, major conflict, between Britain and France. And both Britain and France were trying to get the United States on their side. And there were people in the United States that were in favor of both sides. If we look at, for example, Adams had really seen France as the great enemy, and then we see Jefferson, who sees England as the great enemy. But what happened was that both of those countries tried to interfere in american politics. And the response of the federalist administration, particularly Adams, was to prevent. Prevent. Well, there was a plan. The French had decided that what they were going to do was send a whole bunch of people to America to become citizens so they could vote in favor of France. And so to counteract that, the alien law was passed. The Alien act basically said that in order to become an american citizen, you have to be here for 15 years. Okay? So that kept that kind of squashed, that idea of the French taking over the american government from the. Basically from within. Okay. But the democratic Republicans thought that this was a federal overreach, that the federal government shouldn't be, shouldn't have that much power. And then the one that really rankled them was the sedition act, which basically said anybody that criticizes the president is guilty of sedition and can be thrown in jail and fined. Right. And this was seen as kind of almost like a monarchical measure. And that is going to expire during Jefferson's administration because Jefferson doesn't think that the federal government should have that much power. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about that?",412
67,"US1: 413 -US2: 413
","All right, so now, this is another very important topic, and it has to do with the judiciary. And you'll recall last week, when we talked about the structure of the federal government, that the judiciary is one of the three branches. But when they wrote the constitution, it wasn't really clear what the purpose of the judiciary was. Okay. And. And the one of the reasons why it wasn't really clear was because it wasn't clear that the federal government had the right to interpret the constitution. Okay? There were, as you guys will recall, I said there were a number of states that believed that they should be the final word on what was constitutional and what wasn't. And basically that if the states saw that a federal law was against their interest, they could just ignore it or they could nullify it. Right? And so we have this. This background conflict of those who believe in the supremacy of the federal government and those who believe in the supremacy of the state government. Right. And into the middle of this, we come with John Adams. John Adams, when he leaves office, basically decides to pack the courts with federalist judges. And so they pass the Federalist Congress, as one of its last measures, is going to expand the judiciary so that the federal court system, so that essentially, that Adams can. Can appoint a number of federalists to the judiciary, which will mean that the federalists at least have control of one branch of the government. Okay, so those people who think, oh, well, the Supreme Court and the court system is supposed to be non political. Well, it's always been political. Right. And the reason why it's always been political is because the justices or judges in the judicial system are all appointed by the president, and the president is political. You guys get what I'm saying? But the kind of the caveat there is that once the. Once a person has been appointed to the judiciary, they serve for life. So if you appoint somebody that, say, in their forties or fifties, they could serve for 2030 years. Right. Whereas the president can only serve for four years at a time, and, congressman, only two. Right. You follow what I'm saying? All right, so. So these political appointments to the judiciary have long term effects. That's one of the things that. One of the things that we'll notice as we go forward in your lifetimes is going to be that essentially, the Trump administration was able to do almost the same thing that Adams did. What really happened was that the Republicans refused to confirm nominees to the court until Trump was president. And then once he was president, they filled the court system with very conservative justices. And those conservative justices are gonna be on the court for 20 or 30 years. You guys follow what I'm saying? So this is gonna have a long term effect. All right? I'm not saying it's gonna be a good effect or bad effect. I'm just saying that's gonna have a long term effect. Right? Okay. So what happens then is that Adams appoints a number of justices right at the end of his term. This is where we come up with the term lame duck. You've heard of lame duck before, right? Lame duck. A lame duck is somebody that is still in power but is not going to be reelected. Right? So the last two months of Trump's term were the Islam duck period. Right. And the lame duck period is a politically safe zone because you can do things without having to pay a political price. Right? And this is when you'll see presidents start to pardon people. It's not just presidents. I mean, governors and people like that. Right? They'll pardon people that are unpopular, things like that, because they know they don't have to pay a political price for it. Okay. And so one of the things that. That Adams does is during this lame duck period, he makes a number of appointments, a lot. A large number of appointments to the judicial. And. And he was, he was busy doing it all the way up until midnight on the day that Jefferson was going to be inaugurated. Okay. And so they. So they. Sorry. So they called these judges midnight judges, right. Because they were still signing their commissions at midnight. But once midnight had passed, they could no longer sign those commissions. Right. And so there was a guy, and his name was Marbury. I always forget his first name. It may have been James, but I'm not sure. Anyway, Marbury was appointed to a position of justice of the peace in Maryland by the Adams administration, but his commission was never signed. Sorry. And when Jefferson became president, he told his secretary of state, James Madison, to stop signing him. Stop signing the commissions. And then the Judiciary act, where they expanded the judiciary in 1801, was repealed by the new Republican Congress. Democratic Republican Congress. And so all of those new judge positions that had been created are now rescinded. They're not there anymore. Right. And so what had really happened here was that this guy Marbury had been promised a job by the federal government, but he never got the job because they never signed the commission. And so he sued in court, and it made its way through the court system until it got to the Supreme Court. Okay? And what happened in the Supreme Court was that the Supreme Court ruled that Marbury should have gotten his job, but that the court didn't have jurisdiction. So it sounds like a weird kind of outcome, because really, if you think about it, Jefferson really, in a way, lost. But he also won. I mean, the guy, Marbury, never got the job, so that way. But he lost in a bigger way because what it did was set the precedent for the Supreme Court to be the final judge of what's constitutional and what isn't, the Supreme Court versus the state. And so this really gives an enormous amount of power to the federal government through the Supreme Court. You follow what I'm saying here? Because that's the tradition. That's where we come up with our idea, the tradition of judicial review. Judicial review means that the Supreme Court basically is the final arbiter of what is constitutional and what isn't, and it's not the states. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying here? So this is an important incident, right, in this case, Marbury versus Madison. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying here. Questions, comments? Now, Marshall, John Marshall, was Tom's cousin, but they didn't agree politically. And one of the things that you will notice is that Marshall was on the court until 1835. Jefferson was in office until 1808. So you can see Marshall was put on the court by Adams, and he stayed there for 34 years, whereas both Adams and Jefferson were dead while Marshall was still on the court. You guys get what I'm saying? So this is the effect of the, these appointments to the federal court system. You guys follow me here. And that's why, that's why so many people, when there is an election, people start talking about, well, if so and so becomes president, they're going to do something such and such to the court system, and that will have a long term effect. That's why it's so important. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about any of this.",413

","Okay, let's go on now. I'm going to talk a little bit now about the different visions. I'm going to talk particularly about Jefferson's vision of the country. Jefferson's vision is that the model citizen in the United States should be a single family farmer. The idea was to create an agrarian middle class, a middle class of farmers who would raise enough on their farm to support themselves and their families and have a little bit left over to sell so they could buy luxuries. And so the idea here isn't that somebody is going to be incredibly prosperous. I should say they're not going to be rich, but they will be prosperous and they'll be comfortable. And the idea then is that they can live out on their farms and they can live their kind of middle class lives and they would not have to worry about politics and they wouldn't have to worry about world affairs and they could just enjoy their liberty. You guys follow me here. That's the idea. Okay. The idea is that, is that the, the country, the ideal citizen would be a landowner. Jefferson called it a yeoman farmer. That's y e o m a n. But what he really means is a land, a single family farmer who owns the land. Well, why is it so important for them to own the land? The answer to that is because if you own the land, then you're more likely to care for it. Okay, so the idea really comes from the greek city states going all the way back to, you know, BC, right, where, for example, in Athens or in Sparta, you could vote. There was a democracy there, but you could only vote if you owned land. And the reason why was because if you owned land, that meant that the welfare of the city state was the same as your own welfare. So the idea here is that if you own part of the country, then the country's welfare is the same as your welfare. It's kind of like if you, if you go out, if you have a car, if you own a car, you don't want somebody to puke in it. But if you rent a car, you don't care if somebody pukes in it because you don't have it, you don't care about it, right? And it's the same thing here with tea. So when, when Hamilton thought that people should be, people should be, you know, working in industry, well, those industrial, the industry is going to be in the cities, right? And in the cities, they're not going to own the land. They're going to rent their tenements, whatever they, they live in apartments or whatever, right? And. And because they rent, they don't care. They don't care about the. The only care about is their own interests. You. You're following me here, right? So Jefferson thought that if we had a country that was made up of landowners, that they would act in favor of the country and that would create a republic of virtue. We call it a republic of virtue. And the virtue is built in because of your own self interest. Your self interest is the same as the state's self interest. You guys get what I say? All right, so that's going to be Jefferson's idea. And that means then that, well, we have to have a lot of land, okay? Because if everybody's going to be a farmer, there's got to be land. Okay, guys, with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so let's talk, then about the Louisiana purchase. Okay? Now let's think about America in 18. That's when Jefferson was elected president, actually, 1801. Right. And most of the people in the country lived here along the eastern seaboard. Right? But a number of people were moving into the Ohio river valley. Okay, we have talked about the Ohio river valley before because that's where the war, the seven, the french and indian war was really begun by. By George Washington. But the people in the Ohio river valley made a living from farming. They grew corn and they would sell their product in the east. But what was the product? Did they actually sell corn? Were they selling popcorn or. What was it. What did they do to the corn before they sold it? It would turn it into something. Remember I told you just a minute ago about the rebellion in western Pennsylvania? What was that rebellion? Whiskey. Whiskey, exactly. So they. They would turn the corn into whiskey, and then they would sell it in the east. But unlike today, it was very difficult to get from the Ohio river valley to the east because of the mountains. And so it was much easier for the farmers in. In this area to load their whiskey on barges that would go down the Ohio river and then down the Mississippi river. And then they would put their. Their goods on the docks in New Orleans. So they had what was called right of deposit, meaning they could deposit their goods on the docks in New Orleans and then in New Orleans, american trading vessels could pick up the cargo and bring it to the east. And it was much easier to do that than it was to try to drag all that stuff over the mountains because there weren't any roads. Okay. It was basically, you had to drag everything. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? All right. So the problem is going to be this in 18 France. See this. This area. Let me go back further. In the seven years war, remember that France had previously owned this land, actually, all of this land, but they lost it in the french and indian war. Seven years war. And this. Remember, this part was under the rule of the British, and this part was under the rule of the Spanish. But in 1803, France invaded Spain, and as a result of that, they acquired Louisiana. Okay? The reason why they acquired Louisiana was because there was this. They were trying to reestablish a slave trade in a. In a little island called phantoming, which is where Haiti is today. And when you have plantation agriculture like they had in. In Haiti or in Saint Domingue, you don't actually grow food there. And so what happened was that France, under Napoleon, had acquired Louisiana so that he could grow food to. To feed the slaves in Saint Domingue. Okay? And that was in 1801. Okay, here's the problem that the. The French. Well, first off, let me just go here, right? When the French took over this territory, they closed the Mississippi to american commerce, and the. They revoked Americans right of deposit, which meant that the farmers then in western Pennsylvania had nowhere to sell their products, and that meant that this was a real economic crisis for them. Okay? In the meantime, the attempt by the French to reestablish slavery in Saint Domingue is going to fail. And so it will happen then that after acquiring Louisiana, Napoleon will realize he has no need for it. And so what happens then is that Jefferson sends an emissary, a representative, to negotiate with France for the sale of New Orleans. The idea being, if the United States buys New Orleans and has rights of passage on the Mississippi, then they'll be able to resume their whiskey trade. Okay, you guys are with me. But once this guy gets there, his name is Livingston. Once Livingston gets there, Napoleon has already realized he doesn't need Louisiana for anything. So he agrees to sell Louisiana to the United States for $15 million. Now, this is incredibly important because this is an empire. I mean, look at the size of this territory. It's bigger than any of the european countries, right? And the United States now has an opportunity to buy an empire. Okay? So now this is an opportunity that people can't. Nobody can turn this down, right? $50 million is almost nothing. I mean, even in those days, it was almost nothing. Right, in terms of the amount of territory that you would acquire. And no country in the world had ever been able to buy an empire, right? But here, the United States has this opportunity. But Jefferson has an ideological problem. Does anybody want to tell me what this problem is and think about the difference between the federalists and the democratic Republicans in terms of their interpretation of the constitution, because Jefferson is. What, what is he? Democratic, republican or federalist? Democratic. Republican. Right. He's a democratic Republican. And what do the democratic Republicans say about the constitution? How should it be interpreted? Strictly or loosely? Strictly. Okay. So now, now having said that, do you see the problem that Jefferson has with buying Louisiana? With the federal government buying Louisiana, you would have to assign more power to the federal government in order to gain this purchase. Right. Because what does the constitution say about the president's ability to buy territory? It doesn't. It doesn't say anything. You guys have read it. Did you see anywhere in there where it said, oh, yeah, the president can buy a territory? It doesn't say that. Right. And so if we. If Jefferson is a strict constructionist, which he is, then that would mean he really doesn't have the authority to buy this territory. But how can you turn this territory down? And so even though there was there, he had some, you know, ideological problems with it, he went ahead with it anyway. The United States buys the Louisiana territory. And then. And then after that, you guys have probably all heard of Lewis and Clark. There was an expedition that actually started here in Pennsylvania, went down the Ohio, up the Mississippi and the Missouri. And then they walked across the mountains and they went to the west coast and spent the winter on the west coast in what's today Washington. Okay, now, now keep in mind here that when the United States bought Louisiana, nobody really knew where the limit was. Okay? It was just out there somewhere. And so there was no reason why Americans couldn't explore this territory. As it happens, this territory was actually claimed by Britain. Okay. And when. But because, I should say this way, but because Americans spent the winter on the coast in Washington, that establishes a claim by the United States. The United States will say, well, we've been there, so it's ours. And this will almost lead to. I'm sorry. This will almost lead to a war 30 or 40 years from now. We'll see how that turns out later. But any rate, this is going to be the purchase of Louisiana. The reason why Jefferson wanted to buy Louisiana was he felt that this would be a perfect landscape for his agrarian. His agrarian vision, I guess. The agrarian republic, where there's been a lot of land here that people can take advantage of to become yeoman farmers. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? One last thing I want to mention about that is that the federalists. Now this is kind of ironic. The federalists were against the purchase of Louisiana. And you would think, well, maybe it has something to do with the constitution, but remember, the federalists were the loose constructionists, so it would have seemed like something they would go along with. The problem was that if Jefferson gets away with buying Louisiana and making all that territory available to people, who are the people going to thank? Which political party? The Democratic Republicans. Exactly. So with the democratic Republicans gain a bunch of support from giving away land or selling it very cheaply, then that will take support away from the federalists. Right. You guys get what I'm saying? And so in order to try to maintain their power, they try to stop the sale, but they aren't able to do it. Okay. And then as part of this argument between or over Louisiana, there's going to be an incident where Hamilton, I'm not sure exactly. I don't remember exactly how it goes, but there's an incident of honor between Alexander Hamilton, who is now Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr, who is now vice president. And they will decide to have a duel. And the duel ends with Hamilton being killed. And then Burr escapes into the west and tries to start an empire in Kansas. Eventually, he's captured and put on trial, but he is acquitted. All right, questions, comments about any of this?",414
69,"US1: 415 -US2: 415
","Last thing before we're done here is the war of 1812. Now, you'll remember that there was a war between the British and the French that eventually becomes the napoleonic wars. And the napoleonic wars embroiled the continent of Europe. And what happens is that the great strength of the French is their army, and the great strength of the British is their navy. And the problem is that you can't defeat an army with a navy, and you can't defeat a navy with an army. What ends up happening is that this war in Europe becomes a stalemate. That the French control the continent of Europe and that the British control the seas. So the British establish a blockade around Europe and say, nobody can trade with France or anybody on the continent of Europe, okay? And then Napoleon says, nobody on the continent of Europe can trade with anybody not on the continent of Europe. Okay, well, who's anybody? Arrogant United States. Remember, the United States is a trading country. And if you'll recall from Washington's farewell address, Washington had said, we don't really care about what's going on in Europe, but we insist on the right to trade with whoever we want. So we have both the French and the British trying to keep the Americans from trading. Right? The difference is that the french fleet was destroyed in 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar, and so the British control the seas. And what will happen is that the British will start to what they call impressive american sailors. They'll interdict american commerce on the seas, and they'll impress american sailors. And impressment doesn't mean, look how big our guns are. Aren't you impressed? Right? It means that they were forced into service. And what the British are going to say is that Americans aren't really Americans, they're really british. And because they're really british, they can be forced into service. Okay? And so what will happen is that the British will seize the american goods and they'll take the american sailors and send them to East Asia. So if you ever heard the phrase I've been shanghaied. Right, but that's. That's what. That's what it means, that Americans would be sent to Shanghai. And the reason why was because it was so far away, they would never be able to come back. Right? Okay, so. So this is going to be. This is going to present an enormous challenge to the United States, because the United States really doesn't have a military. It doesn't have a navy. It has a navy, but it's not very big. Right? It's nothing compared to the british navy. But the american economy is suffering. Okay, so now, one of the ways that the Jefferson administration is going to try to. That's what I'm looking for. One of the ways that the Jefferson administration is going to try to end this intervention is by declaring an embargo, a non importation act. The idea, essentially, that we're not going to import anything from Britain. And then later he's going to pass what's known as the Embargo act, which is basically not going to trade. But the problem, of course, with that is that american economy depends heavily on trade. Even in the south, where they grow cotton, they need trade in order to be able to sell their cotton. So this is going to be a very unpopular move, and it really doesn't affect the British at all. And eventually, then Jefferson will leave office after two terms, following the precedent set by Washington, and his secretary of state, Madison will become the next president, and he'll repeal all these acts. The problem is that these acts didn't really have any effect on the british intervention in american commerce. And so by. By 1811, Congress is going to, just like it says here on the slide, is going to authorize a military buildup. And then in 1812, the United States declares war on. On Britain. Okay, now here's what we're going to know. That you may have heard the phrase before, hawks and doves. Okay. Hawks and doves was big in terms in the dialogue of the 1960s when they were talking about the war in Vietnam, because the Hawks were the ones who were in favor of the war. The doves were the ones who were against the war. And here we see that this is where that term really comes from. The people who are in favor of the war called war hawks, and they're going to be mostly southerners and westerners. Right? Why? Because they see the war with Britain as an opportunity to gain territory. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay. The federalists and people in the northeast are going to be against the war. Why? Well, mostly because they're trade. They depend on their trade with Britain. Okay, so. So we see then that. That even though the United States has declared war, part of the United States is really against the war. Okay, you guys follow me here. All right, so now here's what's going to happen when the war starts. It's going to go badly for the United States, obviously, from the, from the very beginning. Right. But then there's going to be some. Some activity in the west where the British are going to be stressed. They're actually going to be. You're going to be losing the war. Let's put it that way, right. And the result of that then, is that the people in New England, the states in New England, are going to be concerned that the British are losing the war because they're still trading with the British over the canadian border. You follow me here. All right, so they were not only traders, but they also may have been traitors, right? Because they wanted to continue that trade, and they were afraid that if the Americans were able to take Canada, that would end their trade with Britain. You follow me here? And so what happens is that the governments of these New England states decide to pull their troops out of the war. Now, the reason why this may seem odd is because during this period, the US military wasn't like it is now. It wasn't like a centralized military made up of people from all over the place. It was a military that was. That was hobbled together by troops sent from the different states. So at the beginning of the war, the federal government says, okay, Connecticut, you got to send this many troops. Massachusetts, you got to send this many troops. And then they would put them together. It's the same way it was in the civil war, too, right? The idea that each of the states had their own army under their own command. And that was why, during the war of 1812, the New England states could pull their troops out of the war. And they went so far as to negotiate a separate peace. Right? And they came together at a place called Hartford, Connecticut. There was a convention at Hartford, and they said that if the United States didn't make war. Excuse me, make peace with Britain, that they were going to secede from the Union. Wait a minute. When we think about secession, what states do we think about? Do we think about Massachusetts seceding from the Union? What states do we think about? The south. The South. Exactly. But here, the very first threat of secession comes from the northeast. And what does this tell us? It tells us that that question of whether or not the states can leave the union is still open. It's an open question. What's the answer to the question? Well, the crisis here is going to pass. So New England doesn't try to secede from the union at this point, but we see this as one of the options that many states still think is legal. Why do they think it's legal? What does the constitution say about secession? Nothing. Exactly. Now, remember when we talked about constitutional convention and we said that certain things were left unresolved? Why would the constitution say nothing about secession? When the constitution was written, certain things were left unstated. And why were they left unstated? What would have happened if they had said, okay, no states can secede from the union. And if you're from a state that is very jealous of your. Your state authority, would you be likely to go along with that? No. No. No. Okay, but now, if you're from a state that thinks that the union is actually creating a bigger country and the constitution said, well, anybody can leave the union if they want, would they go along with that? No. Okay, so if they decided one way or the other, what would have happened to their ability to agree on the constitution? There wouldn't have been an agreement. There wouldn't have been an agreement. Okay, so certain things, particularly these two things, were left unstated. The supremacy of the federal government and whether or not the states can leave the union. Okay, they were left unstated because if they had tried to define it, then they would not have been able to agree. Okay, but the problem, I mean, that means that the constitution is put into effect. But the problem is that those questions remain. And we're seeing it here now in 1813, where New England political leaders are saying, well, we can secede from the union. Right? Well, what says they can't? Nothing says they can't. You guys get what I'm saying? All right, so at any rate, the point here then, is that this is a question that's going to continue to haunt the United States until the civil war. The civil war will effectively end it, although the argument is still being made. In fact, I read this morning that several attorneys general of republican states are suing the Biden administration in court over the COVID relief plan, saying that the COVID relief plan violates the rights of the state. Okay, so we'll see how that plays out. But anyway, the point is, it's something they still argue about even today. Right? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, well, here's what happens. Almost done here, guys. Here's what happens is that in 1814 is a bad year for the United States. Britain is going to invade Virginia and Maryland. And in fact, they'll land troops and they'll burn the White House. Right? So when President Trump accused Justin Trudeau of burning the White House, he was only off by a little bit because it wasn't the Canadians, it was the British. But at any rate, the White House will be burned, and then there'll be a large fleet that will be sent to take Baltimore. But there's a fort outside of Baltimore called Fort McHenry. And that fort had to be taken in order to be able to land troops in Baltimore. Baltimore. And then what happens is that the British are going to bombard that fort throughout one night. And it so happens that the people of Baltimore have made a huge flag, a huge american flag, that they're flying over the fort at Fort McHenry. And the bombardment lasts all night. And from the deck of one of the british ships, there's going to be an american doctor named Francis Scott Key who is actually watching all night long. And in the morning, the flag is still flying, and the British are going to withdraw. Okay? And so Francis Scott Key writes a poem about the battle. Does anybody want to try and guess what that poem's name is? Star Spangled Banner. The Star Spangled Banner. Right? Oh, say, does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave? Right? All right, so when you go to the baseball game or the hockey game or whatever, you go to. And they start singing the national anthem at the beginning, they're singing about this battle, all right? Because later what will happen is that they'll take the verses of Francis Scott Key's poem and put it to the tune of a scottish drinking ballad, and it'll become the american, uh, national anthem. At any rate. Uh, so. So at any rate, the Americans. The. The British withdraw, but there's going to. There's going to be another battle that happens down here in New Orleans. But now let me just mention what's important about 1814. 1814 is the year that Napoleon was finally defeated, okay? Which means that now there's no longer a war between Britain and France. And the only reason why the United States was in the war with Britain was over the war between Britain and France. And whether or not the United States could trade. You guys follow me here. And the British don't want to. The British want to resume trading with the Americans because they're making money off of it, right? And so the British. At. When Napoleon is defeated, the British decide to call off the war, essentially, right? And there will be a. They'll negotiate a treaty at a place called Ghent in Holland, right? And the treaty will return the situation between the United States and Britain to the way it was before. They call it the status quo ante the way it was before, meaning that the United States doesn't win anything, but they don't lose anything. You guys follow? I'm saying that's essentially the outcome. The outcome is that the United States doesn't win anything, but it doesn't lose anything. Okay? But now what's going to happen? That treaty is actually signed on Christmas Eve. In 1814. But it's going to be a battle here in 18, actually December. Actually it ends up happening in January of 1850. Right. It's called the Battle of New Orleans. You probably have heard of it, right. There's an american militia general from Tennessee named Andrew Jackson, and he's going to lead a kind of a ragtag army of, of militiamen and pirates and slaves and people like that against a well organized british army. And the Americans will win that battle. And the battle happens in January of 1815. So keep in mind then that the Battle of New Orleans happens after the war is already officially over because the treaty was signed on Christmas Eve of 1814. You guys follow me here. So essentially the United States really is no longer at war. They just don't know it yet. All right, you guys following here, but because of the great distances involved, Americans in the east are going to learn about the Battle of New Orleans before they learn about the Treaty of Kentucky. So from the point of view of the Americans, they hear Andrew Jackson's won this great battle in New Orleans and the next thing then is that we've got a treaty and we didn't lose. So Americans are going to say, well, we won. Edward Jackson won the war for us. Right. And the Americans then will claim victory to this day. Actually, if you, most people will, if you hear people talking about the War of 1812, they'll say the Americans won. The reality is that the Americans didn't lose. That's the best they can say. They can't say they actually won. They didn't gain anything. Right. The idea, the reason why so many people supported the war was that they were going to be able to get Canada, but they didn't get Canada. They didn't get anything. Right. And so there was a real fear on the part of the president that Americans would be against the treaty because they didn't gain anything. But because of Andrew Jackson's victory, Americans believed they had won. And what's going to follow is this era of super patriotism. It's called the era of good feeling. Right. And the ear of good feelings is what we're going to talk about after we come back from spring break.",415
70,"US1: 421 -US2: 421
","So let's go in and move into what we were going to talk about today, and that is the so called era of good feelings. What was the last thing we talked about? Was it Andrew Jackson? Jackson going against the british army and winning? Okay. All right. And what was that event called? It was the war of something. 1812 or. Yeah, the war of 1812. Do you remember? Were all the states in favor of the war? Were all the regions in favor of the war? I want you to start thinking about the United States now for the next few lectures in terms of regions. Right. And the regions are the north, the south and the west. All right, so north would be New England and New York. And that area, the south would be all of the plantation states, essentially, the slavocracy, as they call it. And then the west would be like, for example, what we would think of today is Illinois. Iowa. Not Iowa, but Illinois and Ohio, Indiana. Those places in there. Right. So we were north, south and west. Tennessee would also be west. When we think about those three regions, were they all in favor of the war? Who were the Americans fighting against in the War of 1812? The British. The British, exactly. So now, was everybody in the United States, were all three regions on board with going to war against the British, or was there one region that was not in favor of that? What was that region? The north. Why the north? How about Danny? Danny, tell me why the northeast was opposed to going to war against the British. Wouldn't one of the reasons be because most of their money come from, like, international trade with the Brits? That's exactly right, Dan. So the northeast was against the war with the British. Right. And do you guys remember, um. In fact, tell me about the Hartford convention. They said that if they weren't going to pull out of the war, then that they would pull out of the Union. Exactly. They threatened to secede from the Union. So that shows the feeling of the. Of the people in the northeast, how strong their feelings were against being at war with their major trading ally. Right. Okay, so now, when did the United States win or lose the war? Well, I mean, it's kind of split down the middle because, I mean, they won in theory, but not really because the country still was divided. Okay. The way we would have to say it is you're on the right track, is that the United States didn't win the war, but they didn't lose the war either. Right. They kind of went back to the way it was before, which we call the status quo ante. Ante means before. Right. Okay, so the status quo ante, the way it was before. So in reality, the best that the Americans could say was that they didn't lose the war. But did Americans think they had won the war? Yeah. Yeah. And why was that? Anybody can answer. I'm done picking on Jacob. Anybody can answer. Did. Why did Americans believe they had won the war even though they. The best they could say was that they didn't lose the war. It had to do with the treaty. The people heard about the treaty. It was the treaty of ghent. Right. But they heard about something else before the treaty. Something happened, actually, even after the war was already over, theoretically. Right. But they heard about that first in the east, before they heard about the treaty. It's kind of what we were just, we started off talking about. Was it about General Andrew Jackson? Uh huh. Andrew Jackson. And what did he do? He, like, achieved a, like, victory in what battle? You're absolutely right. In the battle of New Orleans. Exactly. The battle of New Orleans. Jackson wins this really enormous victory over the british army after the war is already over because remember that the treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, but the battle didn't happen until January 12, or I think something like that of 1815. At any rate, he wins the battle against a much superior british force. And people in the east hear about Jackson winning this war against the. Against the British, and the next thing they hear is that there's a treaty, a peace treaty, right. And so Americans are convinced that they've won the war. Right. And there's this wave of patriotism that kind of erupts in the nation, if you guys will. Remember, when we read about the book about the constitution and when people started to really pay attention to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution was after the war of 1812, during this war, this wave of patriotism. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so now that being said, if the United States sees itself as the big winner and the northeast, the people in the northeast are seen, have been against the war, how does that make the rest of the country feel about the people in the northeast? What are the people in the northeast? They threatened to secede from the war, from the Union. They actually pulled their troops out of the war and threatened to secede, and we won anyway. So how do people feel about people from the northeast? Like traitors. Treason. Exactly. There are a bunch of traitors. They're chumps. Right. And now let's think about what political party was dominant in the northeast. The Federalists. Exactly. The Federalists. So what ends up happening then is that the victory in the war of 1812 brings about the end of the federalist party, right? Because the Federalists are seen. Federalists were actually governing in New England at the time of the war, and the Federalists were seen as chumps and traitors. And so the federalist party disappears, essentially. Right? It doesn't disappear, but, I mean, it ends. And so you guys will remember we talked about the first party system. The first party system was the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans. But the federalist party is going to fade away after the war of 1812. So we go into a period of about 20 years where there aren't parties, right? Essentially, everybody's in the same party, the Democratic Party or the Democratic Republicans, right? And because of that, there isn't a lot of political wrangling in terms of political partisanship. Right. And that's one of the reasons why they call this the era of good feelings, is that there's not a lot of political sniping. But it doesn't mean that there aren't any divisions, okay? Because the divisions that are evident at this point in time are not between political parties, but between regions. Okay? And remember that I told you that there were three regions just a few minutes ago. What are the three regions? Somebody tell me. The north, the south and the west. North, south and west. All right? So this is what I just talked about here. The first thing here.",421
71,"US1: 422 -US2: 422
","What was the focus of american politics during this period of the era of good feelings? And it's called, in your book, I think they call it the national consensus. And otherwise it's also called the american system. And it consists of three different policies. One, that there should be a national bank. Two, that there should be protective tariffs, and three, that there should be infrastructure. Okay. That they should spend money on infrastructure. So we're going to talk about what, what each of the three of these things is, and then we're going to look at how they affected the different regions. Okay? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so the first one, then the national bank. What would be the purpose of having a national bank? We talked about this earlier. We talked about that Hamilton wanted the national bank and Jefferson was against it, but they ended up with a national bank. But why would the national bank be important in the american system? What does it do? International credit. Right. It actually stabilizes the currency. All right? And so it makes american, it makes american credit good. And it makes american money worth something. Right? The national bank actually enhances America's worth on the world market. Okay. Does that make sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? Protective tariffs are, you know that, you know what a tariff is, right? Somebody tell me, tariff. What's a tariff? It's like a tax you pay on imports. Exactly. It's exactly right. Tax on imports. Right. And so you get a start to Joe attacks on imports. And what's the purpose of attacks on imports? To try to make it so that you try to buy or manufacture in the states rather than importing it, maybe. Okay, that's, that's actually right when we talk about protective tariffs. Now, let me just say this. At this time, the governments of almost all the countries made their money by tariffs. So the United States actually didn't tax the people, but instead what they did was they taxed imports, and that's how the federal government got its money. Okay? And that was true of a number of other countries at the same time. But protective tariffs are different because the purpose of a protective tariff is to protect american industry. And the reason why that's important is we look at before the revolution, the British had basically forbidden the colonies to manufacture, okay? And the reason why was because the purpose of the colony was to produce raw materials to the manufacturing plants in England who could then turn them into finished goods that could be sold back to the colonies. And that meant then when the United States becomes independent, it's actually behind in terms of industry compared to the British. And what that meant was that the British could actually produce and sell goods in America for less than american manufacturers could make them. Right? You guys are all following me here. So let me just give you a kind of a thought experiment here, which is not, it's not real. I'm just making up some numbers to demonstrate, right? But let's say that you have british shoes and you have american shoes. Okay? The British can make a good quality pair of shoes and sell it in the United States at a profit for $3. Right? But the american manufacturers of shoes, it actually, their shoes that they make are not quite as good quality. And in order for them to make a profit, they have to sell it at $5. Right. So you are the consumer and you go to the shoe store and you want to buy shoes and you see the good quality british shoes for $3 and the not quite so good quality american shoes for $5. Which one are you going to buy? You're going to buy the british shoes. Right. Okay. So what happens then is that the United States imposes a tax on the import of british shoes, and that tax is a four dollar tax. Right. Or a $3 tax. Okay. So what that means then is that now you go to the shoe store to buy shoes and you see the good quality british shoes for $6, but the almost as good quality american shoes for $5. Which one are you going to buy? At this point, it makes sense to be patriotic. Right. Okay. And so the purpose of these tariffs then is to support american industry. And this is going to actually be one of the most successful policies that the United States enacts because by the beginning of the 20th century, the United States is the most powerful industrial country in the world. Okay. All right. So we'll leave it at that. Questions, comments about this? Okay. Does everybody know what infrastructure is? Or anybody? I mean, you're talking about infrastructure now, infrastructure bills. You're talking about trying to get through Congress. What is infrastructure? Like farms and buildings and stuff like that. Actually, we're. It's not really that. The stuff that connects those. Right. So it's roads and canals and airports. They didn't do airports at the time. Right. But roads and canals and things like that. Now why would that be important? Well, the reason why is because America is divided by mountains. And in order to get goods from. We already talked about this. In order to get goods from the west to the east, you have to bring it around the entire continent. You have to bring it down to New Orleans and ship it to the east. Right. And so if you could build roads and canals from the west to the east. That would make it easier for people in the west to get their products to the east. Do you guys follow, I'm saying here? So now those are the three, the three policies. What I'm going to do next is I'm going to, I know you guys probably don't like this and I'm not crazy about it either, but I'm going to try to make a little whiteboard here so that I can, we can kind of consider these policies. Okay. In terms of region. I'm going to make a table. Right. And let me see if I can figure out how to do this. The table is going to be, we're going to have north, south and west. So now we're going to make three rows. National bank, protective tariffs, infrastructure. So now having said all that we said, right, we want to think about, okay, the purpose of the national bank is to do what? Create one, like one pole bank for, or, I'm sorry. Yeah, but what is the reason for it? Why do we want that stabilized currency? Okay, so, so who, who does that actually help if you're in the north, is it, is it a good idea to have a national bank because they want to trade? Yeah, it's a good idea. So it's good. How can I, how can I make it good? What's a good symbol? How about let's put a plus sign, right? Right. A plus sign. It's good. Okay. And, but in the south, is it going to be good for you to have a national bank? Keep in mind, the economy of the south is export agriculture. Their economy is not a trading economy, it's export agriculture. So is it going to be good to have a national bank for the south, for the people of the south? Is it going to be good or bad or neither? It's probably going to be neither. Right. It's not going to affect them at all very much. All right. So we just put a kind of a minus there. It's not a minus, but that's, that's just a kind of a, it's, it's a, it's a neutral sign. Okay. And then what about the west? Is the national bank going to help or hurt the west? Out of the three, a negative for the west. Okay, you're actually right. Why is that? The reason why is because let's think about the economies of the north, south and west. Right. The north is a trading, commercial economy, industrializing economy. The south is plantation agriculture, basically a kind of almost feudal economy. And the west, the major I mean, most of the economy in the west is based on farming, but in order to farm, you need what? Land. Right. And so what happens is that the west, the biggest, the biggest commercial interest in the west or the biggest economic interest in the west is land speculation, buying and selling real estate essentially. Right. Okay. So now if, if the national bank stabilizes the credit markets by making it more difficult to get credit, okay, you guys should really be paying attention to this. Okay, so if it makes it more difficult to get credit, what effect does that have on the real estate market? It makes it harder to get credit. Right. So it makes it harder to buy things. And because of that, because the major economic activity in the west is based on real estate speculation, how is that going to affect the west? Is it going to be good or bad? It's going to be bad, right. Okay. So here we have the national bank. It helps the north. It really doesn't affect the south that much and it hurts the west. All right, you guys got that? Now let's take a look at protective tariffs. What is the purpose of protective tariffs? Tax on imports. And what is the purpose of it? Protect american industry. Protect american industry. Right. So is that going to help or hurt the north? It'll help out the north because they're a trading economy, right. So it'll help the north. What about the south? They're, like you said, they're mostly an export economy and there's tariffs on exports as well. So it might hurt them a little bit. Right. It doesn't hurt them a little bit. It hurts them a lot. Okay. At least from their point of view. So we're going to put two negatives there, right, because, oh, I'm sorry, that's not how we do it. We do it like this. Xx sorry about that. Okay. The reason why is because just like you said, if the Americans raise tariffs on british imports, then the British are going to raise tariffs on american exports. And the export, the major export of the United States is cotton. Their major buyer is England. And so if what that means then is that they raise, they raise tariffs on american exports, that means that the southerners aren't getting as much money, right. You guys are following me here. But then the other half of that is that the south doesn't manufacture. So that means they have to import things that are manufactured and so they end up having to pay tariffs on the things that they're importing. So on the one hand they're not making as much money from their exports and on the other hand, they're paying more money for their imports. You guys follow what I'm saying? And this is why the south is going to be dead set against tariffs. It's going to be one of the major issues that leads to the civil war. Okay, you guys are with me. So. And then what about the west? How does the, how do tariffs affect the west? Kind of just a neutral. Yeah, it's a neutral. You're right. I think that's, that's right. Okay. So then let's take a look at, uh, infrastructure. What is the purpose of infrastructure again? Create roads and pathways to help trade and get stuff through the states. Right. To get things from the west to the east. Right. So where do they go in the east? Is it going to help or hurt the north? It'll help the north with their trade economy. They want to get as much goods out as possible. Exactly. It's going to, it's going to help the north is how's it going to affect the south? It's not really, because the south isn't manufacturing anything and they're not exporting anything to the north. Right. So we're just kind of a negative. They're kind of a neutral there. And then it will help the west. Right. Because the west can get their goods to the east easier. You guys follow I'm saying here? So now when we take a look at this chart that I just made, right, the national bank helps the north, doesn't really affect the south and it hurts the west. Protective tariffs help the north. They really hurt the south, at least from their point of view. And it really doesn't affect the west. Infrastructure helps the north, doesn't really affect the south and it helps the west. So, so what, what do we gain from looking at this chart, at this table? What kind of understanding can we help the others? Everything helps the north. The south was really unhappy. Right. The south is very unhappy. Right. Because the south, now here's the reason why, just so you know, and you really need to keep this in mind, and that is that the population of the north is growing rapidly, but the population of the south is essentially stagnant. It's not really growing. Right. Population of the west is also growing. Right. But the reason why the south is getting left out is because there's more people in the north than there are in the south. What effect would that have on the national government? They have more power in Congress. More. Which part of Congress? In the House of Representatives. Exactly. And that's where most of the laws are introduced. Okay. And so the south is, will come to believe that maybe it's not even in their interest to be in the United States. And this is where we start to see a sentiment grow in the south towards what we'll call secession. Okay, division, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about that?",422

","The way that a state is created. Let me just say it this way first, okay? It has to do with the Northwest ordinance. The Northwest ordinance was enacted before the constitution actually was written by Thomas Jefferson. Right. And the idea what the Northwest ordinance did was it established a method for adding new states. Okay? And so the way that a state would be added would be that Congress would create a territory like the Ohio territory or the Indiana territory, and then they would appoint a governor to the territory. And then after that, the. The population would grow in that territory until it reached a certain level, at which point they would come together and write a constitution and apply for admission to the union. And then the Congress would say, yes, you're a part of the union, or, no, you're not part of the union. Right? You guys are following me here. Any questions about how that happens? Okay? Now, the one thing is that at this time, when you apply for admission to the union, you have to apply to be either a free state or a slave state, because there were slave states, states where slavery was. Was practiced, and that was all in the south. Okay. Or what? Basically the orange. The orange territory here, right? Okay. Or you'd be a free state. Okay. The slave states are the free states. All right? And you would have to. If you were going to. If you were going to apply for admission to the union, you would have to say, do I want to be admitted as a slave state or a free state? Okay? But now here's the situation, is that, as I mentioned to you, the free states have control of Congress, or at least part of Congress, because of the population. But do they have control of all of Congress? How can the south maintain their. Their significance in the congress? In the Senate. In the Senate, because the Senate grants equal representation to the states, right? So every state has two senators. So we could say, well, maybe New York has 30 representatives, but they only have two senators. You see what I'm saying? And maybe South Carolina has only got ten representatives, but they say they have the same number of senators. Two senators. Right? So the equality of the number of senators from free states and slave states is called parity. P a r I t y. Parity. Okay? And what the south wanted to do was to either increase the number of representative. Number of senators that they had over the number of free state senators, or at least maintain an equality, right? At least maintain parity. Because as long as they maintain parity, they had some influence over the. Over the federal government. You guys follow what I'm saying here? Questions, comments about this? All right? So when Missouri was when the Missouri applied for admission to the union, they applied for admission as a slave state. Okay? And that's. That's going to cause kind of a political crisis in Congress, because the voices of the antislave voices are really becoming louder and louder now. Abolitionism is becoming more and more important. And what ends up happening is that Congress denies Missouri's admission as a slave state. And this creates a crisis between the states because the southern states are going to say, well, if we're not going to. We can't even maintain parity in. In the Senate. We're not even going to be part of this. We're just going to leave the union. And so they come up with a compromise, the Missouri compromise. And the compromise is that Missouri will be admitted as a slave state and Maine will be admitted as a free state. Okay? Because Maine was. Before this, it was part of Massachusetts. So Maine becomes its own state and it's free state. And so what that does is it maintains parity. They have equal number of senators in the. In the south, in the slave states and free states. You guys are with me on this. Questions, comments? And then the final thing was that they drew a line, and the line was where the Missouri meets the Mississippi right here and going all the way west as far as it goes. Right all the way to the Pacific. And that line, the purpose of that line, the Missouri compromise line, is to state that no slave states can be admitted north of that line. Now, if that's true, and they did agree to that, how much territory is there for the. For the slave states to add to the union? If they want to grow their influence in the government, where can they do it? There's nowhere left for them to go, really. Exactly. Because this. This territory all belongs to, actually starts belonging to Spain and then belongs to Mexico. And all of the. All of the. Everything south of this belongs to the Spain. In fact, there's going to be a group of people from the south who are going to attempt to annex different places in Spanish America, among them Cuba, Brazil, and Nicaragua, for the purposes of creating new states. All right. They're not going to be successful. But at any rate, the point is that the compromise is a kind of a bitter concession on the part of the south, but they do remain in the union. So the Missouri compromise passes and the union survives. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. We're going to come back to this later. So I hope you guys remember what I just said. I just want to spend a couple minutes summarizing the Missouri compromise. The Missouri compromise occurred in 1820 after Missouri applied for admission to the union. Missouri was denied admission to the union as a slave state, at which point there was a crisis in which the southern states threatened to secede, and so there was a compromise that was made to save the union. The compromise was that Missouri was admitted as a slave state. Maine was admitted as a free state so that they could maintain parity, and then there was an agreement that parity would be maintained in adding new states afterwards. And then there was a limit on the extension of slave territory above the Missouri compromise line, which was a line that was essentially where the Ohio river meets the Mississippi river and going all the way west. So you can see on this little map that I'm showing you here, the Green Line is the Missouri compromise line, which turns out to be a bitter concession on the part of the southerners, because, in reality, there was no territory left south of that line that the south could organize into territories for expansion of slave influence on the national government.",423

","One last thing we're going to talk about, and it has to do with Spanish America. And this is going to be important for us in a couple of different ways. One, by essentially cementing american foreign policy for the 19th century, but the other part of it is also going to set us up for the acquisition of all the western territories, right? So let me just start off by saying, let me see. Here's a map of Spanish America, right? And this is the map here. You see, this map shows the green part here, which was the spanish empire in America. And it's got dates in each of the different countries. And I know it's hard for you to see these dates, but, like Mexico's, 1821, Central America, 1822. Venezuela, 1814. You guys are all following me here, right? So these are the dates that these countries become independent from the spanish empire. All right? Now, the reason why. Well, let's just say the reason why they became independent was because Spain was conquered by Napoleon during the. During the napoleonic wars in Europe, same as the war of 1812 in the United States, right? But what happens is that there are basically two different groups in Spanish America who think about what's going. What kind of countries are these new countries going to be? Right. And the two groups we're just going to right now call them liberals and conservatives, okay? And the liberals are people who believe that these spanish american countries should be ruled like the United States. So they look at the United States as a model for establishing popular government. Okay? The other group is going to be the conservatives. The conservatives are the ones who actually benefited from the spanish empire. And the result of it will be that they will. So what I'm looking for, that they. They will try to keep the structure of the spanish empire in place. Okay, I want you guys to just keep that in mind, okay, as we go through this course, right? But the main thing, the difference would be the difference, essentially, between a republic like the United states, or a monarchy, like Spain. All right, you guys follow me here. And the liberals would want a republic, and the conservatives would want a monarchy. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, well, now, all of the different countries or former colonies in Spanish America had achieved independence by 1824, right? And what that means from the point of view of the Americans is that, well, let me just say it this way before I get there. And that is to say that there was a lot of political turmoil and unrest in Spanish America, and it was this contest between the liberals and the conservatives. And the Americans obviously preferred the liberals for a couple of reasons. One being because it validated the american revolution. It validated the principles of the american revolution. But the other reason had to do with trade, because liberals believed in free trade. And so what happened then? If a liberal country, if a liberal government ruled in a spanish american country that was a trading partner for the United States, you guys get what I'm saying? So american interest in Spanish America is going to be twofold. On the one hand, it's ideological, because Americans believe in the kind of spread of the american revolution toward liberalism. Liberalism. Remember, we called it democracy, secularism, capitalism. So on the one hand, it's idealistic, and on the other hand, it's economic, because if these countries are liberal countries, then they're also free traders. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? So american foreign policy, then, is going to be driven by, just like american domestic policy is going to be driven by two different motivators, idealism and economics. All right, questions? Comments? About any of that? Okay, now what happens? Just, I want to, in fact, let me skip this. I'll do that later. Okay. So what happens is that as the spanish empire recedes, as these different colonies break away from the spanish empire, they fall into political instability and turmoil. And what that does is it makes them weak and it makes them kind of targets of other colonizing countries like Britain and France. Right? The idea then, is that the weakness of these spanish american countries, the political instability in these spanish american countries, makes them targets essentially of colonialism. And the Americans are concerned about the establishment of new colonies in the Americas because they see this, again, as, first of all, the opportunity to expand America's liberal influence, but also to expand America's economic influence. And so if the colonizing powers of Europe introduced new colonies, like, for example, the French tried to, to recolonize Mexico, right? And the British tried to recolonize other places. Right? If that happens, then that is going to be detrimental to american policy. You guys follow what I'm saying here? And so the Americans then are going to come up with a doctrine. We're going to call it the Monroe doctrine, right? And the, what the Monroe doctrine essentially says is this, the United States will view the establishment of any new colonies in the Americas as, quote, the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. And then, so basically what they're saying is, what do you think they're saying? What is the United States telling Europe? We don't want your interference. Right. Or what? Or else. Or nothing, really. Because the American, we have to remember that the United States was incredibly weak at this time. Right? And so when they, when they make this statement, they're, they're basically, it's like a three year old in the sandbox shaking their fist at the adults and saying, this is my sandbox. Stay out. Right. And what are the American. What are the adults going to do in response to that? What do you guys think? I'm sorry? Spank them. Well, do you think they're going to take them seriously? No. No. Do you think that the Europeans take this very seriously? No. No, they don't. Okay. But. And that's because the United States was weak at the time. But the United States is going to become more powerful. Right. At the end of the civil war, the United States had the largest land army on earth. And at the end of the civil war, or actually during the civil war, France tried to reestablish a colony over Mexico through what they call an empire, the empire of Maximilian. Right. And at the end of the civil war, the. The american army was placed on the Rio Grande, and an american ambassador went to France and asked, when are you leaving? When are you leaving Mexico? And they left Mexico right after that. Right? So the Americans, when they have the power to enforce their doctrine, will enforce it. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this? All right. Okay. So that's the Monroe doctrine. You're not going to hear more about that in this course, but you will hear about it in us history, too. Okay. All right. So then let me just go a little bit further and talk about in 1823, the United States was weak, and it didn't, it didn't really have the power to enforce its doctrine. But by 1894. I know it's a little bit out of our era, but there was an example of how american foreign policy became more aggressive over time, and that was what's known as the Venezuela boundary dispute. Okay? And what happens here is that there was. Venezuela was an independent country, had been for a long time, but Guyana was actually a british colony, okay? British Guiana, okay? And the. The border between Venezuela and British Guiana was pretty much undefined. And the reason why was because there was really nothing of any value in this area, so they thought. But what ended up happening was that somebody discovered gold. And then all of a sudden, Venezuela said, oh, that's our. That's our territory. And the British said, no, no, it's our territory. And the British threatened to go to war against Venezuela over this territory. Right. You guys are with me. So what Venezuela does is it appeals to the United States government to enforce the Monroe doctrine against the British. And what will happen is that the secretary of state, Richard Olney, is going to incorporate what's known as the Olney corollary to the Monroe doctrine. And what that says is the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition. Okay, so what do you think it means to be practically sovereign, like their own leadership, like no one else can lead in that area. Exactly. In practice, we are sovereign, even though we don't directly rule Venezuela, but we're practically sovereign. Right. Meaning we're in practice, we're sovereign over this entire area. And it says it's fiat is law. What is a fiat little italian car. Right, but that's not what they're talking about here. Have you guys ever heard the motto, the University of California? Fiat lux. Fiat lux. Which means let there be light. Right? It's from the bible, right? God said, let there be light. Fiat lux. But what that means then, is that a fiat is what I say it, and it happens. It's a godlike power, right? So what we see here is United States claiming godlike power over the Americas, right? In 1894. And how do you think the British respond? The British back down. Now, the British didn't back down because they were afraid of the Americans. They backed down because they had interests elsewhere, and he didn't want to get into a war with the United States in the Americas. So they essentially tacitly acknowledged American are us influence over the Americas. So the Americas become the United States sphere of influence. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? And that's going to remain really, even to some extent, up to today. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right, last thing, then I want to just briefly talk about this. This is going all the way back to even before the. The mexican revolution, right. Or between. Before Mexico became independent. And that was when the United States acquired Louisiana. The eastern boundary was well documented, but the western boundary was kind of wide open. Right. Because they just knew it's out there somewhere. Okay. And then as Americans moved further and further into the western, the Spanish became more and more concerned that Americans might take this territory from them. And so what they did was they negotiated a treaty with the United States to establish the boundary between the United States and the spanish empire. All right? Or the boundary between the United States and Mexico, because Mexico will later acknowledge this treaty, right? And so what happens is that the treaty is called the treaty of Adams Onis, because Adams was the american secretary of state and Onis was the spanish foreign minister. Right? And they established the American. The line between the United States and. And Mexico, where we see this big red line here, right? So it's actually the Sabine river, the Red river, and then some other geographical locations. And the end of it then is that it really gives us a defined boundary between the United States and the spanish empire. You guys roll with me. Questions, comments about this. The other part that comes into the Treaty of Adams Onis is that Florida had been ruled by the spanish empire, but they were incapable of controlling the native population there. And so the United States had been sending troops into Florida to defeat the natives. And so one of the outcomes of this treaty was that Florida was granted to the United States. United States got Florida and they defined this boundary. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Now the last thing that I want to mention about this is that when the United States went into the negotiations over the Adams Onis treaty, they claimed that the border of the United States with, or actually the border of the Louisiana purchase was on the Rio Bravo, or we call it the Rio Grande. Right? So the Americans claimed that this territory, everything north of this territory was american, right? But when they did that, actually nobody believed that that was where the Louisiana purchase. Where the boundary of the Louisiana purchase was. Okay? It was an opening bid. It's kind of like if you want to sell your motorcycle, you'll advertise it for 10,000 and take 7000, right? And that's what the Americans did. They had advertised for 10,000, but they settled for 7000. You guys follow I'm saying here? And so this territory ends up being essentially ceded by the United States, even though the United States really never believed that they owned it. You follow what I'm saying here? Okay. So then the one thing that we want to keep in mind is that in this treaty negotiation, the United States had at one point claimed the border of Texas to be the real. Bravo. Okay. And we want to keep that in mind for another lecture that we're going to have coming up relatively soon. Okay? Questions, comments about this?",424

","Okay, well, we're going to move out of the earlier part of the nation's history, what they call the early republic. And we're moving now into kind of an expansionist era between essentially between the end of the end of the war of 1812 and the civil war. And we're going to start off by talking about, how about a major change in american democracy, because as you guys will recall, when the country was first founded, most people were left out. The people who actually could vote were only property owning males. And we talked about why that was, because the idea, in theory, was that only property owning males first had anything to protect, and secondly, they were the only ones who would be able to rule wisely in favor of the country. What we're going to see is that as the nation grows geographically, it's also going to become more democratic. And let me just show you how that happens. All right, so are any questions before I get started? You guys are with me. Okay, so now, in 1787, which you guys will know is before the constitution. Are you guys seeing the screen? Yeah. You want to share? Screen on here. Sorry about that, guys. Now can you see it? Yes. Okay. All right. So in 1787, which was before the constitution, the Congress passed a law called the Northwest ordinance that was actually written by Thomas Jefferson. And what the Northwest ordinance did was it established a means for adding new territory to the United States. All right? And they called it the Northwest Territory because this was the northwestern part of the United States at that time. And what the ordinance said was that in order to add new states and keep in mind that states are not provinces, states are actually countries. This is the way people think about them at the time. Right? So in order to add new countries to this union of countries, the United States, the way that that would happen would be that the Congress would create a territory, and then people would move into the territory. And then once people were in, once there were enough people in the territory, they would hold a convention, elect a government, and apply for admission to the union. We already talked about this, I think, Monday, about how they had to apply as either slave or free. Interestingly, about the Northwest ordinance, which was written by Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, was that slavery was prohibited in the Northwest Territory. But at any rate, the point here is that the state would apply for admission, and then the Congress would say, yes or no, you're in or you're not in, which is going to be really important for us when we start next week on the discussion that we're going to have on Monday. But at any rate, the point here is that once the Congress had said yes, then the state is in. Okay? So there's going to be a couple of reasons why people would. People who moved into the. Into the new territory would be interested in encouraging other people to come. And one would be because of the idea of land speculation, as we've said, that the major kind of industry in the west at this time is selling land. And so you have to have somebody to sell land to in order to be able to sell it. So there would be a, you know, sentiment of wanting to get more people to come into the territory. And then also it had political ramifications as well, because if you were one of the first people in these new territories, then you would be more likely to be elected, you know, governor and representative and senator and things like that. So these new territories that were created did things to try to encourage people to move their. From the east, okay? And keep in mind that most of the population of the United States is in this area now, okay? And so the result of that was that one of the ways that they did that was by lowering the qualifications to vote from being a property owner to some other. Other. Either you had. Had contributed to the community somehow by, you know, serving the militia or something like that, or even in some cases, just by being a white male, you would be extended the vote. Right. And the reason for that is because Americans liked the idea of voting. And so the idea was that they would come to. People would say, well, if I moved, I'm in Massachusetts now, and I can't vote in Massachusetts, but if I move to Ohio, I'll be able to vote, and that's a big deal to me. Right. And so Americans are actually encouraged to move into these areas, and eventually they all become states by the. By the process defined in the northwest ordinance. The significance, though, is that as people are encouraged to move further west, the states in the east are going to become more alarmed, because if they're losing population, what else are they losing in terms of government? Votes in power? Representation in the house. Exactly. They're losing representation. And so they're going to then follow suit in lowering the qualifications for voting until by the 1820s, we have in the United States something called universal manhood suffrage. Okay? Now, keep in mind that the word here is not suffering. Right? Everybody's suffering. Everybody can suffer, but not everybody can vote. So suffrage is voting, okay? And just also keep in mind that the word franchise also means the right to vote. Okay? Keep that in mind. You guys are all with me. Questions? Comments? So by the 1820s. The United States is much more democratic than it was in the beginning, and at the same time, there are literally hundreds of thousands of new voters.",431

","We talked about how the War of 1812 had led to the end of the two of the first party system because the Federalists kind of passed from the scene. The Federalists became. Were viewed as traitors, in a way, because they had been against the War of 1812. And so there's a period of time between 1814 or so and the 1820s when basically there's only one party, and it's the same as the democratic Republicans that were the first party. Okay? And as I also mentioned to you, politics at that time then becomes regional. Okay? And so what happens then, in 1824, there's an election, a presidential election, and the three major candidates are John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay from Kentucky, and Andrew Jackson from Tennessee. And the election ends up. The election ends up in the house because nobody, none of them actually gain a majority in the electoral college. Remember that in order to be elected president, you have to gain a majority in the electoral college and in the house, Adams makes a deal with Henry Clay. And that deal, essentially, is that if you give your support to me in the election, in the House, I'll make you secretary of state. Okay? It's very similar to what happened with Obama and Clinton in 2008, when Obama convinced Clinton to follow him or to give her support to him, and in return, she became secretary of state. Okay, so then what ends up happening is that. Is that the election goes to Adams. Even though Jackson had really won the popular vote, he had more votes than anybody else. So Jackson. Andrew Jackson. Keep in mind, Andrew Jackson is the hero of New Orleans, right? Is incensed, and he goes on a campaign to oust Adams from the White House in the next election, all right? He called this deal between Adams and Clay the corrupt bargain. And the idea here is that even though Jackson won the most votes, Adams became president, and it was because of this corruption, okay? And what it demonstrates to us is, in the United States called patronage. And so patronage is political favors in return for political rewards. Right? And I'm not going to really go into all this yet, just a second. But I wanted to mention that it was patronage. That it was patronage that caused the election to go to Adams. Let's think about patronage and how it works. Patronage is actually part of american politics even today, as I discussed with Jack, with Clinton and Obama. Right? And what it is is that you give somebody your political support, which represents votes, and in return, you get political favors, which is jobs. Okay? So in the case of Adams and Clay, Clay gave his support to Adams, and in return, he got secretary of state. You guys get what I'm saying Clinton gave her support to Obama and in return, she got secretary of state. You get what I'm saying here? Okay, so. So it works at that level, and it still works at that level today, right? Because all of the, all of the cabinet, like the secretary of state and secretary of treasury and all the people that Biden has just appointed in the last couple months are all serving at the pleasure of the president, right? So that means that their jobs depend on the president being in place. When the president leaves, they don't have a job anymore. Right? So, for example, secretary of state under Trump was Pompeo. When Biden became president, Pompeo is no longer secretary of state. You guys get what I'm saying? That's how it works. Okay? But what's going to happen, the thing that Jackson is going to do is he's going to mobilize all these new voters with a more expanded version of patronage. And in order for us to understand that, I want us to think about it in practical terms. Okay. And in practical terms, what we're talking about is whole neighborhoods, for example, in a city being organized to vote for a certain candidate. Okay? And this is how it happens. And this is one way that it happens anyway. That, for example, in the 1820s, there is a pretty big immigration from, say, Ireland. In the early part of the 19th century, there was a huge immigration of people from Ireland. What would happen would be that if you were an immigrant from Ireland, you more likely would be a young man, single, and you would come to a city like New York. And when you were in there, in that city, you would need a job. So you would go to the irish section of the city, and you would go to a hiring hall. And at the hiring hall, that was run by a guy who we call the boss, right? Not like, you know, bowser and Super Mario brothers, but a political boss. And you would ask the boss for a job, and the boss would give you a job, and you would work as that job on that job for the whole year until the next election. But on election day, your job was to make sure everybody got out and voted, because when everybody voted for the guy who was the police commissioner, that meant that the police commissioner could. Could allow the boss to continue to give out the police jobs. So your job as a policeman depended on the police commissioner being in office, and the police commissioner in office gave that power of jobs over to the boss. Does that make sense to you guys? Do you understand what I'm saying here? I know. I don't think I explained it very well, so, although I know what I'm talking about, I just can't get it. I can't communicate it. All right, do you guys get what I'm saying here? So if I'm an immigrant from Ireland or I'm an immigrant from anywhere, or I'm anybody, and I want a job, I go to the hiring hall. And the hiring hall. The guy who's in control of the hiring hall controls the government jobs. And the reason why he controls the government jobs is because the person who is in city official who is in charge of those jobs has given me that power in return for me delivering the votes for him. Does that make sense? You understand? I pretty much only see a bunch of blank faces. The ones I can see. Yeah, I get it. Okay. All right. So now, did any of you guys ever wonder, have you ever seen a Bugs bunny cartoon? Do you ever notice that on the Bugs bunny cartoon, the cops all have a certain accent? Whenever they have cops in a Bugs bunny cartoon, they always have certain accents. Let's watch. Okay, Clancy, take the boys and surround the house. Jiggas. Fellas, the cops. Open up. This is the police. All right, Rabbit, where's Rocky? Where's he hiding? He's not in this stove. Oh, he's hiding in the stove, eh? Would I turn on the gas if he was in there? You might, Robert. You might. Well, would I throw a lighted match in there if he was in there? Oh, no, you don't take me with you. Don't leave me with that story. I confess. I get it. I get it. Arrest me. Arrest me. So do you see that what I was talking. This is good demonstration of what I was talking about. And now you know why cops and Bugs Bunny cartoons have irish accents, right? And you thought this class was going to be a waste of time, but. So anyway, so that's the idea of patronage. And it's going to be endemic in american politics all the way through the 19th century. Okay? And you can go ahead and watch. You can go ahead and read this later on your own. The thing about it is that it creates loyalty on the part of people who are voters because their jobs are at stake. But it also creates problems. Right? And these are some of the problems that it creates. Corruption and incompetence. Right? Because people are put in positions that they're not qualified to actually perform. Okay, so at any rate, that's the issue of patronage, and it's going to become really representative of american politics. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments?",432
76,"US1: 433 -US1: 433
","Okay, so let's keep going and let's think about. Okay, we're telling this bigger story of Jackson, and he's angry at Adams because of the corrupt bargain. He has an ally named Martin Van Buren, who also will later be president himself. But what they do is they start a new process of organizing the vote. Call it grassroots organizing, but it's organizing based on patronage, just like I had, just like I demonstrated to you guys. So they would organize a whole neighborhood, say, for example, in New York. Right, or anywhere but, say New York. And the neighborhood would be organized. Everybody in that neighborhood is going to vote for Jackson. And this is a new way of doing american politics. And the opposition wasn't ready to meet the challenge. And so the result is going to be that Jackson wins the presidency in 1828. And his win, we could say, really, he is the first truly democratically elected president in the United States because he had been able to mobilize all these new votes. He wasn't just elected by the elites. You guys get what I'm saying? All right. Okay. So. And that's going to actually end up showing in american politics, because Jackson becomes actually is the first american populist president. All right, so here's another term we need to think about. What's populism? And populism essentially is when you have a strong candidate who identifies with the common people, and because the common people are so loyal to him and so supportive of him, he is able to defy conventional norms. Right? So, for example, one of the things that we'll see, you probably already saw if you watch that video, 500 nations, is that Jackson, the supreme Court ruled that moving the Cherokee from Georgia was unconstitutional, but Jackson ignored the constitution. Why could he do that? The reason why was because he was so popular, nobody could do anything about it. You see what I'm saying? So populism, let's just take a look at it here. Populism, like I said, populists identify with an appeal. The common man. Populists are anti elite, anti big business. The United States has had two populist presidents before. Donald Trump, Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt. Populist presidents rely on popular support to circumvent constitutional restrictions. As I already mentioned, Jackson and the Cherokee. And also Theodore Roosevelt basically defied Congress and took the Panama Canal from Venezuela, I think was warned it. But at any rate, the point here is there's two different kinds of populism. There's a kind of a. An authoritarian populism and a democratic populism. Right? Authoritarian populism. Is the election of a strong man. I'm going to fix it, right? And so when he's elected or that person is elected, that person is expected to fix all the problems. Right? And then the democratic populist is somebody who says, well, I'm not going to fix all the problems. We're all going to do it together. It's a kind of a communal thing. So there's really two different approaches to populism or two different manifestations of it, okay? But either way, you end up with the same situation. Right? So when we look at, for example, in 2016, where were two candidates who were running, Donald Trump for the Republicans and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats, both of them were populists. Okay? But they were, their approach was very different. You follow what I'm saying? So, so essentially, Andrew Jackson was the result. If Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders had a baby, he would be. He would be that, because he was both, he was both a strong man, but he had this kind of popular appeal. You guys are with me on this. Questions, comments?",433
77,"US1: 434 -US1: 434
","So what happens then? Jackson is elected. And one of the ways we can see, I mean, one demonstration of how things change is that when politicians in Washington, politics in Washington had been controlled by elites from the very beginning, and the common people were pretty much just left out. But when, when Jackson was elected the first, on his inauguration night, he had a big party at the White House and he invited everybody over, right? He says, everybody, come on over to the White House. We're going to have a party. So the White House is filled up with all these common people, mechanics, farmers, different kinds of people. And it was chaos. It's kind of like inviting a bunch of college students to your party at your apartment. You can imagine what the place is going to look like the next day. Right? So, and this is what happened at the White House. And the only way they could get the people out was to move all the booze out on the lawn so that the people would go out to get the booze and they wouldn't let them back in. Right. But that shows this kind of movement towards a more common or more democratic atmosphere in american government. People who are, who are not elite, feeling that they have ownership in the government. You guys follow me here. Questions, comments about this? Okay, well, this is going to be shocking to the political elite, right? This is going to be something that causes a great deal of stress among the people who are the elite. And what the result of it is going to be is that the people who, people who don't have anything else in common, are you going to unite because they don't like Andrew Jackson? They want to get rid of Andrew Jackson. So they form a new party. And this new party is going to be called the Whigs. Alright? So we had, remember we had democratic Republicans and federalists before the federalist party essentially went away. Then there was no party. And now we have a new party, a new two party system with the Democrats being represented by Andrew Jackson and the Whigs being everybody who doesn't like Andrew Jackson. Right. So now, when we, remember, I think it was on Monday, we talked about the american system and we talked about how american politics was driven by regional concerns, north, south and west. Right. In this case, what we're going to see happening is that those concerns will remain. But the motivator behind the Whigs is going to be their hatred of Andrew Jackson. Right. So it's really people who really don't have anything else in common coming together and forming a party to, to oppose the man that's in power. Okay, you guys are with me questions? Comments about this? Anybody? Okay, well, so these people call themselves Whigs. Why do they call themselves that? Well, it's not because they put wigs on their head, because that's w I g. Right. Whigs are the party in England who are anti monarchy. So why would an american political party name themselves after an english political party that is anti monarchy? What monarchy? Are they against the english monarchy? No, these people, these american politicians are not against the english monarchy. What monarch are they against? An american monarch. Yeah. Which one? Andrew Jackson. King Andrew. Exactly. King Andrew. Right. So they believe that Andrew Jackson is acting like a king, and that's. That's basically their. Their political platform. Okay, questions? Comments? The last thing I want to mention about this is, do you. Does anybody. Have you ever wondered why the Democratic Party is represented by a donkey? Because Andrew Jackson, when people were. People who were opposed to Andrew Jackson, called him the jackass. Andrew Jackass. And so the jackass became the symbol of Andrew Jackson, and he was really the founder of the Democratic Party. Right. So that's why the Democratic Party has its symbol as a donkey. Okay, questions? It's still a jackass. They just don't call it that. They call it donkey instead. All right, questions? Comments about.",434
78,"US1: 435 -US1: 435
","Okay. Well, let's talk a little bit about Andrew Jackson's presidency. Okay. And his big issue. Andrew Jackson's big political issue is that he is opposed to the bank. He's opposed to the national bank. Now keep in mind that Andrew Jackson is from Tennessee. Let's see if we can think about what we learned on Monday and discover why Andrew Jackson would be against the national bank. First off, we want to wonder, is Tennessee north south or west? South. We would think of it as south today, but it was west then, right. It was in the west. All right, so Andrew Jackson comes from the west and he's opposed to the national bank. I wonder why. Why would that be? Because it was negative for the west. Why? Why was it negative for the west? Because they needed the. The credit to buy real estate. Real estate and land and stuff. And National bank would kind of make that a bit harder for them. Right. National bank made it harder for them to get credit. Okay. Exactly. All right. So. So he's very much against the national bank, but when it comes to tariffs, because he's from the west, he doesn't care about the national tariffs. Right. And so Congress is going to start to enact new and more restrictive tariffs during the 1820s and 1830s. And does anybody remember what was the purpose of tariffs? We talked about protective tariffs to tax imports and exports. What was the reason for it? We were calling protective. Oh, to protect, like, american. The american economy and stuff. Exactly. Encourage, like, the making of goods in America. Exactly. So it supports american industry. But who does it hurt? Sorry? Who does. Who do protective tariffs hurt? I like self sustaining economies like the south who relied on exporting like cotton. Okay, so then what happens is that Jackson. This is not Jackson. Jackson doesn't really care about the tariffs. And so they go ahead and they go through. But the south is incensed. The south is dead set opposed to these tariffs. And eventually what happens with the passing of a new tariff called the southerners call the tariff of abominations. There's a sense among many people, particularly in the south, that the state government actually takes precedence over the national government. Okay. And this is an argument that's been in place since the very beginning, because the constitution can be interpreted to not say which government is actually supreme. The constitution has a supremacy clause, but the understanding of the constitution is that it limits the powers of the federal government to what the constitution provides. And so it can be supreme in every place where it has jurisdiction, but still have the state governments be supreme in everything else. You guys follow? I'm saying here. And so many of the states who are feeling the negative consequences of these new tariffs are going to start talking about, well, we shouldn't even have to follow them. We can nullify them. Right? So the idea here is that they believe that it. That they can. That if the federal government tries to impose a law that goes against the interests of the state, the state can nullify that law. Okay. And again, this goes all the way back. Thomas Jefferson actually was in favor of the idea of nullification. Okay, so at any rate, so in 1832, after they enact this new tariff, the state of South Carolina is going to enact an ordinance of nullification. The ordinance of nullification essentially says that the tariffs are nullified, they're not going to enact, they're not going to enforce the tariff, and that they threatened to secede from the union. Okay, so now the one thing I want you guys to understand now is that, is that South Carolina is as far south as you can go before the civil war. What do I mean by that? If I say South Carolina is as far south as you go, as you can go, what am I saying? Is that true? Geographically? No. But as far as the state's rights are concerned, that nothing passes. That South Carolina, essentially that South Carolina becomes the symbol of states rights and white supremacy. Right. South Carolina becomes the symbol states rights and white supremacy. Okay, so now South Carolina says we're not going to collect the tariff. Jackson, who, as I already mentioned, didn't really care about the tariff, but does care about the union, threatens to intervene in South Carolina militarily. And the result of it is that there is a compromise. A bunch of people come together, Jackson, this handsome fellow here, John Calhoun, and congressional leaders come together and they negotiate a reduction in the tariffs. And so then the South Carolina repeals the nullification act. Right. Nullification ordinance. Okay, you guys are with me. So now the outcome of it is that the South Carolina doesn't succeed and the tariffs are reduced. Okay, who wins? The south. Well, didn't the tariffs get reduced? Tariffs got reduced. Is that what they really want? What do they really want? They didn't want to pay the tariff at all. They don't want any tariffs. Right. So did they get what they wanted? Yeah. What about. What about the national government in this case, represented by Jackson? Did he get what he wanted? Yes. What did he want? For South Carolina to stay. To stay and pay a little bit of the tariff and pay all the tariff. Right. So did they get what they wanted? The push? Did. Did the north get everything they wanted? Did the congress, the national government get everything they wanted? What did they want? We just said it. They wanted South Carolina to stay in the union and wanted them to pay all of the tariffs, right. Or collect all the tariffs. And did they get that? Yes. No, they didn't. Because remember, the tariffs were reduced, right? So they didn't get everything they wanted. They got some of what they wanted, but they didn't get everything they wanted. Right? You guys get what I'm saying here? And the south, did they get everything they wanted? Remember, they wanted no tariffs at all, right? Did they get everything they wanted? No, they didn't get everything they wanted. That's what compromise means. You don't get everything, but you get something. You see what I'm saying? And it keeps the union together. But now I want you to think, I know you guys are having a hard time getting the old brain fired up this morning, but I, but I want you to think about this and I'm not going to answer it for you. And that is, what question is left unanswered in terms of the relationship between the national government and the state government? Who has more power? Exactly. Which government is supreme? So essentially the essential question here really wasn't the tariff. The essential question was which government is supreme? Is it the national government or is it the state government? And they made a compromise, but the compromise didn't settle that question, which means that that question will come up again later. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. I've made you suffer enough. Go away. Live long and prosper.",435

","Winfield Scott establishes american administration over Mexico City, and then they start to negotiate a treaty. The problem is there's no government to negotiate with. And so eventually what ends up happening is that Mexicans are able to form a government, and they do start to negotiate with the. With the Americans. All right, in the meantime, in the United States, there's a group of people, many people, actually, who say, well, we've already got Mexico. Why don't we just keep it right? And this is what's known as the all Mexico idea. The all Mexico idea is the idea that since we've already taken it, we might as well keep it right. But there were a number of people who were in favor of that, but there were also a number of people who were against it. And it really kind of brings together two very different groups who are opposed to the idea of all Mexico. One of them is the liberals, like Abraham Lincoln, who say that american conquest of territory goes against the american ideal. American ideals don't include conquest. American ideals include liberty and equality and those sorts of things. And also, there's another group led by this guy, John Calhoun. You remember, we talked about him briefly last week when we said that he was the kind of face of southern white supremacy and states rights, and he thought that adding Mexicans to the United States would weaken american democracy because democracy was only for white people. He actually said this in the Congress, essentially, right, that only white people are able to practice democracy. And therefore, if we add all these non white people to the United States, that will weaken the United States. Okay, so we have two very different points of view, but both of them against. Against the annexation of Mexico. All right, guys, with any questions, comments about this? All right, so the. Polk had sent a diplomat, his name was Nicholas Tristram, to Mexico to negotiate the treaty. He had a falling out with Trist and eventually fired Trist. But in the meantime, Trist had actually gained the trust of the mexican government. So he went ahead and negotiated a treaty. The treaty was negotiated a little town outside of Mexico called Guadalupe Hidalgo. And they. They actually came to an agreement on this date, February 2, 1848. Right? And the agreement, Mark, made the border between the United States at the Rio Bravo. And then there, this was the border that was defined. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments about this? So that's where we see the creation of most of our southern border. All right, there was one thing that comes about after this, and that is that, if you'll recall, the reason why Polk wanted to add California was why trade with Asia all right, so let's think about this for a minute. Once we get all the goods from Asia to San Francisco, or actually Sacramento, which is connected to San Francisco by river, right? Once we get all the goods from Asia to Sacramento, then what? Where is the population of the United States located? It's all back here in the east. So how are you going to get goods from California back east? What kind of a technology would allow that? Trains. Exactly. A railroad. Okay, so now there's a number of different proposals in Congress about building railroads, okay? To connect the west coast with the east. And one of them was to connect Chicago to Seattle. One of them was to connect Chicago to Sacramento. That's the Union Pacific. And one of them was to connect New Orleans to Los Angeles. Okay? And the problem with create with building a railroad from New Orleans to Los Angeles was that you couldn't build a railroad through this territory. It was occupied by hostile natives and too rugged, too mountainous. And so the United States determined that the best place to build this railroad would be through this territory. But this territory still actually belonged to Mexico. Okay? So what happened was, in 1853, Americans sent a man named Gadsden to Mexico to negotiate with Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, who's once again president for the last time, actually, the sale of this area. And Santa Ana vigorously said, no, we will not sell this territory. And Gadsden then put out the word in Mexico City, reminding them, well, do you remember what happened last time? You said that you wouldn't sell us territory. Right. Be shame if something happened, right? And so they sold the territory, and that's how we added that last little bit of the southern border. All right, so that's then the creation of the southern border and the war with Mexico. All right, questions? Comments?",441

","All right, well, here's the problem. The problem is Texas applies for admission to the union, but they're denied. Okay? The Congress doesn't allow the admission of Texas to the union. Texas applied for admission as a slave state. Now, the reason why Texas was denied admission, there's actually two reasons. One is because Mexico had a large, well trained, european style army, and the United States had none. Had no army. Essentially, a bunch of militias. Right? And Mexico had made it clear that if Texas became part of the United States, that would be a declaration of war. And the United States did not want to go to war with Mexico at that time because they thought Mexico was stronger. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? And they would have been, too, if it wasn't for the fact that they were in such political upheaval. All right, the second reason why is because slavery is now a polarizing issue in Congress, and it's very difficult to. So where to move forward? It's very difficult to admit any state to the Union, slave or free, because the slavery issue is so divisive. Do you guys follow? I'm saying? So Texas is denied admission for two reasons. One, because Americans are concerned they wouldn't be able to win a war against Mexico. And number two, because of the issue of slavery. Okay, but. But the way that the proponents of manifest destiny explain it is by saying that while Texas wasn't ready. Okay, keep in mind that the proponents of manifest destiny are saying that the only way that. That, uh. That states can be added to the temple liberty is if they're ready. And the. These people, led by the guy I just showed you here, John L. O'Sullivan. And, in fact, this is what he's writing about in this essay, right? Is that in 1836, Texas was not ready to be part of the United States because they didn't have the necessary tradition of liberty. Okay, you guys following here? Questions? Comments? Keep in mind that every other. Every other state had that had been added to the union since the revolution had been a territory first. But Texas was never a territory of the United States. It was a territory of Mexico. All right, so. Or of the spanish empire. All right, so Texas is denied admission. But what O'Sullivan argues is that by 1845, they have become ready to be added to the union. Now, why would he write this in 1845? The reason why is because in 1845, Congress annexed Texas. All right? Congress acted to add Texas as a state to the United States, okay? And so this article about manifest destiny is an argument about why taxes should be added to the United States. Because they're ready. You guys. You guys follow I'm saying here? Okay, so when. When Congress annexed Texas, they recognized that there was a difference of opinion between Mexicans and Texans over what was the border. And so Congress did not declare a border. They just said that they would negotiate the border with the. With the Mexicans when they annex Texas. All right, you guys are following here. Any questions? Comments? Okay, so now what happens is that there's a. There's an election in 1844. The man who's elected president is James K. Polk. And James K. Polk was a believer in american expansion, and particularly what James K. Polk wanted was San Francisco. Why would James K. Polk want San Francisco? Remember that the United States is, on the one hand, a trading country, but the traders in the United States are located here in the northeast, right? And the only way that they can get to Asia is to go either around Africa or around South America. So that puts them at a disadvantage to all the other european traders. But if they could control San Francisco, then they would have direct access to China. You follow what I'm saying? So they want. The Polk wants, and the Democrats. The Americans want California because they want to be able to trade with China. Okay, so what happens then is that Polk sends a representative, his name is John Slidell, from Louisiana to Mexico to negotiate the sale of California. Okay, now let me just tell you briefly about California. California was very sparsely settled, like Texas or even worse. Right? Hardly any Mexicans lived there after independence, there was a split between northern and southern California, and they were fighting amongst each other over who was the real California. And there were a number of Americans that were also moving in to California, and there was a concern on the part of the Mexicans that Americans would eventually, eventually take over. Okay. But there was already a lot. There were already a large number of people in California who were ready to become part of the United States. And so when Slidell, John Slidell, goes to Mexico City to negotiate the sale of California, what happens is that the critics of the government, the opposition to the government, is going to spread the rumor that Slidell is there to actually purchase taxes. And that is such a hot button issue in Mexico City that the government falls. The government, the government loses control, and there's a period of political instability, right? So the Slidell mission actually failed, and the Americans got nothing. Right? You guys are with me. But now. Now what happens next is that Polk decides that rather than because there's nobody to negotiate with and he can't buy the territory, they're going to take it all right. And so he makes plans for. For taking really all of the. What we call the southwest today. Right. It was the northwest for the mexican point of view. But he did was he sent an army from Texas to the do Grande, and he established a fort there called Fort Brown, which is today Brownsville, Texas. Right. And the reason why he did this was because he knew that the Mexicans believed that the Rio Grande was well within their border. Right. Because, if you will recall, Mexicans believed that the border of Texas was at the Nueces and the border of the United States was at the Sabine. Right. And that the Rio Grande was nothing. And so by putting an army on the Rio Grande, what essentially polk is doing is inviting a response, because from the point of view of the Mexicans, this looks like an invasion. Right? And, in fact, if you go to Mexico today and you ask them about this war, they don't call it the mexican american war. They call it the invasion, the north american invasion in which we lost half of our territory. Right. And you can see from their point of view that it was. It was an invasion from their point of view. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. So what happens next in. Is that Mexican. There's a mexican general who crosses the Rio Bravo and attacks the Americans at Fort Brown. Okay? Now, the Americans were able to actually win the battle, but the news of that attack reaches Washington, and Polk uses that news to demand a declaration of war from Congress. Okay? So basically what he does is he dumps a whole bunch of documents on Congress and says, I need a declaration of war, and I need it in 24 hours. And Congress didn't have the time to actually go through all the documents. And so within 24 hours, he had his declaration of war. The thing is that, like I said, they didn't. There were people who were concerned that they weren't really being told everything they needed to know, but they were also concerned that they didn't want to vote against the troops. Right. They feared kind of political repercussions for being against the war that a lot of people were in favor of. And so the United States voted to declare war. And then later, what's going to happen is that they realize that basically what Polk had said about the mexican invasion of the United States was untrue, but by that time, uh, they were already committed. So. So that meant then that there was. There was no way to actually pull the troops back, because if you pull the troops back, then that's not supporting the troops. And you know what happens when you don't support the troops. Right. Okay, so. So the United States is then basically duped into going to war with Mexico, and the United States starts to win a lot of battles right up front. So the United States really pretty much takes over northern Mexico quickly. There is an expedition that leaves Missouri, Kansas, Fort Leavenworth, that marches to California, led by Stephen Carney, Carney High School, right down the street from Mesa College. And so within weeks, the United States actually already controls everything that they want from Mexico. And so they want the war to be over now, but because there isn't a stable government in Mexico City, there's nobody to negotiate with. You follow me here. And so what happens then is that Polk decides to invade Mexico from Veracruz. All right? Vera Cruz, if you guys will recall, was the place where Cortez started his conquest of Mexico. And the mexican army, then, led by General Winfield Scott, will march across Mexico into Mexico City. And then on September 14, 1846, the United States army enters Mexico City. All right, so this painting here shows the center of Mexico City. It's called a Sokolo, and all these buildings are still there. This is the national cathedral. This was the national palace, right. What you can't see in this, in this painting is that the american flag is flying over the national palace, right? So now you have to consider what you would think if you saw, say, an iranian flag flying over the United States Congress. Angry. Angry, exactly. And this is what Mexicans felt. Mexicans were angry that the United States had taken over their capital, and they're still angry. Okay. Now Americans will say, well, that was a long time ago. You guys should just get over it. Right? Right. But we forgot about it. A lot of you guys probably didn't even know about most of this stuff, right? But the Mexicans didn't forget. All right? And I remember when I was in Mexico City doing research, I was at the National History Museum at Chapultepec, and there was a room in that museum called the room of the interventions, and it showed all the different times that, that Mexico had been intervened in by foreign governments, United States, the French, and the Spanish, right? And I remember them bringing little school kids through the room and pointing out to the, to the paintings and say, look, this is what the Americans did to us, right? So they didn't forget. And what we're going to see in american perception, America's perception in Spanish, America is going to change overnight from one of an ally in the revolution of liberty to an enemy, a predator that's to be feared. American relations with Spanish America are shaped by this event of the United States invading Mexico and taking its territory. Okay? And even though, you know, we go to Mexico and we're the good guys, you should like us, right? But they're very suspicious. And you can understand why, if you understand the mentality behind their understanding of what they call the north american invasion in which they lost half of their territory.",441

","Today we're going to talk about, instead of the expansion of the franchise, we're going to talk about expansion of the geographical extent of the United States, and we're going to see how all of the territories, almost all of the territories west of Louisiana purchase, get added to the United States in a period of time and the creation of the border with Mexico. All right, questions, comments about any of this? All right, so let's talk about first manifest destiny. You guys have heard of manifest destiny before. What is it? Isn't it that the colonists kind of believed that it was like their divine right to that land? Okay, so that's. That's exactly what you guys mostly have been taught. We're not really talking about colonists now. We're talking about the Americans. Right, but the idea that we've been taught is that manifest destiny was the american people's God given right to control the north american continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. And that is actually what it comes to mean in a certain sense. But like everything else in american history, there's really two different applications, I guess you could say, of the. Of the term manifest destiny. All right, so on the one hand, there is that kind of economic aspect that we've talked about that says that all of this territory should be added to the United States. So that can add to the economic vitality of the United States. But the original idea of manifest destiny was actually an ideological thing. All right? And the way that we can understand this ideology is to think about the term temple of liberty. Okay? So the temple of liberty was a way that Americans described the federal system. The federalist system. Right. So now I'm going to actually invite another five minutes of silence by asking you, what is federalism? It's like how powers divided between a national government, for example. Like a state government. Exactly. So that's what we've been. One of the themes that we've had ever since the beginning was that there was. That there was a disconnect between, or a disconnect in the understanding of the powers of the federal government versus the state government. And that's the issue of federalism. Right, but the idea behind federalism is that you have a national government that does all of the things that the state governments can't do, and then everything that the state governments can do, they do. All right, so the federalist system in the United States is set up in such a way that the states are considered to be individual countries, and they have all the rights and privileges of a country except for those that can't be accomplished along with the other states. So the. Well, the way that a state would get added to the federal government, we've talked about this before, having to do with the Northwest ordinance, is that the national government, the Congress, creates a territory, and people move into the territory. And then once enough people are in the territory, they convene a convention. The. They create a government and write a constitution, and then they apply for admission to the union, in this case, either as slave or free. Okay, so the idea then is that states can be added to the union, but before they can be added to the union, they have to be ready. And how states can be added to the union, how they can be ready is by being democratic, by having a democratic government, by having a liberal, what we call classically liberal government or a government under a constitution. So the United States can add new countries, but every country that's added has to be a constitutional gov. Has to have a constitutional government. You can't add a monarchy or a theocracy that can't be part of the United States, because the United States is. Is a. Is a almost, I guess you could say confederation or union of individual countries that are all democratic. All right, you guys get what I'm saying? So that aspect of the american system that every state has to be democratic is described by earlier by Americans during the period we're talking about as the temple of liberty, because every state that's added to the United States has to have or demonstrate or practice what we have called liberty. Okay. And if. I hate to do this, but we go all the way back to the very beginning of the course, and we talk about what is liberty. Remember, liberty with an exclamation point is democracy, secularism, capitalism, the government style of the United States called classical liberalism. All right, you guys are all with me on this. Questions? Comments? So what characterizes all of the states together is liberty. And. And the way that a state can be added to the union is by being. By. By practicing, by putting into practice the ideas of liberty. You guys get what I'm saying? So that means that the United States, according to the people who lived at the time, they view the United States as the temple of liberty. So now let's think for a minute about if. Let's say that. I mean, think about this is actually religious. They're thinking about this in religious terms. All right, so let's think about if there was a religion and they had a temple, and you were walking down the street one day and you look inside the temple and you see what's going on in there? You say, I think I'd like to be part of that. So how would that. How would you become a part of that temple? Well, you would go into the temple and you'd find out what they were doing and you'd figure out how to practice it. And then after some period of time, they'd ask you if you believed on all the things that they believed in, and you'd practice all the things that they practiced. And if you said yes, you'd be in. Right. But if you went in and said, I don't really believe any of this stuff, but I want to be part of it anyway, they wouldn't let you in. You get what I'm saying? And the other part of it is that they don't go out on the street and beat people over the head and drag them in. You see what I'm saying? It's voluntary. And not only is it voluntary, but you have to be ready. This is the way people thought about adding territories to the union, is that these territories can be added to the union, but they have to demonstrate liberty, right? They have to be ready. Okay. And, and so what that means, if you think about that, is that the original concept of manifest destiny is not an ideology of conquest. It's not the idea that it's just out there and you can take it. It means that that territory can be added, but only when it's ready. Okay, you guys follow I'm saying here? So now let's think about that in terms. Let me just. I don't remember what I wrote here. Yeah. So, so what we see here then is the two kind of understandings of manifest destiny around the period of time that we're talking about. The first one, this, this article in United States magazine Democratic Review, is the first time that the words manifest destiny are actually appear in print. And there, John L. O'Sullivan describes manifest destiny, America's manifest destiny, to overspread the continent. By the, by the way that I just talked about, the advance guard, irresistible army of anglo saxon immigration armed with a plow on the rifle, markings trail with schools and colleges, courts and representatives, halls, mills and meeting houses. All of this means that they are getting ready. They are becoming ready. Okay. And what's being talked about here is the annexation of Texas, which we're going to talk about in just a couple of minutes, right. Because people are saying that Texas, when Texas was originally applied for statehood, they were denied. And now John L. O'Sullivan is saying they are ready. And how can they be ready? What do they have to demonstrate to be ready to be part of the United States? Liberty. Liberty, exactly. All right. Now, on the other hand, and this happens during the mexican american war, which is another thing going to talk about in just a couple minutes, is this senator William Gilpin, who said, who described manifest destiny this way, the untransacted destiny of the american people is to subdue the continent, to rush over this vast field to the Pacific Ocean. Divine task, immortal mission. Let us trade fast and joyfully on the open trail before us, but every american heart open wide for patriotism to glow undimmed, to confide with religious faith in the sublime and prodigious destiny of his well loved country. All right, so that doesn't sound like the kind of more cautious approach that manifest destiny originally had, but it sounds more like an ideology of conquest, doesn't it? It sounds more like the United States has been granted by God the destiny of subduing the north american continent. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So there's really two different definitions here. And the reason why I bring that up is because this fits with the american system, if you guys will remember, when we're going all the way back to the Washington administration, there are two very different visions of what kind of a country the United States is. Is it a temple of liberty? Is it a temple of. Is it a place, a landscape of liberty, where people can practice their individual rights? Or is it a place where you can make lots of money? Is it an economic powerhouse? Right? And that split remains in every aspect of american politics. So we see it in the break between Jefferson and Hamilton. We see it in the foreign policy of the United States, which on the one hand, stands for liberty and justice, and on the other hand, becomes an imperial power. Right. And here we see it in our, in our concept of how we acquire the west. Okay, are you guys following me saying here there's two different aspects, the ideological and the. And the economic. And acquiring territory for the sake of acquiring territory is driven by economics. Okay, because you want what's on the land. Okay. Or you want the land.",441

","Let's see how this works in a real world example, okay? And the first thing we have to do is we have to think a little bit about mexican history. Okay? We've already discussed briefly the independence of Spanish America when we talked about the Monroe doctrine. What happens in Mexico is that there is a long civil war. It starts in 1810. And if many of you, if you know anything about Mexico, you know that Mexican Independence Day is September 16 and die cis. And it is the anniversary of el Grito, which was the cry of liberty that was announced by Hidalgo on September 16, 1810. So that's the day that they celebrate independence, but they didn't actually gain independence until 1821. Okay? So it's kind of like in the United States, we celebrate american independence on July 4, but America didn't actually gain independence until 1783. You guys follow what I'm saying? So, at any rate, the point here is that Mexico becomes an independent country in 1821. When it becomes independent, the first government that's installed is a constitutional monarchy. But that government doesn't last very long. Let me just say. Let me say it this way, that the controversy that plagued the United States in the first administration over what kind of a country is the United States. Is it an economic powerhouse, a conservative state, or is it a liberal state? Every other independent country attaining independence during this period of time experienced something similar. So in Mexico, instead of calling them federalists and democratic republicans, they call them centralists and federalists, okay? And the centralists were the more conservative ones. And the centralists believed that the Mexico, the independent Mexico should be ruled in the same way that it had been under the spanish monarchy. Because under the spanish monarchy, the people that were in control had made lots of money. Right? So centralism basically says everything has to be ruled from the center. During the monarchy, the center was the king. But now that they're a republic, the center is the government in Mexico City. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. But at the same time, the government that Mexico installed was a federal government, meaning a government like the United States that has two levels of government, a federal government and a state government. But in the mexican constitution, the state governments were much more powerful than the governments in the United States. Okay? And the result of that was that the federalists believe that most of the authority in the country should reside in the states rather than in the central government. So it's really. It's very similar to what happened in the United States. The problem is that in the United States, we saw that controversy between centralism and federalism or between federalists and democratic Republicans become the subject of american politics. And the differences between the two different ideals are worked out in the ballot box, and that's because of the election of 1800 and the peaceful transfer of power. But that doesn't happen in Mexico or anywhere else. Right. What happens instead is that when the original group is voted out of office, they refuse to leave office, and after every election, they have an uprising. Essentially it's called a pronunciamiento, right. And they fight it out. So the way that it works in Mexico is going to be that they have the election, and then whoever loses the election refuses to give up, and then they fight it out. And whoever wins the battle wins the government, essentially. Right. That makes sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? You guys are following me here. And the division between the centralists and the federalists is as bad or worse as the division between the democratic Republicans and the federalists in the United States. And essentially what it means is that they're willing to kill each other in order to gain control of the government. All right, you guys are all with me with this. Questions? Comments? So the first government that was actually enacted in, like I said, in Mexico was a federalist government. And during this time of the federalist government, there was one of the problems that Mexico had was the northern frontier, because the northern frontier, let me just show you a map here. The northern frontier consists all of these territories, okay? And these territories are very sparsely populated by Mexicans, okay? Mexican. The Mexican, the hispanic lifestyle, hispanic culture is an urban culture, and they don't want to live out in the middle of nowhere, a little house on a prairie, right? And so most of the population of Mexico was, was concentrated in the cities. And since there really weren't any cities in this vast northern territory, hardly anybody went there. And they couldn't even get people to go there. They couldn't even, they couldn't even lure people there or bribe them to go there. And the problem was that the border between the United States and Mexico was, was fluid. Nobody actually really knew where it was. And beyond that, that Americans and others, particularly Americans, I mean, the Russians and the British, also had their eyes on California. Right, and Texas. But the Americans are very aggressive about their ideas of, of taking this territory. So Mexico. So Mexico, when it becomes independent, is concerned about the integrity of their border. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this. You guys are all following me here, right? Okay, so now, in the 1830s, 1820s, there was an economic downturn in the United States, and there was a group of people who decided that they wanted to emigrate to find better opportunity. And they were led by this guy Moses. Not Moses from the Bible, but Moses Austin. Right? Moses Austin went to Mexico City to negotiate, moving into Texas, bringing a group of people into Texas. And he received permission to bring these people into Texas. The idea, the agreement, was that he could bring in 20,000 settlers, but that those settlers had to become mexican citizens, and they had to swear allegiance to Mexico, they had to learn how to speak Spanish, and they had to become Catholics, all right? And so here these people are faced with the opportunity to get free land. And keep in mind that land is still considered to be wealth, right? These people are faced with the possibility of attaining free land if they learn how to speak Spanish. And so they say, hola, I'm Mexican, right? And so they all move in, and there's actually a concentration of Americans in Texas. All right? Now we want to say, okay, well, this was supposed to solve the problem of the mexican government by actually creating 20,000 mexican citizens in Texas. And legally, technically, that was true, but in reality, the people that moved into Texas never considered themselves Mexicans. They always considered themselves american, and they always believed that at some point, Texas would become part of the United States. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so now, this guy, Stephen Austin, was the guy who led all of the people in. Here's what happens when we're looking at this centralist federalist controversy. When. When the Americans moved into Texas, one of the understandings that they had was that they would be self governing because this was under the federalist government, okay? And so their authority would be local to them, just like many people in the United States believed. And as part of that, they counted on the ability to own slaves, because the economy of Texas was a plantation economy, like everywhere else in the south, okay? And so when they moved in there, there was this understanding that Texas would be. Would be allowed to. The settlers in Texas would be allowed to use slaves, right, to own slaves, and that they would be relatively self governing, okay? But in 1826, the mexican government outlawed slavery. So there was a bit of a kerfuffle in Texas because the settlers in Texas were all upset because they thought they were going to lose their slaves. But they made a deal with the mexican government that they could keep their slaves for now, even though at some point, they're going to have to get rid of them. But, okay. So that kind of solves that problem a little bit. But there's another problem, and that is that even though there are 20,000 american settlers that were allowed to come in because they're there, a number of other Americans are crossing the border illegally to get into Texas to squat on the land. Right. So if you cross the border from one country to another country without permission, what do you call that? Illegal immigration. Illegal immigration. So Mexico had a terrible illegal immigration problem from Americans. You guys are following me here. All right? And so what they did is they decided they were going to close the border, right? They didn't. They didn't build a wall, but they were going to close the border to keep the Americans out. Right? And in the middle of all this, there's this political turmoil between centralists and federalists that's happening. And in 1836, the centralists actually overturned the government and rewrote the constitution. Okay? And that constitution then placed the power in Mexico, in the central government, which meant that Texas now could no longer rule itself, that it had to, that it was ruled directly by the central government in Mexico. You guys follow me here? And that meant that they had to get rid of their slaves. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? Now, I should mention in terms of. I mean, you don't know a lot about mexican history, but I do, right. That when the centralists took over, Texas declares independence. But Texas isn't the only place. There were a number of different states in Mexico that declared independence because they were. Because they felt that their power had been curtailed with this idea of the. What sort of. I'm looking for centralist government taking power away from the states. Okay? But what happens in Texas is that the Americans in Texas declare independence, and then they vote they create a government, a constitutional government, and they apply for admission to the United States. Okay? Now I want to mention a couple things here about that. The first one is when Texas declared independence, they declared their territory to consist of everything north of the Rio Bravo. And I don't know if you guys will remember, but a couple of weeks ago, we talked about how the border of Texas was understood always to be at the Nueces, and everybody agreed on that. The United States agreed on that. Mexico agreed on that. France agreed on that. England agreed on that. Everybody agreed that this was the border of Texas. When Texas declared independence, they said the border was at the Rio Bravo. Why did they say that? Well, the reason why was because, if you guys will recall, when they were negotiating the Treaty of Adams Onis, which was negotiating the treaty between the United States and Mexico over the boundary, that the United States had opened its arguments with the. The. With the Rio Bravo or the Rio Grande. And. And that was an open kind of bargaining chip. Right? And at the end, they settled for the boundary here at the Sabine. Okay, you guys are with me. So, from the point of view of. After the Treaty of Adams Onis, from the point of view of the United States, the border of Texas was at the Nueces. Actually, from the point of view of both the United States and Mexico, the border of Texas was at the Nueces, and the border of the United States was at the sabine and the red, and that the real Bravo wasn't anything. Okay, you guys, follow me here. You guys need to pay attention, because this is going to be important in a minute. It's a little complicated, but it's important. Okay, so. So Texas declares that its border is at the Rio Bravo, and then that's when you're going to see the invasion of Texas from Mexico, led by Santa Ana. Santa Ana was President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, and he leads an army into Texas to try to force Texas back into compliance, I guess, or into union with Mexico City. And he's defeated. He wins Adelaide, the Alamo. You guys have all. You guys have all heard of the Alamo, and if you've ever been there, you'll see that it's like a shrine where Texans celebrate their freedom, and we'll just leave it at that for now. But at any rate, the Mexicans won the battle at the Alamo, but they lost the battle at another place just near Houston called San Jacinto. The mexican army was defeated. Santa Anna was captured, and he was forced to sign a document recognizing the independence of Texas. Okay, so Texas becomes independent, theoretically, in 1836, even though what happens after that is that Santa Ana is freed. And then he denies that. He actually. He said he signed the paper under duress. And they. And everybody in Mexico denies that Texas is independent. And every mexican government swears that they're going to eventually force Texas back into the union, but they can't do it right now because they're too busy fighting each other. Okay, so the political unrest in Mexico prevents any trying to force Texas back into union, but at the same time, everybody in Mexico believes that Texas is part of the mexican territory. You guys follow what I'm saying? And it's a big political issue. If anybody ever says, in Mexico only just let Texas go, they're considered to be a traitor. And any government that considers giving up Texas can't last.",442

","What was the major outcome of the mexican american war? What did the United States win? Texas and California. Texas and California and all the. All the area in between. It was a really enormous area of land that the United States won. Now, just keep that in mind, and let me ask you this other question. If you're thinking about us politics in the 1840s, what is the big issue? Free states or slave states? Right. Slave versus free. Okay. So now these two ideas are going to come together after the mexican american war, because now the United States has a whole. An enormous amount of territory that they need to figure out how they're going to use it. And one of the things that happens when Congress addressed the issue was there was a man from Pennsylvania named David Wilmot, and he introduced a. We'll call it the Wilmot proviso. And what it really is is something that was tacked on to a bill that would incorporate the newly gained territories into the United States. But what the Wilmot proviso called for was the abolition, or the. Well, I guess we should say abolition. Not really, but that the new territory that was gained could not be slave territory. Okay. Now, why would that be a problem? Let's take a look at the map here. Right? You can't see the screen. I'm sorry. I do that more often than not. Okay, so let's take a look at the map here. And this is the territory. Texas, New Mexico, Utah, and California. Actually, Texas was really already part of the United States. Right. And so we added all of this new territory here. Right. But what would be a reason why people would think that this territory should be open to slavery? Where had the United States. Because it's below the. That line. The. Okay, yeah. The Missouri compromise line. So if you guys remember the Missouri compromise, the Missouri compromise was where the Ohio river meets the Mississippi river, and all the way west, slavery was forbidden north of that territory, but not south. But if you'll recall, United States didn't own any territory south of that. It was all part of the spanish empire. Right? So now it's now part of the United States, and it's south of the territory. Right. Why can't the United States. Why can't slavery exist in these new territories? Okay. And this becomes a huge question. This becomes a political issue that people can't. People can't. The Congress can't move forward with incorporating this territory because they can't. The Congress is broken, divided over the issue of slavery.",511

","We're going to talk about World War two today, and we can't really talk about World War two without talking about World War one, because a lot of the events that were set in motion by the Treaty of Versailles and World War one are going to be contributing factors to World War two. So some people argue that the time between World War one and World War two was just a pause in the same war. I disagree with that because, I mean, yeah, there is an aspect of that that is correct, but there's also the fact that World War two really wasn't one war. It was really three wars. It was a war between the western allies and Japan and a war between the western allies and Germany and a war between the Soviet Union and Germany. So really three different wars happening at the same time. All right, questions? Comments? So let's go now and think about, well, what are the events that lead up to this? And the first thing we have to say is that, if you will recall, american foreign policy always was isolationist, that the united states didn't get involved in world affairs. The only time that Americans would get involved in world affairs would be if its trading relationships were threatened. And it's pretty much what we saw with World War one. But at the end of the war, even though the Americans won, most people in all of the countries that had fought world War one believed it was a huge mistake, and the world kind of fell into an emotional depression after the war. It was an era when people just thought that the whole thing had been a massive waste, and Americans definitely felt that way. So Americans didn't want to continue their involvement in world affairs. They wanted to go back into isolationism. And they did, actually. And one of the things that will happen politically, we see that Roosevelt beat Hoover, and for a period of time between 1932 and 1938, Congress was controlled by Democrats. So we had the Congress and the presidency controlled by Democrats. But then after 19, I think it was actually 1936, the Republicans took control of the Congress, and they were very much against the idea of getting involved in another war. And so they passed laws that committed the United States to neutrality. But the United States was not going to get involved in any wars. And most people were actually on board with this. Most people thought that was a fine idea. Roosevelt, the president, actually wasn't on board with it because he saw basically two different problems happening. One was that american interests were being threatened in the Pacific, and the other was that democracy itself was being threatened in Europe. And Wilson. Excuse me, sorry. Roosevelt was very much a wilsonian diplomat, meaning that he believed in missionary diplomacy, that the United States had a mission to extend and protect democracy. And so when we look then at what was going on in the Pacific, as I'll kind of describe to you here in a minute, we can see that America had economic interests that were being threatened in the Pacific, and also American had ideological interests that were being threatened in Europe. And Roosevelt believed that the United States would eventually have to get involved in a war. All right, well, we'll just leave it there, except to say that he started to make arrangements for that, even while the congress was passing laws for american neutrality. And you can. You can actually watch reading the book about how the United States kind of comes out of that, that isolationist shell even before Pearl harbor. But one thing that we need to understand, it's a link between the Japanese and the Germans, and that there was a treaty, an agreement between Germany, Japan, and Italy called the tripartite Pact. And the treaty was really aimed at the Soviet Union, because both Germany and Japan saw the Soviet Union as a threat, and Italy was on board because they were allied with Germany. Right. But the consequence of that was that everybody knew that if the United States went to war with Japan or if Japan went to war with the United States, then Germany would also declare war on the United States. Okay, so there was. This is something that is out in the open. Everybody knows this is going to happen. All right? Questions? Comments? Okay. All right. So now, in the Pacific, one of the things that had happened in the Pacific was that Japan was a rising industrial nation. Japan had forced industrialization on the end part of the 19th century, but Japan was an industrial power, like the british industrial powers, meaning that it had a powerful industrial plant, but they didn't have access to resources, and they had to get those resources elsewhere. Japan acted like the european imperialists and sought control over different places in Asia where they could gain their resources. But with that power, the rising industrial power, they were also becoming a rising military power. And really their only rival in the Pacific was the United States. The United States was by this time the world's greatest industrial power. And the United States had interest in the. In Asia, particularly in the philippine islands, because the United States owned the philippine islands. So the difference between Japan and the United States, industrially or economically, was that Japan did not have control of its resources, and the United States did, because the United States had all of its resources on the north american continent. And so that made Japan dependent on imperialism. And one of the things that they did then, as a result of the Great Depression, the military took control of the government and said, well, we're going to supply our industry with resources by invading other countries. And so they invade Manchuria, they invade China, and then they set out on, of course, their plan, their stated plan was to conquer essentially all of Asia, right, to use it as their kind of empire for contributing to their industrial plant. All right, so the Japanese are threatening in Asia, and Roosevelt, as president, realizes this is a threat to american interests in the Philippines. And so the tensions are going to, in the 1930s will be rising between the United States and Japan. And eventually what will happen is that the United States will declare an embargo against Japan. And what that means is that Japan can't buy goods from the United States. But the problem is that the japanese economy depends on goods from the United States, wood and steel in particular. And so if the United States stops selling those, those resources to Japan, that means they have to get them somewhere else. And so what will happen then is that Japan will come up with a plan. They'll make a decision that they're going to accomplish one massive offensive throughout the Pacific and take over essentially all of the Pacific, and then they're going to declare that to the world as a fait accompli. Keeping in mind now that at this point, the western powers have demonstrated that they're not really willing to enforce the punitive aspects of the treaty of Versailles. You guys follow me here. Questions? And so the Japanese think, well, you know, the Americans are in depression, and the other countries aren't really willing to back up their threats that were made with the treaty of Versailles. So we'll just do this, and we'll present it to the world as a fait un compli. And that means a done deal. And that after that, we'll get away with it. Essentially, nobody will respond. You guys follow me here. But they were afraid that just, they didn't know, and they were afraid that the United States might respond. And they knew that the United States fleet was at Pearl harbor, and so they decided, as part of their offensive, that they would bomb Pearl harbor with the idea that if they bombed Pearl harbor and crippled the American Pacific fleet, that would discourage the Americans from getting involved. Okay? So as part of their expansion in Asia, they took over basically everything that's inside the green here. Right. And at the same time, they bombed Pearl harbor, and they did actually cripple the american fleet. But that didn't discourage the Americans. It enraged the Americans. Right. And so what the attack on Pearl harbor did was it changed american public opinion from isolationism and neutrality to being totally in favor of war against the Japanese, and at the same time, it brought Germany into the war against the United States. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So are you supposed to be sharing your screen? Am I not sharing the screen? No, I'm sorry. I don't. I always do that. Why do I always do that? Yeah, I heard in the green, and I was like, we're supposed to be looking at something right now, right? Okay. Yeah. Well, hopefully you were learning a lot from just my talking, but actually, this is what we were looking at, the map here. So the Japanese have. Have expanded throughout this area. That's inside the green here. You guys get what I'm saying? And that includes the Philippines. So the Japanese took over the Philippines, but the strategy, the gamble that they took was that if they bombed Pearl harbor and crippled the american fleet, that would keep the United States out of war. But in reality, it had exactly the opposite effect, because Americans were enraged. And so Americans changed their attitude from one of neutrality to one in favor of a war against Japan. And at the same time, because of the tripartite pact, Germany declares war on the United States. Okay, you guys are with me. So now the United States is involved in two wars, one in Europe and one in the Pacific. All right, questions? Comments? With a Pearl harbor, like, how big was the. Like, how many ships were there? How much damage the actual Navy did they intend to do? Was it, like, more morale, or was it more trying to do damage to the navy? No, actually, most. Most of the american fleet was there, and most of the american fleet was destroyed. And so the United States really did take a big hit at Pearl harbor in terms of its military capability in the Pacific. The counterbalance to that was that the United States had a very efficient industrial plant that could be quickly fit to produce war material. So the United States could. Even though they had. There were a number of ships that were destroyed, Americans could actually produce ships faster than the Japanese could destroy them. Right. There was a period of time when the United States was actually launching a destroyer every day. Right? Do you follow what I'm saying here? And so because of that, even though the fleet was crippled, the United States could overcome that. And one of the advantages that the United States had over Japan was that their industrial plant wasn't. That wasn't big enough to do that. So when the United States destroyed japanese ships, they couldn't replace them. It took too long for them to replace them. So the american fleet kept growing. Actually, the american war machine kept growing. Bigger and bigger and bigger over the course of the war, as the Japanese. As the japanese ability to make war kept decreasing.",511

","This is going to be another instance of when the southern states are going to threaten to secede from the union. Okay. Because they're going to say, well, let's. Let's go back and remember, why is it that the slave states were so adamant about adding new slave states? Why did the south. Because it helped them. It helped them politically and also economically. Well, politically is mostly the thing. Right. You're right. The idea here is that if you add new states, then you add new representatives and you add new senators. Right. And remember that one of the outcomes of the Missouri compromise was what was called parity. P a r I t y. What is parity? I might be a tad bit wrong, but isn't it like, kind of like the idea that, you know, they wanted some. The same representation that the non slave states were getting in the government. Right. Exactly. You're absolutely right. What part of the government did the south have? Have parity in legislative. Right. Which part of the legislative delegates. Almost. Try it again. Senators. Right. Because remember, they have an equal number of representatives from. In the Senate from each state, but a different number of representatives. Right. And the problem that the south had was that the population of the north was growing and the population of the south was stagnant. So that meant that the north was getting more and more representation in the House, but they could maintain parity in the Senate. Right. It's kind of like the Senate the way it is today. Right. With even split between the number of senators. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right. Okay. So now the idea then, that slavery can't advance into this new territory is going to break the government and the south is going to threaten to secede. So a number of people come together and they work on a compromise. And I want to talk about the four different approaches to solving the problem that were evident in this. In this compromise that came about as a result of the Wilmot proviso. And the first, there's basically four different people in american government at the time. All right. So Henry Clay, who was from Kentucky, said that what was really important was the union, and that in order to save the union, if you had to allow the expansion of slavery, that was fine. Okay. So Henry Clay said, we don't care if slavery expands or maybe we don't like it, but we think that the saving the union is more important, and so we should compromise on that issue. That's going to be one point of view. Okay, guys, with me, the next one, John Calhoun. We've already heard of John Calhoun. Before. Right. What do we know from John about John Calhoun? He thought that bringing in the Mexicans would ruin everything and weaken the United States. Okay. That's true. Okay. That is the last time we heard about him. We also heard about him when he was talking about how after South Carolina had passed its nullification, ordinance of nullification, that the south could see from the union if the union was imposing policies that were bad for the state or they wouldn't have to follow it. So that was back in the 1830s. And what we said was that John Calhoun, who was from. Does anybody remember what state he was from? Because I said this state that he was from was the kind of poster child for the white supremacist secessionist outlook of the South. South Carolina. Exactly. South Carolina. So John Calhoun is right there on the screen from South Carolina. Right. And he says that the issue of slavery is states rights, and that if basically the way that the people in the south think about this or not everybody but most people, many people think about this, is that the issue of slavery isn't an issue of morality. It's an issue of property. Okay. And if we'll recall going back to the american revolution, what is the purpose of government? To protect property. Property. Exactly. So when we read Locke, Locke said that if the government. If the purpose of government is to protect property and the government doesn't protect your property, but instead takes it away from you, what should you do? Rebel. Rebel. You should get rid of that government and establish a new government. And that was the. The justification for the american revolution. That's what we read about in the Declaration of Independence. Right. You guys are all with me. Okay, so what. What John Calhoun and the people of south are saying, that slaves are not people. Slaves are property. And that if the federal government is trying to limit our ability to own property or to take our property away from us, then we have a right to change the government. And the precedent was the american revolution. You guys follow what I'm saying here? This makes sense to you guys. So then, from Calhoun's point of view, there can be no compromise on the issue of slavery. And here's one place where he said it. It was in the Senate. Right. The south has no compromise to offer but the constitution and no concession or surrender to make. She has already surrendered so much that she has little left to surrender. Such a settlement would go, the settlement says, allowing slave states. Right. Such a settlement would go to the root of the evil and remove all cause of discontent. By satisfying the south that she could remain honorably and safely in the union by abandoning any limit or any attempt to limit or restrict slavery, and thereby restore the harmony and fraternal feelings between the sections which existed anterior to the Missouri agitation, which is Missouri compromise. Nothing else can with any certainty, finally and forever settle the question at issue. Terminate agitation, which means the threat to terminate slaver, to end slavery or abolish slavery or limit slavery and save the union. Okay, so this is part of that debate that we're talking about in 1850. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions, comments about this. All right, so now let's go back and what was Henry Clay's idea? How should we solve the problem? Compromise. Compromise. What is John Calhoun's solution? No. Compromise. Don't compromise. Exactly. Now, there's another guy, Daniel Webster, who's from Massachusetts, and he's going to say it's very important to save the union, and that the way to do that is not to legislate on slavery. Let. Let slavery go wherever it will, because it won't go everywhere. Right. So, for example, if you think about the purpose, the use of slavery in the south, what was slavery used for? Plantations. Plantations. Exactly. So now, how many plantations, how many cotton plantations do you think they're going to set up in the California mountains or in the Arizona desert? They're not, right? So what Webster says is, well, where the places where it could go, it might go, but where it can't go, it won't go. There's a natural limit to where slavery will be useful. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? So that's his input, I guess, to the conversation. And then the last guy you may have heard of, Stephen Douglas, senator from Illinois, he had you. You may. Where you had heard of him before was from the Lincoln Douglas debates. He had a famous series of debates with Abraham Lincoln, but his idea is popular sovereignty. Okay, so popular sovereignty means let the people decide. Okay, so if we make a new territory, and the people that move into the territory apply for statehood as a slave state, then if they chose that, we should allow that. Right? This is the most american point of view. The most american point of view is let the people decide. If they want slavery, that's fine. If they don't want slavery, that's fine, too. You guys get what I'm saying? It seems like the most american point of view. The problem, we're going to see what the problem is in a few minutes. But now let's look at how they finally compromised is called the compromise of 1850. Why do you think they call it the compromise of 1850? Because it happened in 1850. Because it happened in 1850. Good. All right. So now here's what they call the compromise is the compromise is there's a new fugitive slave law. Now. Let me just talk briefly about the fugitive slave law. The fugitive slave law was a law that made it illegal to assist a slave who had escaped from their master in the south, right? So now the way that it was viewed by the south was that slaves were property and that if somebody helped a slave escape, that was assisting in grand theft. Okay? Keeping in mind that the price of a slave was equivalent to what we would think of as the price of a car today, right? So what they're saying is that, well, this slave is my property, and if you try to help my property to escape, which is kind of odd for us to think about it, the car tries to escape by itself because you're a bad driver. Right. And somebody helps the car, somebody drives it, let's say, right, then you're assisting in grand theft. That makes sense to you guys? So that's the way the south looked at it. The north. Many people in the north. Now, not a lot, not everybody, but a lot of people in the north are starting to think of slavery as a moral evil, right? And so there is no compromise on a moral evil. But if we're thinking about slaves as property, then we have to say, well, okay, that if somebody helps my property to escape, then they should be prosecuted. That's what the fugitive slave law was. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? And they had had one before, but it wasn't really enforced very well. So the southern states were demanding that the north enforce this law vigorously. Okay, you guys with me? Questions? Comments? All right, so that's one. Ask one. One of the issues of the compromise, the next one. California is admitted as a free state. California had already formed a government and asked for admission as a free state, but its admission to the union was actually held up by this debate over the inclusion of the territory. But California then is admitted as a free state. And New Mexico and Utah, these two territories here, are to be admitted by popular sovereignty. What does that mean again? They get to popular vote, right? Let the people decide. Okay. And then they fixed the western boundary of Texas. If you guys remember the map that I showed you last week, Texas believed that their territory went all the way up into here, but the Congress fixed the western boundary of Texas to where it is today, which is basically where Mexico had fixed the boundary between Texas and New Mexico. Right? And then. And then they abolished the slave trade in Washington DC, but not slavery, which means that you can own a slave in Washington DC, but you can't buy and sell slaves in Washington DC. Okay, you guys are with me. So that's their compromise. And the compromise actually works to keep the union together for another ten years or so.",512
86,"US1: 513 -US1: 513
","We're going to go ahead then, and we're going to think about some other issues having to do with this new territory. So this was the result of the compromise of 1850. Okay. What we want to do is think about what was the purpose of the mexican american war? Why did Polk want the territory in California? Why did Polk want California? So you could do overseas trade with China. Right, trade with China. And the reason why was because San Francisco was a great natural harbor, and if the United States could trade with China from San Francisco, that would give them a leg up on the Europeans. Right? But the problem is, once you get goods to California from China, how are you going to get it to the east, where all the people are? And the answer to that was, well, if you were going to do it by sea, you had to go all the way around South America to do it. There's no Panama Canal. Right? So. So how are you going to get the goods from, actually Sacramento to, say, Chicago, the east? Are you going to do that? Railroads. Exactly. But here's the problem. Think about this. If you are going to build a railroad, keep in mind that railroads are very. They're high tech. They're like space shuttles today. Right? Okay, so you're going to build a high tech railroad. In fact, Americans didn't know how to build railroads. They had to hire british companies to do it. Right, but you're going to build a railroad from, say, Chicago to Sacramento, but it's going to go across territory that's unorganized, where that's occupied by hostile natives. Is that going to seem like a reasonable investment? Do you think it would be a good idea to invest in a really high tech project? That's going to be. It's going to go through unorganized territory that's occupied by hostile natives? No. No. All right, so that's when Congress decides to. To organize what was left of the Louisiana purchase. Okay? And that's this territory that you see here. They divided into two territories, Nebraska and Kansas. Okay? And when Kansas was. Was made a territory, it was decided that it would be admitted by popular sovereignty. Right? Popular sovereignty means that whatever they decide, whether they want to be slaver free, they can be admitted. Okay? Now let's think about and see if we can remember. How is it that states are incorporated into the union before I. Well, let me just say this, okay? States are incorporated into the union according to the Northwest ordinance, which was written before the Constitution, and in that it specifies that the congress creates a territory and appoints a governor, and then people move into the territory, and once they have reached a certain population, then they have a congress, write a constitution, and then they could. And they can apply for admission to the union. And then when they do apply, they even reply to slaver free. Okay, at this point, you guys are following me here. That's how it works. There's only 15 states that weren't added to the union that way. The original 13 colonies were directly part of the United States. What were the other two states? What were the other two states that never became a territory before they were admitted to the union? Was one of them Louisiana? No, Louisiana was a territory. How about doing this? Take a look. Just look down at the floor. Florida. What? I said look down at the floor. What state is that? California. California was one of them. California. Was it already Oregon? No, not Oregon. If we've learned about it already, the Alamo and the Republic of Texas. Texas. Right. So Texas and California were the only other two states that were added without being a territory. Okay, because you're with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so now they pass this Kansas Nebraska act. Kansas is organized as a territory. People start to move in. All right? Now, it says here, supported by southerners and denounced by northerners. Okay, that's true. Right? Why would it be supported by southerners? Why would the Kansas Nebraska act be supported by slave interests? Because Nebraska is above the Missouri compromise line. Well, we're talking about Kansas now, but, yeah, Kansas is above that line and because of popular sovereignty. What does that mean? Can Kansas be a slave state? It could be if people choose. Right? It could be if people choose. Okay. All right, so slave interests are going to be interested in that because they think that Kansas could possibly be a slave state, but northerners are going to be against it. And why would they be against it? Because they hold abolitionist views and they're above. And they see it as being above the Missouri compromise. Well, the first one is not that big of a deal. All right, so there are a number of abolitionists. There's. Abolitionism is kind of a new, I guess you could say, attitude among many people in the north. But most people don't care about slavery one way or the other. Right. Because it doesn't affect them. The major problem with admitting new voting states has to do with representation in Congress. Right? Exactly. Okay, so. And then it erases the Missouri compromise line. All right, so we just leave it at that. Okay, you guys are with me. But here's the problem. The problem is that because it's going to be settled by popular sovereignty, then both the slave interest and the free interests have incentive to send more people who are in favor of or opposed to slavery if you guys are with me. And so what happens is that there is a mass movement of people from both the north and the south into Kansas, with the idea being that whoever can get the most people living there will be able to choose whether it's slave or free. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, well, here's the problem. That it's going to become obvious to these people that neither side is going to be able to gain a meaningful advantage over the other in terms of numbers. And so the next best thing is to kill everybody on the other side. So what happens is that there's a war that breaks out in Kansas in the late 1850s between slave interests and free interests. Okay? So you can kind of think about it as the civil war has already started. Before the civil war started, it's because they're already fighting about this in Kansas, and the slave interests are sending troops and weapons, and the. The free interests are also sending troops and weapons, and it becomes brutal. That's why they call it bleeding Kansas. You guys following a fan? Questions about this? All right, now, how many of you guys have heard of John Brown? That. See, that's discouraging to me because a John Brown was a very important individual in american history. He was probably mostly seen by most of the good people as a criminal, right? But. And he was actually, if you think about it, he was a rabid abolitionist, meaning that he was absolutely uncompromising on the issue that slavery should be abolished. And his idea of how to abolish slavery was to kill all the slave owners. Right. So in Kansas, he becomes very important as a leader of the abolitionists. And he and his sons are involved in an incident called the Pottawatomie Creek massacre, where they actually murder a bunch of slave owners with axes. Right. Okay, so now, if you guys have looked at this picture probably every day before you start the class, because this is the image, I guess, for this course, this guy standing here in the middle. Who is he? That's John Brown. And this is a great, actually, image of the issue of bleeding Kansas. It was done earlier. It's called tragic prelude. Prelude to what? Prelude to the Civil War, which you can see already the. The Union forces and the confederate forces fighting against each other. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this?",513
87,"US1: 514 -US1: 514
","So now let's talk about the political parties here. Okay. And you guys will remember that the first party system was democratic Republicans Jefferson and Federalist Hamilton, and that the federalist party lost influence after the war of 1812 because the federalists were in New England and they were against the War of 1812. And the Americans won the War of 1812, right? Yes. Americans thought they had won the war. Why did they think they had won the war? It has to do with two things. The Treaty of Ghent and the battle of New Orleans. So what was the Treaty of Ghent? It was the peace treaty that ended the war. Okay. And what was. What was the. What was the settlement? Who won? Who won what? Who won? Who lost what? Everything stayed the same at the end. Exactly. So that means that the United States didn't win, but it didn't lose. Right. Americans thought they won because what did they hear about before they heard about the treaty? I just told you what it was. Andrew Jackson won the battle of New Orleans. Exactly. So they thought that was the thing that ended the war and that the Americans had won. And that leads to the era of good feelings, as we talked about before. Right. So, anyway, because the federalists had been against the war, then they really lost influence after the war was over. And then there was a period of time when there wasn't any party system until Andrew Jackson comes along, and then there's going to be two parties. The Democrats were kind of the original democratic Republicans. Kind of. Right. And the Whigs. And do you guys remember who the Whigs are now? This is not that long ago, and it has absolutely everything to do with Andrew Jackson. Who are the wigs? So Andrew Jackson was a very popular politician in Washington. Right? I mean, the establishment political establishment really loved him. Right? No, they hated him. So they formed this new party called the Whigs. Remember that? The Whig party was the party in England that was anti monarchy. So now we have an american political party that's named after an anti monarchy party in England. Why would they name themselves that? Which monarchy are they against? The american monarchy? Which was. Who was the king? Andrew Jackson. King Andrew. Exactly. All right, so, so then what really binds the wigs together? They come from the north and from the south and from the west. And the thing that really binds them together is what? Their hatred over Andy Jackson. Right. They hate Jackson. Okay, so now we're in the 1850s. Where's Jackson? Dead. He's dead. Exactly. So what's going to hold the Whig party together? Well, nothing really. Nothing, really. And keep in mind then, that american politics wasn't really party politics, it was really regional politics. Right. North, south and west. So there's northern Whigs, southern Whigs. Right. And western Whigs and the northern Whigs and southern Whigs are. They were united in their. In their opposition to Jackson, but they're divided in everything else having to do with tariffs and, you know, National bank and things like that. Right. So by the time we get to the 1850s, the Whig party is still there, but it just doesn't have any. Any cohesion, I guess you could say. And there's a number of other parties that are going to appear at this time. One of them is going to be called the american party, and one of the groups. One of you guys groups is working on irish immigration. Right. And the american party was formed as a political party to oppose immigration from Ireland and to oppose Catholicism. Right. Okay, so. So it's kind of a prelude to what we see today. But at any rate, the point here is that there's really. The political situation is in turmoil, I guess you could say. So, in 1854, a bunch of northern Whigs come together and form a new party called the Republican Party, named after the democratic Republicans. Right. And their main organizing issue is going to be to limit the expansion of slavery. Okay. Now, it's not to get rid of slavery. They don't say they're going to get rid of slavery. They say they're going to limit the expansion of slavery, which means that slavery can continue to exist where it does exist, but it won't be allowed anywhere else in the future. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Now, one of the reasons why is because one of the new political parties that helped to form the republican party was a. Was a political party from New York called the Free Soil Party. And the free soil party was in favor of what? Free soil. Right. Meaning that we won't add any more slave territory. Okay, so the thing that we want to keep in mind now is that the major issue of the Republicans, actually, they have two issues. Their main concern is to be the supporters of big business and commerce, but their other issue is going to be the limiting the expansion of slavery. So on the one hand, they're going to be the party of big business, and that's where the republican party is today, or has been. Right. And on the other hand, they're going to be the socially liberal party, actually more like socially radical. Right. And if you think about today, right, the Republicans in 1854 would be like the progressive wing of the Democratic Party today. You guys are with me. So we'll see how that all changes later. But the point here is that the Republican Party is the party of big business, but it's also the party of social reform. And that reform has to do with limiting the expansion of slavery. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so in 1856, there's a presidential election. The election is between John Fremont, who was an army officer, who had come to California, was president at the Bear flag rebellion, and he's going to run as the republican candidate. Millard Fillmore is the american party candidate. I already told you what the american party stood for. What was that again? The other name for this party was the know nothing party. Right. And the reason why is if you ask them what they believed in, say they'd say, I know nothing. Right. Kind of like Sergeant Schultz. So what was it that they were in favor of, and what was it they were against? I just told you not even five minutes ago. Remember, we talked. I talked earlier about irish immigration. I said, one of your projects is about irish immigration. Right? Were they for or against irish immigration? Against it. Against. And why were they against it? Too many people were coming over, and they were flooding the job market. Okay? That's part of their taking away our jobs. That's part of it. Plus, they talked funny, and they were Catholic. Right? And Americans. Many Americans believe that catholicism was against Americanism because Americans. Because Catholics theoretically obey the pope, right? Okay. So the american party would be really the first example of what we would call a nativist party. Have you guys heard of nativism? There's, like, a couple weeks ago, there's a congresswoman from, I think, Florida. I'm not sure where she's from, but she proposed to start a new caucus in Congress called the America first caucus. And the America first caucus was based on the idea that America should be ruled by anglo saxon political traditions. Is there a problem with that? What do you guys think? We're made up of a lot more than that. Okay? So if you want to restrict Americanism or restrict being american to anglo saxon peoples, who, by the way, were illegal immigrants to England back in the fourth century, right. Then you would call that nativism, right? Nativism is, if you're not from here, you don't belong here. It's actually. I mean, it's something that you see everywhere in many other places in the world. The problem in the United States is that nobody's from here. We're all from somewhere. Right? You get what I'm saying? But nevertheless, this is going to be a big issue in the 1840s and 1850s is we don't want those damn foreigners coming over here. Right. Okay, so. And particularly not Catholics. All right? So at any rate, the point here is that this guy runs as on the ticket for the american party, and then the representatives for the south is going to be, or, excuse me, for the Democratic Party is going to be Buchanan. All right? Many people have said that they think Buchanan was probably the worst president, right. And the reason why he wins the presidency is going to be because the Republican, the rest of the electorate was essentially divided. Okay? And so he wins the presidency. But the one thing that we want to keep in mind is that the Republican Party. What was their, what was their platform again? Big business and free soil. Free soil. Which means what? You're right. Absolutely. Limit. Limit the expansion of slavery. Right. Limit the expansion of slavery. Okay, so the Republicans get no support. They're not even on the ballot in the south. Now, why is that? Because people in the south want to expand slavery. Exactly. All right. Okay. So we got to keep that in mind here.",514

","Now we're going to move forward to the election of 1860. Right. In 1860, the republican party chooses Lincoln as their, as their standard bearer. And the, again, the Republicans stand for no expansion of slavery. Okay. Now we'll just leave it at that for now. We'll talk more about it next on Wednesday. But anyway, in 1860, the Lincoln and the Republicans run on the issue of no expansion of slavery. Democratic party divides essentially into three different parties, northern Democrats, southern Democrats. There's actually two democratic current party conventions. And then there's another party that forms called the Constitutional Union Party, which essentially just means Tennessee and Kentucky and Virginia. Right. And so out of all that, because the opposition to the Republicans is so divided, republican party wins. Right. But keep in mind that the republican party isn't even on the ballot in the south. Right. So now if you're living in the south and your big issue is the expansion of slavery or slavery, right. And you see the federal interest in slavery as being against the constitution, and now you see somebody who actually stands for limiting the expansion of slavery elected to the presidency with no votes from the south. What does that make you think about being some from the south? How much influence do you actually have now in the national government? None. None. And so from that point of you, then they say, well, if we can't, we don't have any influence at all in the national government. There's no point in us even being in the government. You guys follow I'm saying? And so then states start to secede from the union. Which state do you think is the first one to secede? North Carolina. Which one? South Carolina. South Carolina, exactly. And why is that? Because you can't go any further south than South Carolina in terms of the issues of the civil war. Right. So anyway, before Lincoln is inaugurated, keep in mind that inauguration happened in March, then not in January. Right. But before Lincoln is inaugurated, seven states are already going to have seceded from the south. Okay. And I'm not sure it's going to be North Carolina. South Carolina, Georgia, Florida. 123-4567 I guess it's not North Carolina. But anyway, Texas was one. At any rate, the south has already succeeded. They've passed ordinances of secession. Okay, Jen, I'm going to post a document here for you that you can look at. What you'll notice in the ordinance of secession is that they almost all state as their reason for secession, states rights. But they also pretty specifically mentioned that the right that they are defending is the right to own people as property. Right. So there's a kind of a trope, I guess, that you can say has come about in the 20th century about the civil war not really being about slavery but really being about states rights. Right. And you can say that, but you can't say states rights without saying slavery because that's the right that they were defending and they said it themselves, outlaw out loud, openly in their ordinances. Right. So I'm gonna go ahead and I'll give you a document you guys can read and then you can comment on that. All right? And so let's just say right now states have already started to secede, but there are still efforts in Congress to try to come up with a compromise to keep the states in the union. Okay? So we'll just leave it right there and then Wednesday we'll come back and we'll pick it up with the civil war. All right. Questions, comments about any of this.",515

","So now, here's the thing. If you go to the Barnes and noble today, I actually believe it's still open here in Encinitas. I can't believe anybody still goes to bookstores. But at any rate, if you go to the Barnes and noble and you go into the history section, you will find one shelf of books about World War two, one shelf of books about everything else, and all the rest of the shelves are going to be filled with books about the civil War. Civil war is one of the most studied eras in world history. And so the idea that in something around an hour, we're going to talk about the civil War is really ridiculous. There's no way we can come even close to covering it. But I do want to take a kind of a 50,000 foot view of it to give us, to put it in context with the rest of the class that we've been leading up to this, really, since the very beginning. All right, so that's where we're going. It's not like you're going to know very much about the civil war from listening to this lecture, but you'll have a basic idea. Okay, are you, are you guys with me? Questions, comments about anything? All right, so let's go ahead and take a look then at the north and south. Okay, but let me just mention, one of the things that occurred to me this morning as I was thinking about doing this lecture was we had talked earlier when we talked about the, the election of 1800, how compromise was necessary for democracy to survive. That if Jefferson had not been able to compromise with Hamilton, the country would have died in 1800. But they both were able to make very hard compromises, and because of that, the country survived. We have here a situation where there's a great divide between regions of the country, the north and the south. And there's really fundamental differences in the economies and the culture, the north and the south, that we've already spent some time talking about. The north was an industrial, manufacturing, commercial economy, engaged in world trade, and the south was a plantation, kind of a traditional plantation economy, engaged in export agriculture. So the policies of the country, of the national government tended to favor the north because the population of the north was greater than the population of the south. And the south then believed that because of that, that they were really getting short shrift and being part of this union. And, and if you guys will recall, I mean, going back to the very beginning, the fact that there was a union at all was, I mean, there was a lot of reluctance on the part of particularly the southern states to join in this union, and there's no way they would have joined into the union if they had thought they couldn't get out of it. Right, but that's been a theme, something that we've been looking at over the. Over, really, the last several weeks. And so what happens is that there's a hardening of sentiment between the north and the south, and the hardening of the sentiment is going to focus on slavery. And the reason why slavery becomes the issue is because the north is. The economy of the north is not dependent on slavery like the economy of the south is. And there is a growing sentiment among people that slavery is a moral evil, particularly people in the north. And so the issue of the expansion of slavery and even the abolition of slavery has been a growing issue over the entire period of time that the United States has existed. And remember that the United States was really the first application of the principles of the enlightenment. And the enlightenment includes the idea that all men are created equal, and that, therefore, there should be no slavery. There's no such thing as an inferior person who should be owned by somebody else. All right, so this is a. It's not just an american movement. It's actually the abolitionist movement started in England, but it's. By the time we get to the 1850s, it's. It's very strong in the United States. Okay, so. So then the issue then of slavery and union becomes an issue that can't be compromised on. The south will not compromise on slavery at all. If you guys will recall, the platform of the republican party was to limit the expansion of slavery. Not to do away with slavery, but to limit the expansion of slavery. And the south will not accept that because they'll say that the United States government can't legislate on private property. They'll say that, like when the american colonies rebelled against England over the issue of taxes, which was really the government taking their property without their consent, that if you allow the federal government to legislate on the ownership of private property, that's the same exact sin, I guess you could say, on the part of the central government. So the south will not compromise on the issue of slavery in terms of union. Abraham Lincoln is elected president with the intention of saving, not saving the union, but preserving the union. And that is an issue that he refuses to compromise on. So what we have reached, then, at this point, is an impasse that the south can't compromise on slavery and the north can't compromise on union. And because there is the inability to compromise, what we see is a break. We see a war that comes out of it. You guys, you guys are following me here. Now, one of the reasons why it's so important that we study history is that we learn, theoretically, what works and what doesn't work. And if we have a national government today in which different parties refuse to compromise, we can't preserve our democracy. Do you guys follow what I'm saying here? One of the things that's emblematic of current politics is the idea that compromise has become a bad word. Compromise is something that is looked at as weakness. But in fact, if it is weakness, it's the only weakness that will keep the union together.",521
90,"US1: 522 -US1: 522
","Now, let's take a look at the two different sides here. The north. Again, the interest of Abraham Lincoln was to save the union in terms of resources. They had a larger population. They had an industrial economy, a booming industrial economy. They had industry. They could, they could manufacture things like guns and uniforms and stuff like that. And they had all the materials they needed because they controlled the west and they had the mines in Nevada and in California. And so the north had every advantage going into the war. Just like at the beginning of the American Revolution, the British had every advantage going into the war. Okay? So the strategy for the north is going to be, let's just crush them. Let's build a huge army and just crush them. And so the plan that was put in place to defeat the south at the beginning of the war was called the Anaconda plan. The anaconda is a snake, as you guys may or may not know. And the way that it kills its prey is by squeezing them to death. Right? So the idea here was that we were going to blockade the south to keep them from trading, to get money for their war effort. And at the same time, there's going to be an invasion in the west and in the east. Okay? And the idea then is to squeeze the life out of the south. That's the, that's the strategy of that, that Lincoln approved at the beginning of the war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. The problem with this is that Lincoln could not find a general to carry out his plan. And the reason for that is because the generals in the army generally were more concerned about politics than they were about winning battles. Every, all the generals in the army thought that they, or hoped that they would have a political future. And they all knew from the experience of George Washington and Andrew Jackson that the way to gain popularity is by winning battles. But the way to lose popularity is by losing battles. So they were very cautious. They did not want to fight any battles that they might lose because that would hurt their political chances. You guys are following me here. Questions? Comments? And so the result then is that Lincoln can't get the generals to execute his plan. And I'm going to show you how that works here in just a few minutes. All right. All right. So now the south, they're at every disadvantage, right? They, they have less population. Much of the population is enslaved. They don't have very much industry. There's a little bit of industry in Alabama and in Virginia. And so they're at a, they're, they're at a numerical and a strategic disadvantage. But they're fighting for their homes. One of the things that we need to keep in mind is that most of the civil war happened in the south, and that means that people were fighting to defend their homes. And it's more motivating to fight for something that's real right in front of you than it is to say, march 1000 miles from Iowa to Georgia to fight against somebody who we don't even really know what they're fighting for. Right? So the southern armies were much more motivated. Okay? And then they faced the superiority of the north or encouraged themselves with the idea that George Washington had won a war against an even greater enemy. And the reason why, according to their thinking, was because they were in the right. Okay? And the south, what we need to really understand about the south is that they believed they were on the right side. They believed they. That the issue of the abolition of slavery or the limiting of slavery was a. Was a violation of sacred property rights. Okay? And I don't know if you guys noticed, but I gave you extra credit. Right? Did you guys see the extra credit I put up? That's due next week? And there's no late, there's no late submissions on the extra credit. Right? But the extra credit talks of it. What it shows you is the declarations of causes, which is like the declarations of Independence, the southern states, okay? And each one of those calls out as a reason for secession that their rights as states had been violated by the national government or was going to be violated by the national government. Okay? And so that's where we can. We can get the. The assertion that the civil war was all about states rights. But you don't have to look very far to realize that the right that they were defending was the right to own people as property. You see what I'm saying? So you can't separate states rights from slavery. People today will say, oh, yeah, well, the south wasn't fighting to keep the slaves. The south was fighting to preserve their rights. Well, what rights? The rights to keep slaves. Right? So when people try to divert your attention from slavery as a. As the cause of the civil war, it's just smoke. They're blowing smoke. Slavery is at the very root of the cause of the civil war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? I'm gonna talk a little bit more about that in just a second. But at any rate, the point here then, is that the strategy that the south tried to implement was to just keep the war going, drag the war out, because the longer the war dragged on, the less interested people in the north were in fighting it. And that's really what had happened with the American Revolution, that the Americans just wouldn't give up. And eventually the british people said, we don't want this anymore. Just give up. And so that's going to be their strategy. And it almost works, as we're going to see before the end of today. Okay? Now, I want to just say one thing about the relationship between slavery and racism, okay? Because in the United States, slavery was race based. There were certain places. I mean, white slavery was unheard of in the United States, and. And there were places in the United States where you could not be black and not be a slave, okay? So slavery is absolutely race based in the United States, okay? Which kind of muddies the waters when we talk about racism, because we've come to think that if you're against slavery, that means you're also against racism. But this is not true, okay? That even though many people in the north now are seeing slavery as a moral evil, that doesn't mean that they recognize slaves as their equals. And in fact, most white people everywhere, the United States, see themselves as superior to black people, okay? And so when we talk about abolishing slavery, it's not necessarily true that we mean to make former slaves equal in terms of civil rights, okay? There. There were many people who believed that slavery was a moral evil, but couldn't imagine that these slaves could become equal citizens. And even Lincoln went through a phase like that where Lincoln said slavery was wrong, but he could never imagine the former slaves as being equal to white people. So his solution was to send them back to Africa. What's the problem with sending them back to Africa? Most of them have been born here, right? Yeah. They're not from Africa. They're born here. Right? That's why the 15th amendment says that in order to be a citizen, you have to be born in the United States, right? If you're born in the United States, then you're a citizen. It's for that reason that makes all of the slaves, the former slaves, citizens. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this? Okay, well, here's. Here's the thing. So anyway, the point here is then that when we talk about the animosity between the north and the south, this animosity isn't really an issue of race. It's an issue of union and property rights, okay? And those property rights center on the issue of ownership of human beings, right? And. But. And so we could say that maybe in the north. The north. People in the north were anti slavery, and people in the south were pro slavery. But in fact, generally speaking, people in the north couldn't care less about slavery. They wanted to preserve the union, and people in the south also could. Most people didn't own slaves, but they became convinced that the national government was violating states rights. Okay, you guys follow I'm saying here, but we can say that there was an equal amount of racism across the country. It's not like people in the north were not racist and people in the south were racist. Everybody was racist, okay? And that's going to be true all the way into the 20th century. Think about this. In 1952, I think, let's say 1947, Jackie Robinson was the first black player in the major leagues, right? Well, was that the southern major leagues or was that the american major leagues? You guys get what I'm saying here? And in 1952, Harry TRuman's integrated the armed services. Was that the southern armed services or was that the american armed services? You guys follow what I'm saying here? So slavery is. I mean, racism is something that's very american. It's not just in the south. Okay, you guys are all with me. Questions, comments about this. Okay? So now, the one thing about when the war started was that people in the north and the south, if there's some kind of an insanity that goes through people's minds when a war, when there's a prospect of a war, that it's going to be something really good. It's going to be really glorious. We're going to go and we're going to fight, and it's going to be like, we're going to go have a football game, and at the end of the football game, we. We're all going to gain glory, and that's going to make our lives so much better. But in fact, war is a destroyer, and it's not until you're in it that you realize how bad that it is. But there was a lot of enthusiasm, both in the north and the south, for signing up and going to war. Okay? Now, one last thing I want to do here before we move on is I want to. This slide I put together really, I think, encapsulates the differences between the north and the south that lead to the war. We've already seen this quote by John Calhoun from the south where he's saying that, that there is no. There's going to be no compromise on the issue of slavery. Right? And now this is something that you may or may not have ever heard from Abraham Lincoln where he said, this is actually toward the beginning of the war, I would save the union. I would save it in the shortest way under the constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the union will be to the union as it was. If there be those who would not save the union unless they could, at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the union unless they could, at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the union without freeing any slave, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. So now, what is Lincoln saying here? That all he really cares about is saving the union? He doesn't really care about slavery. So slavery is not his issue. His issue is union. He won't compromise on that. But the south won't compromise on the issue of slavery. Okay, you guys are with me. So this is actually just a couple of days before his death, before he was assassinated, he summed up the civil war this way. Both parties deprecated war. I mean, we thought it was a bad thing. Both parties deprecated war. But one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came.",522
91,"US1: 523 -US1: 523
","Let's talk about the war itself. And the first thing we want to really try to understand is why the war lasted so long if the north had such a great advantage. And it has to do with military leadership. As I mentioned to you before, Lincoln could not find generals who would win battles for him. Right? So one way that I've heard it described, and I think it's a good way to think about it, is to think about the military leadership of the north and south in terms of high school football. Okay? So in high school football, you have an a team and a b team or the varsity team and the JV team, something like that. You guys are with me. Right? You understand what I'm saying? Okay. And so the a team is a good team that fights the other a teams. Right. Or plays. I'm sorry. And the B team is the not so good team, but they play the other b teams, and they're all kind of on the same level. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? But in the civil war, the Union and the Confederacy both had an a team and a b team. Right? And the Union a team was Grant and Sherman. Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. Okay. And the Confederate a team was Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jackson. Okay. The Union B team was a bunch of different generals. We'll talk a bit about each one of these in a few minutes. Right. McClellan, Burnside, hooker, and Meade. Right. And the Confederate B team was another set of lesser generals. Albert Sidney, Johnson, John Bell, Hood, and there's a number of others. Right. But what you'll notice is that the Civil War is fought in two theaters. Let me just show you here. And I'm not talking about movie theaters. Right. But let's say. Let's take a look at this one right here. Right there. This is the western theater here. Right. And this is the eastern theater here. Right? So you can see that most of the battles that are fought in the eastern theater are fought in Virginia, and most of the battles that are fought in the western theater are fought in Tennessee and Georgia. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, now what we saw happen at the beginning of the war was that the Union A team was in the west, and the Confederate B team was in the west. And the Confederate a team was in the east. And the Union B team was in the east. All right? So we have a mismatch in leadership. Okay? In the west, the north has the advantage, the Union has the advantage, and in the east, the Confederacy has the advantage. Right. You guys get what I'm saying here? But now, where do most of the people in the United States live in 1861? In the north. In the east, or in the west? In the east. In the east. Exactly. All right. So. So that means that people are going to know a lot about what's going on in the east and they're not going to know as much about what's going on in the west. You follow what I'm saying here? And so what happens is, because the Confederacy is winning a number of battles in the east, people in both the north and the south will believe that the south is winning the war. All right? And even though the Union is winning enormous battles in the west, people don't realize that. Right? So up until 1863, with the battle of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, most people believed that the south was winning the war and couldn't be beaten. Okay? And that's one of the reasons why the war kept dragging on is because people believe that they were fighting a defensive war rather than an offensive war in the north, I should say.",523
92,"US1: 524 -US1: 524
","All right. So now let's just talk briefly about the progress of the war and what I've done here. You can, again, this is all on canvas. You can go look at it. But I put together a chart here with what I consider to be probably the most important moments of the civil war, keeping in mind that I've put 123-456-7789 battles here, but they were somewhere around 10,000 battles in the civil war. Right. So I'm just going to talk about the big ones. All right. And so the first one happens in right outside of Washington at a place called Manassas, Virginia. And one of the places, one of the things you'll notice is that, is that the north and the south have different names for the battles. Right? So in the north they call this first battle bull run. First bull Run. And the south calls it the Battle of Manassas. Right. Okay. And it's just because it's different people, they have different names for the creek that's there. It's Manassas Creek or Bull Run, depending on how you look at it. Right. Well, the way that this battle was fought was, and again, keep in mind that everybody thought this was going to be, you know, glorious. And so this is right outside of Washington, DC. See if I can find a map here that will show us this. I can't read my map here. I'm not sure that we're going to be able to see. But. But Manassas is right outside of Washington, DC. Right. In fact, it's really close to, it's close enough that people can go out there on their carriages. Right. And so what happened was everybody in Washington, all the kind of elite people, thought, hey, there's going to be a big battle. It's going to be cool. Let's go watch, let's pack our picnic lunches, and we'll go sit and we'll watch the battle happen and we'll watch the union win the war. What happens then is the whole, a large number of people who come out to the battlefield to be witnesses, to be an act, to be the audience. Right. Like it's going to be a football game or something. Okay. And so keeping in mind that then there the confederate troops then meet with the, with the Union troops, the confederate general in charge really is Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard. And he sets up his headquarters in the kitchen of a local farmer. The outdoor kitchen. Right. And then the Union general is Erwin McDowell. Okay. And at the beginning of the battle, the Union starts to push the Confederacy back. One of the incidents that comes out of this is that there was one group of Confederates led by the commandant of the Virginia Military Institute named Thomas Jackson, who refused to fall back, and he's going to be an inspiration to other leaders on the confederate side. One of them will cry out, look, there stands Jackson like a stone wall. And so he becomes known as. Come on, you guys. Stonewall Jackson. Stonewall Jackson, exactly. All right, so that's where that comes from. And then what happens? This is actually the first battle in history where the. Where more troops are brought to the battlefield by train in the middle of the battle, right? And that's what happens. The Confederates are able to pull up to bring in more troops, and eventually what happens is they start to push the Union troops back. But now, by this time, the spectators have come to realize that this isn't as much fun as they thought it was going to be, watching people get killed. And so they all pack up their stuff and get in their carriages and go back to Washington. But when they do that, they block the road, which means that the Union army can't withdraw in an orderly fashion, and instead, they turn around and they run. Right. So this first battle makes it look like the Union is incredibly weak and the Confederacy is incredibly strong. You guys get what I'm saying here? It really sets the kind of tone for the next couple years of the war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about any of this? One thing I should mention before we go on. And that is to say that even though the Confederates were winning battles, the Union was always winning the war, because even though the Union might lose more men or lose battle, they could always replace them because they had the population to do it. But when the south lost men, they couldn't replace them. Right? So as long as the war kept going on, the south was closer to losing because they couldn't replace their losses. Okay, just keep that in mind. All right? Okay, so now we move on to the next battle. The guy who was put in charge of the. Of the army after McDowell was a man named George McClellan. George McClellan called himself the Napoleon of the west. So that kind of shows you his sense of self, right. But it also shows us that he's very much interested in politics. Remember that Napoleon became the emperor of France, okay? So he's going to be a very cautious general, and what's going to happen is that Lincoln will order McClellan to take Richmond, and the way that he's supposed to do that is he's supposed to take his army down the Chesapeake Bay land on the Yorktown peninsula. This is the same place where the Americans won the revolutionary war and then march to take Richmond. Okay, and what happens is that McClellan organizes the army and moves it here to Virginia. But he doesn't. He doesn't actually move against Richmond. He does, but what's going to happen is that there's going to be a new leader of the confederate troops. His name is, as I mentioned, Robert E. Lee. And Robert E. Lee has dug a series of trenches around Richmond and Petersburg. We think of trench warfare. What do we usually think about? What war? World War one. Exactly. But they got the idea from Lee. All right? So at any rate, McClellan doesn't know how many troops Lee has, although he. The reality is he has many more troops than Lee. Okay? So he will keep telling, you'll kind of camp out here and he'll keep telling Lincoln, I need more troops. I need more troops, because he doesn't know how many troops Lee has. And eventually Lincoln will realize that McClellan has no intention of taking Richmond and he'll withdraw McClellan from Virginia back to Washington. Right? So that's called the peninsular campaign, and it's going to be seen as another defeat for. For the Union. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Okay, so now the result of that is that Lincoln is going to say, I don't like this guy McClellan because he's not winning battles. He's too timid. Right? You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, now let's move to the west. In the west, there's going to be a battle at a place called Shiloh. The thing that the guy who was leading the Union army at Shiloh was Ulysses Grant. Okay? Ulysses Grant had been in the army during the mexican war. He stayed in the army after the Mexican War and was stationed in California. But he was a drunk and he eventually drank his way out of the army and he moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Had a grocery store there. And then when the Civil War started, he signed up as a mustering officer. Okay? But through a series of battlefield promotions, he ends up in command of the army, Shiloh, in early 1862. Okay? And he's going to win the battle of Shiloh. And one of the things that will characterize him is that he will only accept unconditional surrender. So Lincoln will notice that. And Lincoln will start to really follow the career of Ulysses Grant while he's losing faith in his generals from. In Washington. Right? And so we'll just leave it at that for now and again, keep in mind this happened in the west, so it wasn't something that people in the east knew a lot about or felt close to. Okay, questions, comments about this. All right, next. Later that same year, Lee has a plan, and he's. Oops, I keep doing that. I'm sorry. The. Lee's plan is to invade the north. His idea is that if you march across. If you march across Maryland and you march into Pennsylvania and you get to Harrisburg, this thing here. Harrisburg. Right. That's where the railhead is. That connects the west to the east. And if you could cut the railhead in Harrisburg, that would cripple the Union army because they would not be able to get supplies from the west. Okay. And so his plan then is to cross over what's known as Antietam Creek at a place called Sharpsburg, which is. Sorry, I got this thing in the middle of my screen here. Sharpsburg is right there. Okay. His plan is to cross into across Antietam Creek at Sharpsburg and then march across Maryland and into Pennsylvania. What happens is that in those days when you were giving orders to your subordinate officers, obviously you couldn't use any kind of secure communications or emails or radio or anything like that, so you had to write down your orders, and somebody would actually physically carry them to where they were supposed to go to. Right. And so he wrote down his orders for his generals at his plan to cross at Sharpsburg, or as the union will call the Antietam Creek. Right. And the person, the messenger who was carrying the orders, dropped them on the road, and a union sympathizer picked them up. And so by the time he got. By the time Lee tried to cross the creek, to cross the river at Antietam Creek, McClellan already knew what his plan was, and he was able to defeat him. Right? So Antietam becomes the very first major victory of the Union army. Okay? And then after the battle of Antietam, Lincoln says to McClellan, go get Lee. Lee had to withdraw back into Virginia. And Lincoln says, go get him. And McClellan refused. He said, I can't go because my army's been too defeated. Right. And so then McClellan is fired. Okay. And they replace him with a man named Ambrose Burnside. Oh, yeah. Okay. They replace him with a man named Ambrose Burnside. This, let me show you here. This is Burnside. And the thing that we can that kind of cements this place in history is his facial hair, which became known as sideburns because of who he was. Right? Okay? So sideburns come from Burnside. Okay, I keep going the wrong direction here. Alright? So at any rate, Burnside will be in control of the army at a major battle at a place called Fredericksburg in Virginia, where his army is going to be slaughtered. He basically orders them against an impregnable confederate position in the middle of winter. And so he loses many men and he's fired. He's replaced with a guy named Joseph Hooker. All right? Now what we can remember about Joseph Hooker was that one of the ways that Hooker was able to keep his army intact, because in those days, men would just leave the army. They would just get up in the middle of the night and go because they. Because they were homesick or whatever, right? And so what Joseph Hooker did was he brought in ladies of the night, okay? And these ladies became known as Hooker's girls, okay? And so that's where we get to name Hooker. So I'm not sure that's what I'd like to be remembered for, but that's where our term for prostitutes come from, is from Hooker, Joseph Hooker. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Well, Hooker was in control of the army at another battle at Chancellorsville. This is probably, I think, the high water of the, of the confederate power because the Confederates are going to actually win this battle. But one of the things that happens during the battle is that Jackson, Stonewall Jackson, who is Lee's right hand man, is going to be killed. And what that does is it really weakens the Confederate a team. We talked about the a team before, right? So, so now the. The Confederate a team is weakened, even though the. The. He's still facing the b team in the east. All right? So. So then Hooker is fired. And then they put another general in charge, George Gordon Meade. And this is in the summer of 1863. Lee decides to try his invasion of the north again. Right? Now, one of the things I want you guys to notice here is that the confederate troops didn't have shoes, right? They marched on in bare feet, if you can believe it, okay? Because the confederacy was poor. Okay? So. So when Lee crossed into Pennsylvania. Oops, I've got the wrong one here. When Lee crossed into Pennsylvania, he knew that there was a shoe factory, a little town called Gettysburg. So he took his army to Gettysburg to get shoes for his army. And because of some, I guess you could say, intelligence mix ups, he ends up being trapped at Gettysburg by the Union army. Okay? And what follows then, is going to be a three day battle. You guys have probably all heard of the battle of Gettysburg, right? And the outcome of the battle going to be that Lee's army is destroyed. Lee can no longer fight an offensive war, and he's forced to withdraw back into Virginia. And from that point on, Lee will be fighting a defensive war against the Union troops. All right, you guys with me? Questions, comments about this. Now, at the same time, there's going to be another victory in the west. I don't. This. Maybe you can see it here. The thing that had happened in the west was that Louisiana had been restored to the Union very early in the war, but the United States couldn't control the Mississippi because there was a. There was a confederate fortification at a place called Vicksburg in Mississippi. And so in order to be able to open up the Mississippi River, Grant, General Grant, came up with a plan to take Vicksburg. The problem with taking Vicksburg was that there was an enormous confederate army to the east of Vicksburg. And most people thought that the only way to get to Vicksburg was to come in from the east, right somewhere over here. But what Grant does is he decides to cross the river and march without supplies through Arkansas and Louisiana and then recross the river south of Vicksburg and attack it from the east between the confederate army and Vicksburg. And that's going to be a winning strategy. So on the same day that the United States wins or that the Union wins the battle of Gettysburg, they also win the battle of Vicksburg. Okay. And the outcome of this is going to be that Lincoln will decide that he should put Grant in charge of all the armies. Okay? So Lincoln decides to make Grant the first general of all of the Union armies because he has a record of winning. He's not afraid. Right? Now, keep in mind that I told you before that Grant had been cashier from the army because he was a drunk. Okay? And there is some. Some evidence that he was a drunk even during the civil war, although he was. He was able to stay sober for most of it, right? But the. The. One of the. Probably the premier historian about the civil war conjectures that the reason why Grant was so successful was because he was a drunk. Because he was known as a drunk. He had a reputation as a drunk. And because of that, he knew that he was never going to have a political career. Nobody would ever want him to be in politics, because everybody knew he was a drunk. You guys get what I'm saying? So. So when Lincoln decides to make grant the general of all the armies, the other generals in the. In the east, the political generals, are going to say, well, you know, he drinks. Right? And. And Lincoln is going to say, well, find out what he's drinking and give a case to all my other generals. Right? And so anyway, that's just kind of an interesting story. Now, here's the difference between Grant and the rest of the political generals, let's say. Okay? And the difference is that where the other generals would attack, lose, and then retreat, Grant would attack, lose, but keep advancing. Right. The reason why is he knew that even though he was losing battles, he was going to win the war because he could replace his losses, and the south could not replace their losses. You guys are following me here. All right, so there's this, what they call the Petersburg campaign, where Grant attacks, loses a battle, then attacks again, then loses a battle, then attacks again and loses a battle. And attacks again and loses a battle. But what ends up happening is that he places a siege around Petersburg, and his siege goes from 1864 into the spring of 1865 with the trenches. And remember, I told you about the trenches, okay? And as the siege goes on, Grant keeps adding more and more and more troops, and Lee keeps losing more and more and more troops because they're deserting or they're getting killed and they can't be replaced. And so by the end of the siege, there's only one confederate soldier every 50ft along the trench lines, and most of them are either 13 year old boys or 60 year old men. Right? You guys are with me. And so what's going to happen is that Lee will eventually realize that he's not going to be able to win militarily, and so he will decide to retreat. And his plan is to retreat and to actually to wage a guerrilla warfare. Right. The idea being that they can't win a conventional war because the Union army is now too big, too powerful, so they're going to fight a guerrilla warfare. So what happens is that Lee flees, essentially, from Petersburg. The Union takes Richmond and Petersburg. And eventually what ends up happening is that Lee is surrounded at a little town called Appomattox courthouse. Okay? And then it's going. He's going to realize, I mean, on the last, really the last day, he orders his cavalry to attack the Union army. And when they go over the hill to attack, they see a sea of blue uniforms, essentially. Right? There's Lee has about 25,000 men, and the Union army is about 100,000 men. Okay. And they're going to realize they can't win. So Lee will be convinced that he needs to surrender. Right. He receives a. He receives a letter from Grant. And he responds to letters saying, well, I'll meet. I'll meet with you at this place called Appomattox courthouse. Right. And when they. What happens is that he. He sends somebody into appomattox courthouse to find a place for them to meet, and he runs into a guy. The guy who sent. Runs into a guy walking down the street. His name is Wilmer McLean. Okay. Or McLean. I'm not sure how to pronounce it, but if you guys will remember the very first. What was the very first battle that we talked about? Bull run. Was it the Boston tea party? No, I mean the one about the civil war. Right. Was the very first battle of the Civil War was that we talked about Bull run. Bull run. Okay. And remember where you do remember who the confederate general was there? Pierre Gustave, toutant Beauregard. And where did he have his headquarters? Remember I told you that he had his headquarters in something of a local farmer. The outdoor. The kitchen. The kitchen, exactly. All right, so Beauregard's headquarters was in the outdoor kitchen. The guy who owned the farm was named Wilmer McLean. And Wilmer McLean decides, after the battle of Bull run, he doesn't want to be in a war zone, so he picks up everything and moves to a little town called Appomattox Courthouse. And then on this morning in April of 1865, he meets somebody from Lee's army, who convinces him, reluctantly, to allow the meeting between Grant and Lee in his parlor. Right. And so Grant and Lee then meet in the parlor. Wilmer McLean. I think I have a. Yeah, this painting here, this is the meeting between Grant and Lee, and Lee surrenders the confederate army. And that's going to be essentially the end of the war. It's going to keep going on a little bit longer, but. But that's essentially the end, because Lee, essentially, by this time, is the Confederacy. Right. And so from then on, Wilmer McLean could say that the civil war started in his kitchen and ended in his parlor. And that's a true story, folks.",524

","Now, last thing I want to talk about, and this is an important thing for a number of reasons, right? But one of the reasons why the south believed that they could win the war in the beginning was because they were the major supplier of cotton to the british textile factories, and they believed that the British would try to preserve that relationship if they had to by allying with the Confederacy. Okay? And there was some. Some. They did consider it seriously, but it never happened. And the reason why was because by now, the british public is steadfastly against slavery, and Lincoln has, by now, made slavery the issue of the war. Right. He does it by this exact incident that we're going to talk about here. But we got to keep in mind that, remember that when Lincoln was elected, his promise was not to abolish slavery, but to limit slavery. And so even when we get to 1863 or even 1865, at the end of the war and after Lincoln is dead, slavery is still legal in Louisiana, Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware. These were all states that stayed in the Union even though they were slave states, and slavery was still legal in those states during the civil war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this, all right? But now Lincoln knows that if he can make the war about slavery, that will make it less likely that the British will intervene. And so what he's looking for is an opportunity to make an announcement about emancipation. Emancipation means freeing. Freeing the slaves, right? The problem is, as I mentioned to you guys, from the very beginning, most people think the south is winning, right? And so he feels that if he announces emancipation while everybody thinks the south is winning, it'll just be seen as a desperation move. Okay, so he waits until after the battle of Antietam. The battle of Antietam was, if you'll recall, the first major victory of the Union against the Confederacy. And then he announces his emancipation plan, right? His emancipation plan is that on the first day of January, 1863, all the slaves will be freed. Well, not quite. Okay, here's what it actually says. It says, on the first day of January, the year of our Lord, 1863, all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of the state. The people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward and forever free. Okay, how many slaves were freed by the emancipation Proclamation? It's an exact number. Zero. Zero. Do you see why? Do you see why the emancipation proclamation freed zero slaves crippled the south from any kind of, like. Well, yeah, it is that. Okay, you're right about that. But just think about what it says here, any state or designated part of a state the people were of shall then be in rebellion against the United States. What would that place. Where would those places be? Anybody can answer. How about Igor? In the south? Yeah, exactly. In the south. And how much authority does Lincoln's executive order have in the south? Do the southern States acknowledge Lincoln's executive orders? No. No. It would be like. It would be like if President Biden signed an order saying everybody in Mexico City gets ice cream. Right? Would that mean everybody in Mexico City gets ice cream? Who would connect? Who would, who in Mexico City would get ice cream based on Biden's order? Nobody. You follow what I'm saying here? And keep in mind that after the emancipation Proclamation, slavery continued in Kentucky and Missouri and Delaware, Maryland. Right. And Louisiana. Okay. All the way up until the 13th amendment, which is after Lincoln is already dead. Okay, so the emancipation proclamation doesn't free any slaves. Really? It practically. But what it really. What it does do is it makes slavery the issue of the civil war, and it prevents the British from actually intervening in the war. And it also, because the word gets out among the slave population in the south, it also deprives the south of labor because the slaves are going to start to desert their plantations and follow the Union army around. Okay, you guys are with me. So even though the emancipation proclamation doesn't actually free any slaves, it actually does help to bring about an end to the war. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Well, that's my story, and I'm sticking with it. Live long and prosper.",525

","Okay, well, today we're going to talk about reconstruction. It should be a relatively short lecture, and then I'll let you guys go. But we're going to say. Let me just ask this. What was the last thing that we talked about on Wednesday? The last thing I have is that the emancipation Proclamation freed zero slaves. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Why was that? It's good. I'm glad you brought that up, because I want us to realize why. Why it actually ended up freeing zero slaves. Because there was. Because it didn't. Because no one was listening to it where it mattered in the south. Right. No one. Okay. So I think a better way to say that is that Lincoln. Lincoln's authority was not recognized in the places where he abolished slavery and in places where his authority was recognized. And there was slavery. Slavery didn't end. Right. So there was still slavery in Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware and Louisiana, which were all back in the union. Right. And the emancipation Proclamation didn't do anything to slaves there. You guys get what I'm saying? So the purpose of the emancipation proclamation, does anybody remember what it really was? To keep the British out. Exactly. Keep the British out. Okay. Because the people of Britain were, by this time, very much anti slavery, and so they wouldn't have. Wouldn't have been willing to commit to a war that was in favor of preserving slavery, if that's what it's about. Okay, so Lincoln deliberately made the war about slavery. Okay, that makes sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? Okay. Now, one thing that I want you guys to understand about Americans and slavery is that over the course of the first half of the 19th century, more and more Americans came to believe that slavery was a moral evil, that it was a sin. But at the same time, people didn't recognize slaves as equals. And particularly, they didn't recognize black slaves as equals, because from the european point of view, Africans were inferior. They were savages, essentially. Right? And so white people were always better suited to democracy than black people. So even though there's a growing call for abolition, emancipation in the north, that doesn't mean that there's. There's a. That same call includes political rights for former slaves. Right? So one way that we could think about it. It's not a good way to think about it, but it demonstrates the thinking of the time. And that is to say that we could say that animal cruelty is wrong and that we should. We should prevent animal cruelty, but that doesn't mean that we should let dogs vote, right? You see what I'm saying? And that's the way people thought, okay, and so that's the situation then when we come to the end of the civil war and Lincoln has passed the emancipation Proclamation, and what that ends up doing is it does create a number of slave free slaves in the south. And these free slaves at the end of the war are following the armies, the Union armies around because they're expecting, hoping for protection from their former masters that they have deserted. Okay? And so at the end of the war, the United States is left with an enormous population of essentially refugees. And how are they going to deal with that? And one of the strategies of the Republican, the radical Republicans of this time was to create more citizens by granting citizenship to former slaves because that would then cement their control of the federal government. You guys follow what I'm saying? So if you turn the slaves into voters in places like Mississippi and Alabama, Georgia, then that would mean that the republican party could make gains in those states. And you will recall that before the civil war, republican party didn't even show up on the ballot in those states. You guys get what I'm saying? So when we get to the end of the war, the question of slavery, the question, the big question of the war, which was, is the union permanent? Can a state secede from the Union? That's been answered. But the, the kind of more symbolic cause of the war, slavery, is still up in the air. What are we going to do with these slaves, essentially? Okay. And that's where we go into the period known as reconstruction. All right. Questions, comments about this?",531

","All right, well, let's go. And the first thing I want to mention is, most of the time, many of us have heard that this era is called reconstruction. Now, I want somebody to tell me what, in general, not necessarily historically speaking, but in general, what does the word reconstruction mean? To rework, to reassemble, go back together, reconstruct. Okay. So, um, does that. Does that imply that what you're going to end up with is something new or something old? Reconstruct. Both. Let's ask the other question. What, in general, does the word restoration mean? To make new again or to put it back the way it was. Right. Okay. So if you have a house that's dilapidated, right. And you restore it, then it brings it back to the way it was. But if you reconstruct it, it's really a new house. Right. You see what I'm saying? And the reason why I'm bringing this up is because Lincoln believed that the south never really left the union. Okay? Lincoln believed that secession was illegal, and so therefore, the south was in rebellion against the United States. But they hadn't actually left the United States because you couldn't leave the United States. You follow what I'm saying? So Lincoln's strategy for putting the union back together was to restore it. Restoring it means put it back the way it was. All right. And we'll just keep that in mind for now, and we'll follow that through here, because Lincoln, in 1863, published a document, executive order proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction, in which 10% share screen. Oh, I'm not sharing screen. I'm sorry. All right. So Lincoln, in 1863, issued an executive order proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction, and that basically laid out a framework for reuniting, are restoring the union. And what that would mean, that was that 10% of the voters in a state that was in rebellion, if they voted to return to the union and to abolish slavery, they would be restored to the union. Okay? And this is actually a very lenient policy. Okay. It's not demanding anything other than that they give up their slaves, essentially. Right? And so by the time Lincoln was assassinated, already Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee had been restored to the Union under this proclamation. Right? And then in 1864, there's an election. The election is really. It's a. It's a. A test of whether or not people believe that the war should continue. And so in 1864, Lincoln did not run for president as a Republican. He ran for president as a member of the Union party, and he chose as his running mate Andrew Johnson, who was a Democrat from Tennessee. Southern Democrat. And the idea, the symbolism here essentially was that Lincoln was not running as a Republican, but he was running in favor of Union. So the election then is going to be focused on whether or not the war should continue to restore the Union. You guys follow what I'm saying here? You guys get this, okay? All right. So Lincoln's actually going to win that election, but we want to keep in mind that the reason why he chose Andrew Johnson as his running mate was more symbolic than in real. But unbeknownst to anybody, Lincoln was actually assassinated right after Appomattox. And so Andrew Johnson ends up becoming president. Right. But Andrew Johnson's view of the war was very different from, from Lincoln's view and from the view of the Republicans who control Congress, the so called radical Republicans. So Johnson is going to have real trouble in office, and we'll see how that works out here. Okay.",532
96,"US1: 533 -US1: 533
","These are the three civil war amendments. These are the three civil. The amendments to the Constitution that come out of the civil war. Right. The first one, the 13th, abolishes slavery. The 14th defines citizenship, which is basically the idea that anybody born in the United States is a citizen. The reason why it's defined that way is because the Republicans wanted to make sure that all of the former slaves were citizens so they could vote. You guys get what I'm saying? So that's the reason why we have so called birthright citizenship. They wanted to make sure that everybody, all the slaves had been born in the United States, and so therefore, they automatically became citizens when the 14th Amendment took effect. You guys get what I'm saying? So that added, because they were thought to be beholden to the Republicans for their freedom, then they would support the republican party, which they did, generally speaking, at that time. Okay, questions, comments about this? Okay. So the other thing about the 14th Amendment, though, is it turns out to be a really important amendment to the Constitution because it enforces equality, okay? So this due process and equal protection, what that means is that you can't single out any group of people for more or less privilege, okay? And so many of the civil rights protections that we've seen since the civil war are based on the 14th Amendment. For example, the brown versus the Board of education, which struck down Jim Crow, which we'll talk about here in a few minutes, but basically struck down the segregation laws between blacks and whites was done on the basis of the 14th Amendment saying that you could not identify whites for more privileges or blacks for less privileges, that all are equal citizens, and all have to be treated as equal citizens. Okay? And same thing, then this is going to be the basis, then, for the same sex marriage. The Supreme Court will rule that states can't rule, states can't legislate against a group of people defined as a group, because everybody needs to be treated equally. So what the. What the Supreme Court does isn't to. Isn't to make same sex marriage legal. What it does is it says that you can't pass laws against it, right? So effectively, then it does become legal because you can't pass laws against it because everybody's equal. Everybody has equal rights. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? The 14th amendment is a very important amendment to the constitution. And I think you read that, if you remember when you read that little book by Pauline Meyer where she talked about the 14th Amendment, really adds some meat to the civil rights, to the Bill of Rights, okay? Questions? Comments about that. All right. The 15th amendment, then, is the right to vote. Now, the way it was written, the idea was that the Republicans wanted the former slaves to be able to vote in the south, but they didn't want Asians to be able to vote in California. So they basically granted the right to vote to all males, but at the same time allowed for some loopholes that could prevent people from voting, like poll taxes and grandfather clauses and things like that, literacy tests, things that eventually end up being used against black people in the south. Okay, so that's one of the reasons why it was easier for those people who tried to redeem the south. Keep that word in mind. Redeem. For those people who tried to redeem the south to prevent black people from voting.",533

","So then, when Lincoln was assassinated, Johnson became president. But Johnson, as I mentioned, was out of step with the. With the Congress. The Republicans in Congress. He favored Lincoln's lenient plan, but opposes the extension of political rights to former slaves, which means that he was in favor of the 13th but not the 14th amendment. Right. And then he said that if the. If the south ratified the 13th amendment, repudiated confederate debt, they could be. All the rights and property would be restored. And so, by the end of 1865, all but one of the states had been restored to the Union. Okay? Is it with me? Questions? Comments about this. Now, remember that Lincoln's second election occurred in 1864. And that means in 1866, there were what we call midterm elections. What are midterm elections? Who gets elected in midterm elections? Representatives. Representatives. Congress. And there's a number of other people, too. But what about the president? No, you don't. Right. You don't vote for president in the midterms. Okay? That's why they call them midterms, because it's mid presidential term. Okay? Midterm elections. So all of the House of Representatives and one third of the Senate gets reelected every two years. Okay, guys are following me here. All right, so, in 1866, the Republicans won a veto proof majority in Congress. What is a veto proof majority? Think about this. First off, what is a veto? They reject a decision or proposal made by Congress. All right, so Congress passes a law, but it doesn't become law until the president signs it. And if the president is against it, then he will veto it. Okay? Now, once the president has vetoed a bill, then what happens to it? Is it dead? Can't they do a majority vote to overturn the veto? Exactly. You need a two thirds majority vote in Congress to overturn the veto. Right. So. So the idea then, is that the Congress passes a law and the president vetoes it. But if Congress can muster a two thirds majority, it still becomes law anyway, right? And so a veto proof majority would be how many for the Congress to be able to pass laws that the president couldn't veto. How many? How big of a majority would that be? It's still two thirds, isn't it? Right, exactly. So if the Congress. I mean, we have a veto proof majority now in California, right, where the Democrats control so much of the assembly, in the state senate, that if the governor decided to veto a law, they could override it easily. Right. You see? I'm saying. And the same thing is what happened? What happened in the United States in 1866? Republicans gained enough of a majority in Congress that no matter what Johnson said, whatever they passed would become law. All right, you guys get what I'm saying? Okay, well, that's important because Johnson didn't agree with Congress on many things, right. Particularly on the idea of reconstruction. So what happens then is that Johnson, when he becomes president, wants to appoint his own cabinet. And when I say cabinet, I don't mean where he keeps the liquor, right? I'm talking about the people that serve him. Okay? And the like, the secretary of state, secretary of war, secretary of treasury. Those people are his cabinet. And you guys will recall that the way that somebody becomes a cabinet member. We've actually just seen it this year. Right. The way that somebody becomes a cabinet member is that the president nominates them for the position, and then the Senate approves them or not. Right, right. And so what happened was that Johnson decided to appoint a new cabinet after Lincoln was assassinated, but the Republicans didn't want him to have a new cabinet because the cabinet that Lincoln had was on their side. They were radical Republicans, and Johnson wanted to replace them. You guys follow me here? All right, so what ends up happening then is that the Congress will pass a law called the tenure of office act. And the tenure of Office act essentially says that the president can't change his cabinet members without the approval of Congress. Right? Well, that's kind of true anyway, but what happens is that Johnson ignores that and he replaces the secretary of war with Ulysses Grant, and then that will trigger an impeachment. Okay, so now we've seen this actually twice in the last two years, so we should understand what impeachment looks like. But let's just go ahead and walk through it. What? How does impeachment work? If you say the president is impeached, what does that mean? That Congress has tried to vote the official out. Okay, so now that's kind of a misunderstanding that Americans have. When we say impeachment, we think that means removal. But removal can be a consequence of impeachment. But impeachment doesn't automatically lead to removal. All right? So that means impeachment must be something other than removal. What is impeachment? There's charges against the elected official. Exactly. Charges. So, for example, this year, when Trump was impeached for the second time, the charges against him was that he instigated a riot at the Capitol. Right? Okay. Now, obviously, we're not going to litigate that here in this class, but what we will say is that he was accused of that, and the House of Representatives, by majority vote, made that accusation. Okay, so that means he was impeached. But what happens after the president then is impeached? Who decides whether or not the president actually did what he was accused of doing? The Senate. Exactly. The Senate. So impeachment is done by the House. House of Representatives will accuse the president of committing high crimes and misdemeanors. And then the Senate tries the president, and the outcome of that trial will either be acquittal or removed from office. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying here? Questions, comments about that? Is it like, is it like in, like if you get suspended or expelled in school, like, the people, people will decide that, like, what happens? Well, if you get, if you get suspended or expelled from school, you can get back into school, but if you get removed from office, you cannot go back into office. You cannot even run for office again. Does that answer your question? Well, I thought it spelled meant, like, you can't come back, but suspended means you can come back, right? Exactly. But you can't suspend the president, but you can actually expel him from office. That's the same thing as removal from office. But you just said no because you said impeach isn't removal. Right. It doesn't necessarily mean, keep in mind impeachment is an accusation that's made by the House and then removal. What happens with that accusation is the Senate prize it. Okay, so let's say that I committed a misdemeanor, I stole a candy bar, right. And somebody caught me. So I go to court and I've been accused of stealing a candy bar. Right. It's going to be the court that decides whether or not I actually did steal the candy bar. You see what I'm saying? So that's, yeah, so the, so the charge of stealing the candy bar is impeachment. And then what happens with that? Impeachment? It goes to court and court decides whether or not I'm guilty or innocent. In this case, I was guilty, but hey, because I said I stole it, right? You guys are with me, but they didn't read me my rights. So anyway, does that make sense then? You see how that works? Yeah, it makes sense. Okay. So the one difference that we got to keep in mind is that impeachment is a political process. It's not a judicial process. So the same rules that apply to a court don't apply to the Senate. Okay. They get to decide not based on the law, but based on their own decision, what's legal and what isn't legal. All right. Because there were many questions, comments about that. All right, well, anyway. So Johnson's impeached. He's not removed from office. The impeachment fails by one vote in the Senate. And then, but because of the fact that he had been impeached and because of the fact that there was a veto proof majority in Congress, then what that means is that Johnson essentially became ineffective as president and the country was essentially ruled directly from the congressman.",534

","When the Congress takes over, when the president no longer has any authority, then they change the whole direction of the restoration process. Right? So you'll recall I just said less than ten minutes ago that by the end of 1865, ten of the eleven states had been restored to the union. But what happens then is that in 1867, the Congress will pass a new law called the First Reconstruction act of 1867. Or basically, it's just called the Reconstruction act of 1867, and that removes all of the states from the union again. All of the states that have been restored to the union are now removed from the union again. All right? And it divides the country, the south, up into five military districts is what we see here. Okay? Now, here's where we want to. We want to differentiate between what we call first reconstruction, or second and second reconstruction, or restoration and reconstruction. The first reconstruction was presidential. Lincoln started it, and Johnson continued it. Right? It was started by the proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction of 1863. The idea behind it was that the southern states never seceded because it was illegal. They were in rebellion. And because of that, we just need to restore the union back to the way it was. Okay? And that the presidential. The presidential responsibility for restoration is based on the idea that the southern states didn't secede. Okay, because if the southern states didn't secede and they were in rebellion, then it's the executive department that will figure out how to put down the rebellion. But if the states did secede and then they were conquered by union troops, which they were, then that means that this is conquered territory. It's just like new territory. Okay, so how would you actually. Who would get to add new territory to the country? Is it the president or the Congress? The Congress, exactly. As we saw, Congress actually is the one that actually adds states to the Union. Right. Okay. So that's the basis, then, for what we were going to call. We are going to call second reconstruction or congressional reconstruction, which goes into effect with the first Reconstruction act of 1867, with the theory that the southern states actually did secede from the union, and because they seceded, then when they were conquered, that's all new territory that can be added in whatever way that the Congress wants to add it. Okay? And the difference then between the presidential plan and the congressional plan is that the presidential plan was lenient and the congressional plan was punitive. The presidential plan was just, you know, just put down your arms, and we're just going to put this back to the way it was. The congressional plan was, we're going to tear the society down and replace it. We're going to reconstruct the south. You guys follow what I'm saying? And it's going to be reconstructed on the basis of black citizenship and black voting. Okay, you guys are all following me here. Questions, comments about this? All right? Okay. So then the second reconstruction, or the first Reconstruction act tries to implement its plan for reconstructing the south through an entity that they create called the freedmen's Bureau. I think we may have already read about the Freedmen's bureau, but even if we didn't, the idea behind the freedmen's bureau was that we wanted to. The Freedmen's Bureau was supposed to essentially act as a government for the former slave population that would protect them from the white population. Okay? And this is going to become the basis then for the animosity, or I should say it's not the basis of it, but it feeds into the animosity between blacks and whites because whites are going to be resentful of blacks receiving special protection from the federal government against whites. Okay? So the one thing you got to kind of keep in mind here is that from the point of view of white southerners, their whole world has been crushed. The idea that this idea, the social idea that they had of white supremacy and that blacks were inferior and couldn't be a part of the social contract. Right. Was over. Was turned on its head. And what that did was it created a backlash. And the freedmen's bureau actually fed into that backlash by actually defending, sometimes over defending the rights of blacks. You guys follow what I'm saying here? And so that's going. The freedmen's bureau then, that was supposed to create a situation where former slaves could actually participate in society, which they were able to do to some extent, but they could only do it with the support of federal troops. Federal troops were stationed throughout the south to enforce these civil rights laws. You guys follow what I'm saying? All right, you guys are with me, right? Questions, comments about this? Okay, so basically then, with the situation of second reconstruction, people in the south are very upset with the federal government. They feel that the federal government is tampering with their cherished beliefs and their social ideas, and they're against it. Right? And they have animosity toward the former slaves because the former slaves, from their point of view, are receiving special attention from the federal government.",535

","From the period of 1867 to the election of 1876, the country is going to change quite a bit. One of the things that happens after the civil war is the United States begins to rapidly industrialize. So we saw industrialization in the north before the civil war. After the civil war, the United States will become more and more devoted to industrialization, so that by the end. By the beginning of the 20th century, the United States is the most powerful industrial nation on earth. But it's going to be at the. To the detriment of. Of reconstruction or of race relations or civil rights, because the republican party, as I mentioned, is always the party of big business. Right? So their focus then is going to be. It's going to move away from civil rights and towards big business. So what happens then is that the interest in recreating the south is going to. Is going to diminish over time. Okay. People in the north are going to be saying, well, okay, we freed them, now it's up to them, right? And they don't. They don't continue the freedmen's bureau, right? And then there is a push in the south for what's called redemption. And redemption means, from their point of view, from. I mean, we heard redemption song at the beginning of the class today, right? That's one idea of redemption, but that's not the southerners idea of redemption. The southerners idea of redemption was to be redeemed from former slave rule. That's not the word they used, but that's what it meant. Right. They wanted to be redeemed from black rule. Okay, we'll put it that way. All right. And so what they did was they tried to pass laws to prevent blacks from voting, which they couldn't get away with as long as reconstruction was going on. And not only that, but there was the rise of a group known as the Ku Klux Klan, which essentially was a terrorist organization that prevented, it sought to prevent by violence the participation of black people in society. Right? So there's a legal and an extralegal push against reconstruction. Okay, you guys. You guys get that? Questions? Comments? All right, so now let's talk about the presidents, right? We had Lincoln. Lincoln was assassinated. Johnson. Johnson was impeached, and he left office after four years, didn't try to run for reelection, and then Ulysses Grant was elected. Does anybody want to try and guess why Ulysses Grant was so popular? See? Help win the civil war. He didn't help win the civil war from the point of view of Americans. He won the civil war. Right? And Americans love war heroes. Okay? That's why they had elected Jackson, who's a war hero, and pretty much everybody from then all the way up until now, generally speaking, will run on their military record. Right? And almost every president I can't think of. I know there's one, two. There's been two that I can think of that have never been in the military. Right, okay, so that would be Obama and Trump. Okay. But anyway, the point here is that, is that Grant was elected president. He was widely popular, but his administration was incredibly corrupt. It was one of the most corrupt administrations in history. Okay. And the reality behind all that was that actually grant himself wasn't corrupt, but he surrounded himself with corrupt people. Right? And so by the time we get to 1860. 618 76. Sorry, 1876, people realize that the government is incredibly corrupt and they need to do something about it, right? So the election of 1876 is going to be between two men. Rutherford Hayes, who is a Republican, and Samuel Tilden, the Democrat. Okay? Ruthford B. Hayes is a civil war hero, essentially. Right? And the problem with the election of 1876 is that two different states have not yet been fully reinstated to the union, and they both provide two different sets of electors. All right, so let's think back now just to this last election last year, right? Then there was a lot of talk about, okay, well, the electoral votes of the state were supposed to be decided by the majority of the population, but there were. There was some false information that said that the states could actually override that and just provide their own slate of electors. Right. Which is what they were trying a lot. Some people said, okay, well, Michigan, Pennsylvania. Why don't you just pass a law because you're controlled by Republicans, that makes republican electors. Right. They couldn't do that. But it's not really legal. Okay. And they didn't. They didn't do it. But the idea was that they could. Right? And so if that. So basically, then what happens is that the election of 1876 can't be decided by the electoral college. Okay, well, if the. If the. If the election can't be decided by the electoral college, who decides? We saw this with Jefferson. We saw it with Jackson. The majority. Majority of what? Population? People? No. United States doesn't. Nobody wins elections by majority vote in the United States. The presidency is not decided by the majority of the population. How is the presidency decided? By electoral votes. Right, okay. And electoral votes come from the states, and it's up to the states to decide how to provide those electoral votes. Right? But if the electoral college can't make a decision, then who decides? We've already seen it twice. We saw it in the election of 1800, and we saw it in the election of Andrew Jackson. Or actually, really the election of John Quincy Adams. Congress. Congress decides what part of Congress. You're absolutely right. The House chooses the House of Representatives. Exactly. Well, here's the problem. The House of Representatives by this time is controlled by Democrats. Right. And Hayes had actually won the popular vote. Okay. Hayes is a Republican, remember? So there's a fear that if the, if the election goes to the House, that the Democrat would win even though the Republican had won the majority of the votes. You guys get what I'm saying? So this creates a political crisis. And what they do is they appoint a commission. And this commission of democratic and republican congressmen essentially reaches a compromise. And this compromise is called compromise of 1877, or depending. Sometimes it's called the compromise of 1876. It's also called the revolution of 1876. And we'll talk about why that might be in a minute. Right. Okay. But the tenets of the compromise are going to be these. Get your pencils out and write this down. Right. The tenants of the compromise are going to be that Hayes will win the election and Hayes will agree to appoint a southern Democrat to his administration, which he does. The postmaster general becomes a southern Democrat. Right. And the last one is that the federal troops will be removed from the south. Okay. So now let's talk about that last issue. The federal troops are removed from the south. Why would the south be interested in that? Why would the. Why? What are the federal troops doing in the south? How did they get there? When did they get there? They're there to protect the former slaves. Right? When did they get there? You're absolutely right. The first Reconstruction act. When. No, they. It was. They were there because of the civil war. They never. They never came out. Right. They were just left there after the civil war, and they became the. The protectors of the. The Freedmen's Bureau, essentially. Right. Okay, so if the federal troops are removed, what would be the result of that? What would be the consequence of that? If they're there protecting the civil rights of black people and they're removed, what would be the consequence of that? They wouldn't have to follow the rules. Well, exactly. And that's what we call. Remember we talked about redemption a couple minutes ago. Right. Redemption. As you could say, the south redeemed. What it really means is the imposition of white majority rule over the south by disenfranchising the former slaves. All right, now, we've talked about this before. What is the franchise? Voting. Voting, exactly. So if the black. If the former slaves are disenfranchised, what does that mean? Can't vote. They can't vote. Exactly. And there's. The way that they do it is by these loopholes that were allowed in the 15th amendment. Okay. With poll taxes and literacy tests and grandfather clauses and things like that. The whole idea here is that, is that the south was able to prevent black people from exercising their political and their civil rights, and they did it legally through something we call Jim Crow. Right. So I want you to go ahead and write down this definition. Jim Crow is the creation of a legally separate, inferior class based on race. Creation of a legally inferior class based on race. Okay. That's Jim Crow. Otherwise known as segregation. Right. And as far as the south is concerned, that's the end of the civil war. They won, essentially. They couldn't get slavery back. But the. The experience of black people in the south was not much better than it was during slavery. Okay. And that's not going to change, then for another century. Okay. Or almost a century. All right. Questions, comments about this? Okay. So when you read the document that we're going to discuss on Wednesday, what you will see will be a. The document by Du Bois will show you the slide away from reconstruction and into Jim Crow. That's really the kind of the theme of that particular chapter, and I think it's important for us to really take a look at that.",536
